[SPEAKER_02]: This is someone that's really special to
us, someone that we're really inspired by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't get a lot of light shined on him
just because he's way up there in
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even know where that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that in Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's our good friend Kenny right
here, Mount Baker Highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love him a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to tell us about his farm and
his practices up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows incredible herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love, we go with strains, grows a
little bit of our strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got mad love for you, Kenny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it up for Kenny, Mount Baker Highway.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: A little hashed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was like thinking about what to
talk to you guys about and I think like
[SPEAKER_07]: we're all into regenerative farming and
we're all growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all put stuff in pots, you know,
and like soil, like what are we using for
[SPEAKER_07]: our potting soil media?
[SPEAKER_07]: Figured that's what I was going to talk
about tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys don't know me,
but I don't know everybody here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm not everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got a farm up in Washington and
yeah, we have a rec license and we do like
[SPEAKER_07]: outdoor mostly and write that all on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't do any lights or
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all closed loop pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we don't, when we started,
we were buying potting soil and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: organic and we just needed potting soil in
the beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next season, the market
crashed or like at the end of that year,
[SPEAKER_07]: we were like, we had no money in spring or
the next season.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just kind of went on this like
journey of learning how to like make our
[SPEAKER_07]: own soil on the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically what I started doing was I
just, I was doing compost and that was
[SPEAKER_07]: like, okay, I'm making compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got manure and I got like, I was using
mushroom blocks, spent mushroom blocks I
[SPEAKER_07]: would collect at the local mushroom farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was going on our beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was compost, but like we had no money.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like a struggling rec farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like me and my sister trying to make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we just like started sifting our
compost with a half inch screen,
[SPEAKER_07]: just over like a wheelbarrow for a full
rec farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, yeah, we did, that season we
did, I think like 10 yards or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was a good amount by hand over a
wheelbarrow, just a frame and stapled up,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it worked and we were a little late
to the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we learned that year you got to
be a little bit ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just like make your soil in
spring and be ready to go, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually worked though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was surprising.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had decent enough success.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, we grew fireweed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it wasn't like top notch,
the perfect soil that year, but we were
[SPEAKER_07]: able to like have a great farm and like,
you know, pay, you know, four people like
[SPEAKER_07]: me and my sister.
[SPEAKER_07]: And two other employees a whole year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pretty good, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next step was I realized,
oh, I need a lot more soil because I want
[SPEAKER_07]: to be like, sexy, my plants and pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like the goal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have that much soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for my farm, like, you know,
I feel like I need to buy 25 to 50 yards
[SPEAKER_07]: of soil realistically to sex all my plants
and four young pots, which is minimal to
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to go like seven, but you know,
soil is expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like linked up with that mushroom
farm locally.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, we're certified organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sawdust and organic like grain,
like whatever's like, I think it's holes,
[SPEAKER_07]: some kind of grain holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's a really clean input and it's
like super ground up already.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it makes great compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we just started taking our our
cannabis chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: We chip up all the cannabis at the end of
the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would clean out our cow manure from
the cow we had.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started with one cow and like just like
the next year got a little better.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a little bit ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soil was super fire and it was still
fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like we had it done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to say we had it like sifted in
February or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's still a little fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I'm at the point now where,
yeah, right now I've been turning my
[SPEAKER_07]: compost pile all summer for next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like I already have like a 60
yard windrow just sitting in the field
[SPEAKER_07]: ready to go and, you know, I do a
thermophilic compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means I'm heating it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, you know, it's killing off
whatever seeds and bacteria or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty like intuitive about how I'm
doing it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, you pile up a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just gets really hot essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, sorry, I'm kind of rambling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, where was I?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thermophilic compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I get it going.
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like turn it three times now with my
tractor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the third time I bring it into
like my covered area and it heats up one
[SPEAKER_07]: last time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And after that, I sift it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once it cools down like below,
you know, 100 degrees, I'll sift it and
[SPEAKER_07]: then let it, let that sit for another
month or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then I'm rocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like March and getting going.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you gotta, if you want to like do your
own soil, it's a bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta have a lot of collection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that mushroom farm I go every Monday
and I fill up like four to six yards of
[SPEAKER_07]: mushroom box in my truck by hand every
single week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I unload them and I de-bag them
by hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking shit load of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, I don't, I don't pay for soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually I make enough compost that I
don't even, I don't pay for compost either
[SPEAKER_07]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, yeah, the wrecking is hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you, if you're trying to like set
yourself apart, like you need to be,
[SPEAKER_07]: have a niche.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like my niche that I chose is that,
you know, we're going to be regenerative
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're going to do a closed loop
system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just feel like a lot of people don't
talk about like what they're actually
[SPEAKER_07]: using for soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what most people are
using for potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it seems a little mysterious and
it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like a lot of people don't realize
they could just sift their compost and let
[SPEAKER_07]: it sit, you know, and then put that into
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sift it with a half inch screen and
then sift it on a quarter inch screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure that's the, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be like one size up for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not complicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and I run like 10,000 square feet
every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good size farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and like two other guys pretty much
farming it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we crush.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually ended up to sift the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do like a 60 yard wind row.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not doing it over the,
the wheelbarrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we made it what's called like a
trommel and you can find these like videos
[SPEAKER_07]: online.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little mysterious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking about maybe like selling the
schematics for my trommel, but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: essentially like a rotating screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like on a slight tilt and there's a
frame around it and you just shovel into
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like rotating and all the solids
are kind of like, you know, shaking off
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever's on there and it's falling down
the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's falling that out the end of
it into the wheelbarrow, all the solids,
[SPEAKER_07]: like whatever didn't fully compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like super, super easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just like work for a whole week.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're shoveling into the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess I didn't sound that easy,
but you guys can do like 60 yards in a
[SPEAKER_07]: week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think that's pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not paying any like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not paying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm paying for like peat moss.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peat moss is like, yeah, peat moss.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's from like peat bogs that are ancient
and they're not coming back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's a weird thing that we just like
take that out of the ground and it's kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of important for the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like every time you buy a bag of soil,
it's like, ah, it shouldn't really feel,
[SPEAKER_07]: it should feel a little wrong because
you're just like robbing it from one place
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's, and they just kill all these
microbes that are these ancient microbes,
[SPEAKER_07]: like cooking it off in these ovens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, anybody got any questions about
making soil, like making your own potting
[SPEAKER_07]: soil with like nothing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing with your cow manure?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you integrating that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So after we got linked up with that
mushroom farm and like I do that every
[SPEAKER_07]: week, I get the mushroom blocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really low nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just mostly wood chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like sawdust really.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, so you need, you need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cows, cows are good for me because I had
pastures and it's already fenced.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, I was like, all right,
I'm doing some cows.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I started off with a bull and like one
bull gives you a good amount of manure,
[SPEAKER_07]: like a small farm of one cow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just crush it like a, like a home,
home size, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm up to like five cows now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I mean, I didn't spend any money
on them either.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like Craigslist, you know,
free, just like keep your eyes out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your local farmer, like Paige,
like people are always in a buying,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you know, like there's fires or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can like really save somebody's
animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, so I have all these like dairy
rejects.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up in dairy country in Washington and
like, they're not like meat cows
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily, but they're great for manure
and they're super sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, cows have good energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it puts a little bit into the weed,
you know, as it matters.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have a barn out in one of my fields
and for the winter time, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you got to feed the cows and like
currently I'm not on like a super
[SPEAKER_07]: intensive rotation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like the goal is someday to be
rotating the cows through the pasture like
[SPEAKER_07]: all year and not hang.
[SPEAKER_07]: But currently we, we hay the field in the
summer and we feed the cows hay in the
[SPEAKER_07]: winter and kind of like restrict their
access to the rest of the fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're in this barn and I feed them
hay in the barn and they just like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they shit where they stand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just toss all these hay bales in and
they move it around and they basically
[SPEAKER_07]: like cover it up every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you throw like an extra bit of hay
in, you're adding enough nitrogen to that
[SPEAKER_07]: carbon mix with the manure that it
actually like becomes a radiant heat
[SPEAKER_07]: floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It becomes like a compost pile in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called like a deep litter system or
deep bedding system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Works super good.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cows like don't want to go out of the
barn.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they like just want to hang out
and like chill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it smells pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells kind of sweet usually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once it gets going, like right now it's a
little early for me because I just started
[SPEAKER_07]: haying them like two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by December it's like toasty and I can
look out there and there's a little steam
[SPEAKER_07]: coming out of their like barn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's like one side's open on the
barn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really nice because I can just
drive in and grab that manure in the
[SPEAKER_07]: springtime and pull it out with my tractor
and throw it in the wind.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that became my nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, it's really bad ass soil now
that we're making.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this year I ended up, you know,
we do everything from seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I start stuffing like seed cells and I
move up to half gallons.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just had a bunch of stuff in half
gallons for a long time because things are
[SPEAKER_07]: piling up, you know, oh, I got to change
greenhouse plastic this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know I needed to like,
you know, things sat in pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I was just super amazed that
like the plants in these half gallon pots
[SPEAKER_07]: just stayed green and just kept growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they like got like this tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just green and they're healthy and
happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really like, it's just not that
complicated to make your own soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can find like local sources.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most mushroom farms like pay people to
take that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially because they got to remove the
bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, if you're just trying to make
your soil for like, you know, your home
[SPEAKER_07]: garden, like, man, just go get a load of
mushroom blocks and add it to your pile
[SPEAKER_07]: and it'll be a long way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like do it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like a really cool resource.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wood chips in general are super good,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just take a little longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like just amplify that time by maybe three
or four times.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what'd I say?
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes like five months for me to do my
compost system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like totally from like, I'm starting to
turn it to when I'm using it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the collection process takes,
you know, however long it takes to collect
[SPEAKER_07]: that pile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but that's pretty, it's pretty
simple, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need is some nitrogen,
some carbon, and you can make your own
[SPEAKER_07]: soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you don't need perlite.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't used perlite in four years,
five years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm just cruising.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, maybe if I was growing like in a
pot, it would be a little more of a thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, I'm going in the ground,
like that's just a small portion of its
[SPEAKER_07]: existence is in the pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but it's cool to make it on the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels really rewarding to like just not
be a part of that system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, like I'm looking at the
ground here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all wood chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you pile it up and make potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's so many struggling farmers
out there just getting swindled into all
[SPEAKER_07]: these like products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's all this charlatanry and like,
yeah, you can just make it all with what
[SPEAKER_07]: you got.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can make your JMS, you know,
if you got the aphids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can make your potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you don't have to have the fancy
trommel.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just need a wheelbarrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, it's super simple, especially
for home gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and it's, it's the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have any questions anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your chicken systems the
last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do chickens for myself and my family and
my staff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just do like, like this year I did 120
birds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do, I just do pastured chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I have some thoughts on it
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Raising chicken is just a grain game,
you know, like, I haven't found a way to
[SPEAKER_07]: get past this industrial raising chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you're trying to raise meat birds,
like, I don't know a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't on some kind of industrial grain
wagon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I love chicken and I like raising
chickens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, in my long term vision,
I want to learn how to raise the chickens
[SPEAKER_07]: off the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's points of the compost pile when it
turns into a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like a billion worms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I haven't exactly figured out like,
how to time that up with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I have chickens, but the way I'm
raising them now, I do chicken tractors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have like a cage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a big box, rectangular box and like,
wake up in the morning, grab a bucket of
[SPEAKER_07]: water, some grain, and go out and feed
them or move them because they're hungry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they look, they come to me and they're
like, looking at me and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_07]: come on chickens, pull it forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they come usually.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I give them the grain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it takes like no time, you know,
it takes me like, man, if I'm in a rush,
[SPEAKER_07]: it takes me four minutes to fill the
bucket of water, grab the grain,
[SPEAKER_07]: feed the chickens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like, it takes about,
it's like eight to 10 weeks usually,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think is what people, most people do.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I usually do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this year I raised my chickens for 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like, kind of like an indoor weed
crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of my issue with it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like from that, perspective of it's a
grain game and we need to figure out how
[SPEAKER_07]: to like remove ourselves from the grain
with the chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause like the chickens can live off of
other stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, raising for like 10 weeks and
they do a really good job on the field.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if they're moving in a grid,
so you can kind of look into the field and
[SPEAKER_07]: see like six months later, you can see
like, wow, like grass, right in that grid
[SPEAKER_07]: is really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so I got, I have a couple now like
poops, I'll move around and it's actually
[SPEAKER_07]: like, they evenly fertilize really nice
patches of your yard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it brings a lot of health to the
pasture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's probably like, you know,
that's the second most fulfilling thing
[SPEAKER_07]: after like gravy, you know, like eating
the chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, damn, it really improves
the land.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I can't get past that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Idea that I'm just like buying industrial
grain to, to improve my land, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got, I'm buying like soy free
organic, like the best I can find for
[SPEAKER_07]: where I'm at, but I'm kind of scheming up
a, a worm fed chicken plan, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I think it's easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's just a timing thing
really, and having the pile at the right
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, raising your chickens are easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everybody should like,
dude, if you, if you can, and you eat
[SPEAKER_07]: meat, like, I think I raised my birds for
$16 this year, a piece and they're each
[SPEAKER_07]: like the smallest for about three pounds,
pretty good size, but the biggest for like
[SPEAKER_07]: 5.8 pounds, like Christmas chickens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's always, there's always like
a gradient because there's a packing
[SPEAKER_07]: order.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always huge chickens and there's
always like a really tiny rent fund.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just rent the harvesting equipment
locally in most areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a farm service agency you can
reach out to like, or a conservation
[SPEAKER_07]: district is in my area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like 30 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and you got everything to harvest
like, you know, 200 chickens in a day or
[SPEAKER_07]: something.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got enough hands, you can do a lot of
chickens in a day with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really cost effective and you
know, you need to buy the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get my chickens from a local hatchery.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super lucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's right down the road for me
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like recently, I've like kind of been
looking like, there's a lot of really
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting chickens you can buy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you want legs, you can get like leg
chickens and you want breast chickens,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can get breast chickens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, what's your average cost per
pound?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not off the top of my head, I can say,
but I did 120 chickens at $16 a bird this
[SPEAKER_07]: year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just not sure at the poundage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So average at like three, three pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely three pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Average at three and a half, three,
three and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: $16 a bird.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like five bucks a pound for organic
chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this year is the year I was like,
I'm not even, I've been trying to work it
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've been trying to like play that
game where I'm like, I kind of want to
[SPEAKER_07]: sell chickens as an enterprise for the
farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, as a, you know, diversified
farm, like, so I'm playing around with it
[SPEAKER_07]: for myself, but I just, I kind of decided
against it and just to do it on my own
[SPEAKER_07]: scale because you got to put up,
it's just like, you got to put up the
[SPEAKER_07]: money beforehand to raise the chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an interesting, it's an
interesting gig, like that grain game.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just an industrial game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you tried breeding in meal worms or
black soldier fly larvae or anything like
[SPEAKER_07]: that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't, but I'm, I'm up by the border.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm a little cold for the black
soldier fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're up on the tip of Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's kind of why I'm onto the worm
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I make a lot of worms.
[SPEAKER_07]: My soil is kind of mostly like a,
I mean, really it's like worm cast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grasses pure is what I make in the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like really, but it's a low nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's not super high nitrogen
with the balance, I'm using and.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, man, I think the bugs,
like that's how you feed the chickens,
[SPEAKER_07]: the bugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the real, I call away.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your, what's your other ideas on to
switching away from grain?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I know raising chickens,
it's such an intense costs, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's tough to put that money
down every week or however long a year for
[SPEAKER_06]: supporting those huge, great operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's tough to find really good
organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So have you figured out anything with your
chickens to have as an alternative that
[SPEAKER_06]: will still get all the tightening and
everything like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides the worms, I think that's my my
scheme right now is to develop an idea to
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe do a fenced windrow with the
chickens in there, maybe a coop situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think really chickens, raising meat
birds, ideally you'd have a farm to market
[SPEAKER_07]: garden of some sort.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you got a lot of extra produce and
you're just tossing it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But recently I've met this local farm to
me and they raise hogs and they actually
[SPEAKER_07]: grow all their like all their own grain at
this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have invested in some of this
equipment where like they're pretty small.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're like 15 or 20 acres and
they're growing like enough grain to feed
[SPEAKER_07]: like a hundred pigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even really know how it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're organic and they're trying to
be regenerative.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think growing our grain and being
slightly mechanized is probably the
[SPEAKER_07]: answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they harvest the grain or do they just
let it let it go over and then let the
[SPEAKER_06]: chickens pre-range on the fields?
[SPEAKER_06]: They harvest and put it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they put it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not 100% sure how, but like,
yeah, there's they're really actually like
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to like learn this from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, because I actually started
raising pigs and that's kind of why I got
[SPEAKER_07]: out of raising pigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I raised American Guinea hogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're these little lard pigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're little black, cute, furry pigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they make like really, really good
meat, but they're super, super fatty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would, I would get all their feed
from a local brewery.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd just be like, dude, like fill up my
garbage can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like they were, they were just trying
to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spent barley.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spent barley, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And rye and wheat and what they're
brewing, you know, mixes of all that
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like- They're happy to give it
to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like all these waste, you know,
streams that we can take and turn into
[SPEAKER_07]: like value for our farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's like, like a real big way
to like attempt to be regenerative is to
[SPEAKER_07]: like, there's all these unsustainable
businesses out there that have excess,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, maybe they got extra.
[SPEAKER_07]: The brewery's got the grain or the
mushroom farm's got the mushroom blocks,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like that shit is gold to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, you know, maybe I worry about
like the breweries having like glyphosate
[SPEAKER_07]: all over that grain now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of also why I stopped
doing the pigs that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, you know, it's just like a
glyphosate slurry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to like beer, but I think like
closing other people's leaps is like,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like almost the easiest place for
anybody to start being regenerative.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, dude, there's so much fuckery out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like just mop up someone else's mess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like that'll just get you ahead
to where you can like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can buy jars to sell my weed because I
don't buy soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I can buy labels because I
don't buy chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't really need that much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I think you, did you have a
question behind Noble?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I just was wondering, you know,
what would you not put into your soil that
[SPEAKER_04]: a person might think about putting in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Poison oak.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, if you're breaking it down,
like I do the thermophilic thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know like some people don't like
that because you're off gassing carbon and
[SPEAKER_07]: all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're doing the thermophilic,
I'd do anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put my chicken bones in my worm bin
and that'll get thrown into the mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just put everything in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're getting those mushroom
blocks, you have to worry about pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: on them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nothing desperate and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, I think it's really
important that you're working with a
[SPEAKER_07]: certified organic at minimum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, that's that minimum.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really trust the people I work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the first season that we actually like
made a whole batch of soil, it was
[SPEAKER_07]: actually the first season we were working
on getting our Dempure certification.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Dempure certification,
you need to have clean inputs is one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the biggest things about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we actually got it pesticide tested
after we made it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it came out clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like none detected.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that was really great.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a big surprise because we
thought, you know, but if you're going
[SPEAKER_07]: into some outfit you don't know,
like my friend owns a mushroom farm too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know he's passionate and he has
really good values.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, it's just a great fit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I saved him a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saved him six hours a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like it's a serious thing all
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they love me coming to the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm the most consistent person too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the other people come and get
mushroom blocks, but like I'm always,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I'm always there every week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes it takes consistency to do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I live out a little bit out of town,
you know, like 45 minutes out of town.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like my once a week, I get to
drive to town and go shopping.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, I'm already needing to do
that shit anyways and fold it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you harvest mushrooms coming out of
your bed or the blocks are still pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: prolific?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mushroom blocks are the shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're they're fucking gold, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you pile them up and then you take
them off the mushroom farm and like
[SPEAKER_07]: they're trying to hit their numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have stuff coming out of the
incubation room that needs to go on the
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just a, it's just a timing game.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's so much life left in the
mushroom block.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, it's just full.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like if it rains, like in the
shoulder seasons, uh, the mushroom block
[SPEAKER_07]: piles, like the collection piles will just
be full.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like my, my crew, like my staff will just
go out and harvest mushrooms and we all
[SPEAKER_07]: eat good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like none of us are eating shiitake or
oysters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's buying that, that stuff,
you know, this time of year, especially
[SPEAKER_07]: it's getting a little cold now,
but we just had like some good flushes and
[SPEAKER_07]: spring time is really, really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I mean, mushroom blocks,
they're fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I fill in like, you know,
ruts or something in the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's like oyster mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, if anybody's check, check out my
Instagram or maybe if you haven't,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe check it out after this,
there's like, I had like low spots in my
[SPEAKER_07]: garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I had like mounted beds and I was
like tripping and slipping in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I just want it to be a little
more flat in the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, and I just filled it with
mushroom blocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that, that year it was just like,
like huge, like oysters everywhere coming
[SPEAKER_07]: up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're just fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I see people like cut a
hole in the oyster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it you that Joey that cut a hole on a
block and like put soil on there and grew
[SPEAKER_07]: a plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oyster blocks are silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, mushrooms are like, uh,
they're, they're fun beings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, yeah, dude, if you guys get moist
mushroom blocks, dude, that's mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But wood chips are the shit too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's gold for soil building.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, good, you know, find a good
organic dairy, like to get your cow
[SPEAKER_07]: manure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cows are, I think like Nick said to me
from Greensboro's gardens, told me that
[SPEAKER_07]: like they're the original Korean natural
farmer, the cow, you know, cause they have
[SPEAKER_07]: like this amazing gut that the rumen and,
um, it's just like ferment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know you put grass in a bucket of
water?
[SPEAKER_07]: It just smells like cow shit in like a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even that complicated,
but yeah, that's, that's what's up with my
[SPEAKER_07]: farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just like make our own soil with
mushroom blocks and hay and manure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it works out really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just do it early is the biggest
advice I'd give people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like just you'll have a lot better success
if you don't, you know, push, push it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was trying to run a rec farm,
keeping flour on the shelf all season
[SPEAKER_07]: long, which is what I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have done for seven years,
like not, I've never like, I guess it'd be
[SPEAKER_07]: nice to run out of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that'd be actually pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sell all your weed, but, uh,
you know, making our own soil out of
[SPEAKER_07]: mushroom blocks and fucking hay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, I'm stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a rewarding thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think like, it's kind of,
it's a little mystical, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody just realizing potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a hard, hard thing to get away
from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Has anybody here like gotten away from
potting soil by chance?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's, what's, what's your stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we made our own soil for all of
our beds, uh, our farm over in
[SPEAKER_06]: Leytonville.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we had a lot of big bio storages that
we've been keeping on the property.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, a lot of logs that we had buried with
top soil that had sat for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We ended up making Google beds with,
um, we did bring in rice holes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then we had wood chips from like
local tree cutting, different things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just a lot of cover crops and
chopping and dropping and, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, a lot of lawmen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Different goat manure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had chickens, we had turkeys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, a lot of local inputs and
whatnot, just whatever we're able to
[SPEAKER_06]: gather on the land.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it cost us next.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and then, uh, some, actually some old
soil we cleaned up off of a clean up from
[SPEAKER_06]: the organic garden that we, uh,
integrated into it as, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty basic, you know, completed soil,
but it was lava rock and pumice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like what you had, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a bunch of, you know,
burnt wood and stuff like that that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: make biocharring too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, yeah, just whatever we're going
to pull together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, after a couple of years,
it was the most light, fluffy,
[SPEAKER_06]: consistently moist soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it cost us next to nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I think when I tell people,
like I make my own potting, so a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: people are like, wow, what do you use for
aeration?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're surprised they don't use
perlite or like gravel or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, yeah, I'm not suggesting
somebody go run like their full rec indoor
[SPEAKER_07]: on like wood chips off the ground and
make, you know, do the same thing I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying like make your potting soil for
your outdoor farm and plant your plants in
[SPEAKER_07]: the ground or your beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like, I'm really into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like the thing about the no aeration
is that, yeah, it's not like growing in
[SPEAKER_07]: potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be careful not to overwater,
especially, um, especially early in the
[SPEAKER_07]: colder times of the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and you'll, if you don't have like,
if you didn't let your soil fully cook or
[SPEAKER_07]: fully like, you know, let the worms go
through it and it's done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll know, be like, you'll know it's
done because it kind of gets to a certain
[SPEAKER_07]: size and it stops getting smaller pretty
much at the, at the very end of like
[SPEAKER_07]: heated up a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: You turned it a couple of times,
you sifted it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you got to let it like really
like sit there in a pile and like,
[SPEAKER_07]: it'll just kind of almost shrink because
you kind of aerated it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks bigger than it is with that
sifting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll kind of go down.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't like really let it sit,
you'll, you'll find that your plants will
[SPEAKER_07]: probably do great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, my plants do great, but,
um, as you're like, by the time you
[SPEAKER_07]: transplant your plant, like your half
gallon pot, it'll go from like this much
[SPEAKER_07]: soil, like the pots about that big.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be like a little muffin,
like a little like, it'll be almost like,
[SPEAKER_07]: like two thirds the size.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll, it'll just compress a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just having your soil done early,
like I'm trying to get a year ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I already have my pile almost collected
for next year right now is kind of the
[SPEAKER_07]: cycle I'm on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and that's, that's the hard part
is like being really dedicated to it for
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you just have to be, it's like,
you have to be dedicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's like a couple of years I got
planned out and I'm already executing six
[SPEAKER_07]: months ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started executing like the picking up
that pile.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a long game, but that's like,
that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you like successfully improve
your land and close your loops is like
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking like, what do I, what am I going
to be, what am I going to be doing in like
[SPEAKER_07]: two years?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for this soil?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm like two, in two years,
I'll be trying to get two years ahead on
[SPEAKER_07]: my soil pile.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anybody else has any
questions, but I think we're about to like
[SPEAKER_07]: get into some tunes or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody, anybody not, anybody not using
potting soil for the nursery work?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you do some sifting and get after
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been definitely getting away from it
a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like where I'm just like every time that
I'm planting anything or getting more
[SPEAKER_04]: dirt, I'm mixing in like native soil or
like whatever I'm sweeping up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaves are buffer needles or I was like
putting wood chips in with the rabbit and
[SPEAKER_04]: taking the rabbit pods and wood chips and
mixing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight in with the soil with my compost,
mixing the native soil into my compost.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like diluting down the potting soil as
much as I can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like maybe starting with like
initially starting with like some potting
[SPEAKER_07]: soil you ran, like that's gold right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody has potting soil, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really, especially around here in
the triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got organic potting soil?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it's hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to like, you got to really trust
a farmer depending on what materials
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like what are they, what have
they been spraying on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's really important to know,
but man, it's gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like potting soil, like pots, like if you
could pick up pots of potting soil from
[SPEAKER_07]: like some cool, like Alpenglow farm,
I'd be like all over that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that they would sell that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's some like good organic
potter farms around here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Joey, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's next on the?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We loving it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm, I'm a little out of fuel,
but like, what do you guys want to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody got questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see happening in the rec
market up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the future for Washington?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what's, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, the regenerative farmer, I think it's
like, you know, consolidation has hit
[SPEAKER_07]: Washington pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the whole West coast,
it's, it's almost the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like they decided to like screw all
the small farmers over in like slightly
[SPEAKER_07]: different ways all over now, especially in
the West coast here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you guys got distro issues here and,
and Cali and like, and Washington,
[SPEAKER_07]: like there's just not enough stores to
sell our herb.
[SPEAKER_07]: So most of the farm, I mean, there's not a
lot of farms that are trying to do
[SPEAKER_07]: regenerative stuff in Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, they're kind of dropping like
flies and people that were in the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just like everybody's dropping like
flies, like no matter what you're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: right now, personally, like I'm waiting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like every year I'm like, am I going
to do that again?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it appears like the price drops and
the retail price always stays the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and that's just hard to like face
every, every year over and over again,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just a grind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and I, you know, I want to educate
the consumer about like why regenerative,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, sun grown, like pesticide free
cannabis is like so much better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like grown from seed, like bred by the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, so single source,
like making the freaking potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I want, I want the consumer to,
to, to appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just feel like the market's not
really there yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at all, I think it's like five to 10
years away from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like seriously, like Nick from
green source garden and, and Josh and
[SPEAKER_07]: Kelly from dragon flyers medicine are
literally maybe the only people really
[SPEAKER_07]: pushing for that in a real, real way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm not, they're not the only people,
but like they're, they're pushing for it
[SPEAKER_07]: the most.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like they're educating people and
really like getting the message out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not the only people at all,
but I think we're just waiting for like
[SPEAKER_07]: federal changes on like banking and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I can't own my farm because I can't
get a mortgage, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't have a quarter million dollars
in my pocket or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm making, I'm trying to make soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you got a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, like,
I like the idea of like the idea of the
[SPEAKER_03]: building where you start realizing that
maybe this is the time to build the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you kind of run into with that
wrecking this great idea of, I just lost
[SPEAKER_03]: it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all just smoked a hookah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you worried about the FDA getting
involved?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I'm like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I just want like something to
change so I could get like an operating
[SPEAKER_07]: loan almost for my business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like to just be treated like a normal
business to where like, if we're like
[SPEAKER_07]: struggling, I could get a loan to like pay
my staff just so I don't have to fire
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like the second you think,
like I think I'm getting somewhere like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, sales are good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, then you got two months of bad
sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, it's just, that's how the wreck
market's been for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't been like, like I got my wreck
license.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, energy, full blast, social
media.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then over the years, I'm just like,
man, I still love, I love the work,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's just the more, it's, it's just
hard to like yell that from the rooftop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they just want cheap ounces
because I'm outdoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, this isn't cheap ounces,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, this is like some, this is better
than like all the weed on the shelf here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, this is a lot of love put into it
and it's unique.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we don't, I don't grow
necessarily like what's hot on the market
[SPEAKER_07]: or like, I don't grow GMO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm growing something me and my
friends bred, you know, like something
[SPEAKER_07]: Brandon bred or Joey bred or Tamara.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, like we have very,
very unique strains and like, it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's, it's hard to, it's hard to be looked
at on this wreck market as just outdoor or
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how the Washington market has
just, it's just that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Washington's always been really indoor
hungry.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the medical days, it was just ravenous
for indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to almost say like the
person who's like looking down the line,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you're saying our quality is a little
more hesitant to just like, be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's the way you need to take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, kind of like what Joey said the
other day about like, take everything
[SPEAKER_03]: we're saying with a grain of salt because
it might be different in your world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think because of that little bit of
hesitation to like say, Hey, this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: way or whatever what you see out there,
like a lot with the internet and YouTube
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff nowadays is like tons of people
just projecting so much more multitude of
[SPEAKER_03]: information that they're like certain this
is it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I feel like the disconnect
of the educated consumer is kind of what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at is that they're,
they're getting barraged with tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: information that like at one or two or a
handful of videos that are along this
[SPEAKER_03]: line, because it's like they're all,
all the people doing old videos are also
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to do the work, you know,
and then, and then do the video at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time, you know, whereas everybody
else just like blasting it with like,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's how I'm just trying to make the
buck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's a lot of noise out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like sorting through all that noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's always, it kind of reminds me
of like back in the day, like going on to
[SPEAKER_07]: like forums, like I was on whatever,
like IC mag or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's just so much shit to get
through before you get to like the real
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff and the normal consumers,
like that's where they're at.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, there's just too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's so much dank that has no
heart out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a hard thing as like a farmer
that farms with a lot of heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I put dank out there, it's like
sitting next to dank with no heart and
[SPEAKER_07]: like in Washington, nobody gets to smell
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then like, nobody gets to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a kind of a heart crushing
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, God, I don't, I don't even want to
get onto like, you know, the depression.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of just the, the cannabis farmer in
general.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, it's been ground down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, I think it's, I think people
just should do black market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like as somebody that's been in
the rec market for, I've had seven years,
[SPEAKER_07]: my rec license.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like, I love, I love like my farm
and I love what I'm doing, but like,
[SPEAKER_07]: if someone's getting into this right now,
I'm like, dude, just represent yourself
[SPEAKER_07]: and be your true self.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be your true authentic self.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't need to be like licensed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may, you know, protection's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a medical permit, I totally suggest
people carry, you know, but like more and
[SPEAKER_07]: more like, there's just like not,
there's not a lot in it for the small
[SPEAKER_07]: family farm in the rec market with the
consolidation that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there's a select few that are
able to somehow navigate it, but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: through a lot of sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, it's, it's hard for that,
for us to do it forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping for like federal legalization,
like banks can like, I could actually like
[SPEAKER_07]: get a mortgage on my farm and I could
maybe get an operation, operating loan,
[SPEAKER_07]: get some more greenhouses, make it a
little, my life a little easier or
[SPEAKER_07]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably wouldn't actually get more
greenhouses, but you know, kitchen or
[SPEAKER_07]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really appreciate that thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like, as we're watching this
industry fall like that, as long as you're
[SPEAKER_03]: able to maintain through it and keep
focused on your like mission in the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of a sudden there's going to be a
shortage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hit a shortage here at some
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if your quality is still there,
you're at least on the top end of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If six companies are making all the weed
in California at that moment is the moment
[SPEAKER_07]: where small farmers might start doing
better, you know, like, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be so hard getting to that moment for all
of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it happened in the brewing industry,
you know, there was like a big micro brew
[SPEAKER_07]: boom and everybody's just drank the shoots
and then like it went away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, now in Bellingham where I'm from,
there's like 20 breweries.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the hay day of brewery brewing
is going on right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I see the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, we're going to get ground
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be like a couple of
people that make it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I don't know, I don't know,
like, like who wants to be the just
[SPEAKER_07]: shoots?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's not the, that's not where my
values are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so I'm just trying to like,
just make the soil, keep selling this
[SPEAKER_07]: flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a good season this year and I was
just surprised because it was just a
[SPEAKER_07]: really hard year in spring, especially.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I feel like something's driving
me to just keep doing it, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but yeah, man, the market's hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope everybody's like holding on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, you know, I got solidarity with
anybody, check the holding on a bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: herb right now on their shelves for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But hash is really big.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I see everybody kind of running
into the hash market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about California,
but in Washington, it's like, I'm doing
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just, I just built a little
washroom and that's my plan is people
[SPEAKER_07]: don't judge resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they judge flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not outdoor versus indoor with resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it fire?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it not fire?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a, that's the
potential.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the best shot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually a lot of small farms have,
especially in places where like indoor is
[SPEAKER_07]: just heavily consumed and like,
the stores want indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, that's, I feel like people have
been taught to judge it that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like in the visual market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of the Sativa Indica thing where
people are like, if there's a few of those
[SPEAKER_03]: in Indica, you realize that means actually
skinny leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can care about the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what do you, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've been taught that that's what
they should be asking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's endlessly frustrating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the, the idea of the visual market,
like we, it's important for sure to have
[SPEAKER_07]: something that's visually pleasing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like something that we want to eat or put
into our body that looks like,
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that's juicy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like give me that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's a steak or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but yeah, like that's literally all
the Washington market is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I have to sell my stuff
prepackaged and like, no, nobody even does
[SPEAKER_07]: sniff jars anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when I started rec, like you'd sell
some weed and they'd be like, send a sniff
[SPEAKER_07]: jar with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at this point, like we're like 10
years into legalization in Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we don't, nobody gets, no,
we don't even fucking do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of wonder why I don't see that
more in Washington when I'm up there as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just like, so you can't open the
package.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then like, why can't you list what it
should, like if people understood the
[SPEAKER_03]: turkey breakdown, what flavor profile they
might be hitting off the turkeys,
[SPEAKER_03]: then at least you could show the consumer
like, well, here's what it, here's the
[SPEAKER_03]: turkey breakdown of it on the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they, they haven't even gone down that
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, no, you just have to
guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you know this string.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually in Washington, you know,
I, I am able to put my turps on there on
[SPEAKER_07]: my packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody does something different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's actually, it is cool in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can brand our own stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I have my brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Eagle trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my farm name.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and my sister, you know, run and yeah,
we like jarred up and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we put our like top, we take like the
top, like five turps and we put that on
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, we kind of art it up,
artsy it up a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: make it nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look in so that people know like,
oh, this is an Oseman or the summer scene
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of dominant, just put the dominant
troops on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't put like the whole test,
but a lot of fun, a lot of places now,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if in Cali, I'm sure they're
doing this, but they do like a QR code and
[SPEAKER_07]: it'll take, and that'll take you to the
test.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can purchase that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, that's why I get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that in other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like, are you sure that's really
what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or does somebody just tell you that?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, it's all in the honor
system in the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like my whole farm is cambered
out, like in Washington, we're required to
[SPEAKER_07]: have like every square inch cambered out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the end, it's all, it's all on your
honor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, it's frustrating from the
perspective of someone who is like trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to play by the rules and that are set for
seeing how much of it is on the honor
[SPEAKER_07]: system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the same time, not wanting more
regulation, but knowing the bad actors can
[SPEAKER_07]: do so much, you know, they're just so,
so, I mean, God damn like so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I kind of went down the lines of
like, what if that QR code just took you
[SPEAKER_03]: to a website that was more along the lines
of what to look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask this guy about this, about the card,
ask him about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they're going to scan the QR code.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of you just directed their
knowledge in a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of my thought with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's all about like what the bud tender
knows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like really in the end, like, so from like
the farmer's perspective, like from,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, I think we just need to be really
transparent and almost like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_07]: what else you do besides like,
you got to have the bud tenders come to
[SPEAKER_07]: like your farm, you know, like that's what
I literally do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have like every summer, this summer,
I didn't do it just cause like,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was a rough year, but I usually do like
a summer, a bud tender party.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have like all the bud tenders from
all my accounts and the, I just invite
[SPEAKER_07]: their whole staff and we put on this party
and like, you know, it costs the money to
[SPEAKER_07]: put the party on, like, you know,
have some food and like, it's rent some
[SPEAKER_07]: tents and some chairs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we get to have like 50 bud
tenders come through like three times
[SPEAKER_07]: during the day and like see what we're
doing and then get the whole rundown and
[SPEAKER_07]: answer every question.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, yeah, to have them know what
the, what the fuck's going on at the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, if you don't have them at
your farm, they won't know shit about your
[SPEAKER_07]: farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's, yeah, that's, it's important,
especially to stand out because when they
[SPEAKER_07]: go to like a big rec farm for a,
like a huge, like, you know, corporatized
[SPEAKER_07]: rec farm, it's going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they're like walking through the
fields and they're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, this is like runs and this is
GMO.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you take them through your field
and you're like, Oh, this is my,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is my Rolex F5.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been breeding this here on this land
for four years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been making all the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like literally meant to grow here and
it grows here super well now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, there's just so much more of a
story to tell.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, all of a sudden you're like,
you're not growing mids, you're growing
[SPEAKER_07]: that fine wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you want them to, to know you're,
you're putting something out there that's
[SPEAKER_07]: actually special and not just like,
yeah, not a mids factory.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think having people out to the
farm is the shit like buyers, like don't
[SPEAKER_07]: be smoking mirrors, like have them out and
show them what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, be real, like, you know,
maybe you clean the place up, but you're
[SPEAKER_07]: walking by something like, yeah,
maybe you're like, yeah, that doesn't look
[SPEAKER_07]: as good as I want it to look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Modesty goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people like appreciate when you
want to do better, you know, as a farmer,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like a lot of the farms are just
real brod out and like you got these
[SPEAKER_07]: numbers and like, full on canopy,
like, like perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the end, they're just got all these
dirty little secrets.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're spraying a lot of pesticides and
they're like, they got russet mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's just been like a war.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, like at least if you're
having a war, like maybe you have the
[SPEAKER_07]: blood tendrils out and be like,
yeah, we had this war, we sprayed JMS and
[SPEAKER_07]: like, we made it with the mint in the
garden here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is how we did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's just so much more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like palatable, the small farm aspect,
you win every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think the small farmer has the
option of like hiding anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like that's where I came from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was hiding in a basement,
growing indoor is kind of where I came
[SPEAKER_07]: from.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, it's hard to come out of that
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it also creates this sense of
community, like you're saying about
[SPEAKER_03]: educating your blood tenders and the
people and like drawing them into feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: like they're part of this family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas like, you know, like if they're
out going to any other dispensary to them,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, unless somebody's really tying
them into it, it's just like going to
[SPEAKER_03]: Walmart or a 7-Eleven, you know,
like what to them seems like some big box
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so by doing what you're saying,
having a summer party and bringing them
[SPEAKER_03]: into it and letting them know deep
knowledge like that allows them to feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like they're a part of something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And not even just like the blood tenders,
but also consumers and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the amount of people you bring into
it and give them that deep knowledge,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think builds into like the community
aspect of a web of resource aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of the time, a lot of the
consumers are going in and they're just
[SPEAKER_05]: like, what's the highest THC content?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem with that is that the
blood tender will answer them rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: be like, is THC really what you're looking
for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe try to redirect that question.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the same conversation like every
dispensary or every weed store is having
[SPEAKER_07]: too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they know this, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's like, it's not that they
don't know that, but it's just the case,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: People walk through those doors every day
and say, what's cheap and what's the most
[SPEAKER_07]: potent?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what's the best and what's the
cheapest?
And how much did I get?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And volume and like, that's just the way
it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think like in my mind,
I'm like, I can't fight the indoor outdoor
[SPEAKER_07]: thing forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the resin, show them with the resin,
you know, show them like your outdoor sun
[SPEAKER_07]: grown resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fire, it's like just impossible to
beat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, show them your farm,
you know, I think that's like a huge
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like show them what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's just interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we nerd the fuck out on all this
like, this like, this shit and like,
[SPEAKER_07]: we might be self conscious about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, the bud tenders come out and
they're a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but anybody could be a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of like young folks that
really want to be growers and they want to
[SPEAKER_07]: learn how to like, there's a lot of people
that want to learn how to grow that start
[SPEAKER_07]: their first job as a bud tender,
like, and they're super fascinated and
[SPEAKER_07]: they want to like, they just eat up the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like you're giving them an opportunity
and the access is a really big thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, yeah, like I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like vendor days, sometimes I haven't done
that much since COVID.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, vendor days are cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you set up and you just table,
you know, somewhere like here,
[SPEAKER_07]: like fucking Pushkirk or these guys are
doing vendor day here, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you really get to meet people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, that face to face like is
really, is really special.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I have this guy who's worked,
oh, he's not even working for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he is actually, I think he is now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's working like two days a week for
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trimming now, but he, he just came up to
me one day at a vendor day and he's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: dude, I'm a big fan of the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm growing weed in the forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm going to college and like I'm out
in the boonies growing weed and asking all
[SPEAKER_07]: these questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, he's like, would you want to
like trade seeds?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we like traded up and like,
and now he's renting space.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not even renting space for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just letting him like use a little
spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call him my apprentice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he like, just this really nice mutual
thing where like, like a lot of times this
[SPEAKER_07]: year, like I, I needed labor, but maybe I
couldn't afford it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like farming on the property and
he's like, he's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a hand to help me, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's just like being, you just meet
people by boothing, like just set up a
[SPEAKER_07]: table and sell your stuff or like you
can't sell your stuff feeling stickers or
[SPEAKER_07]: something, you know, so powerful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm always giving people seeds too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like tomorrow I'll probably be passing out
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just the best, it's the best way
to make a connection is to like,
[SPEAKER_07]: either sell or trade seeds with somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there's this like interaction and
like, if I sell you seeds or give you
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds, like I'm in your life for a minimum
of like, you know, five months or four
[SPEAKER_07]: months.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's just a connection there
that's really powerful and do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got anything else, Joey?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk about your hash real quick?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm making some hash lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do a lot of stuff with like Royal Kush
and it's not even like a very like good
[SPEAKER_07]: yielder.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of special.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it's good, like decently
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made some hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made some melt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made some like, this year I grew a bunch
of Kushkirk stuff is just the shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody knows like he grows good hash
varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I brought some BMG sour garlic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a real sour, decently hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very dank.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll dab that out if anybody's
interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I brought Royal Sour, some Royal
Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody want some grams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Dempere farm like, and yeah,
you got to talk to Josh and Kelly,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like, that's the first step is
like, talk to them and like, be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm interested in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get, you get plugged into like
events like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really making your soil, like making
compost, I think is like the biggest thing
[SPEAKER_07]: you can do because it's the most like
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, making making your own potting
soil is a huge step.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, get get away from that store about
potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a good step.
[SPEAKER_07]: But just finding like, cool ways to close
loops on your own, you know, thing like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like, I know Alex here is like
doing like a Hugo culture bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's making his own resonance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that's like, just living it being
that that dude, like, kushkuri.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what kushkuri told me the other
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, be yeah, you got to be the guy
that that's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to be the guy you want to be and
like embody that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to be a Dempere farmer,
you just have to embody it and build a
[SPEAKER_07]: Hugo culture, start raising a couple
animals to make your nitrogen or start
[SPEAKER_07]: closing loops for the mushroom farm that's
local to your tree service or something
[SPEAKER_07]: like get on a chip drop whatever.com and
like, make your spot a drop and just start
[SPEAKER_07]: like pumping out soil and just like,
just make regenerative cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I think that's the best get in
contact with us like the whole Dem fam,
[SPEAKER_07]: like there's so many farmers like,
just being in contact and like asking
[SPEAKER_07]: questions that almost everybody's really
like, pretty friendly, I think,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and like willing to,
you know, engage if you're engaging,
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like and but I think, like from a
very like baseline perspective,
[SPEAKER_07]: questioning and being skeptical of the
inputs we use is like, is just super
[SPEAKER_07]: important, you know, like, you can't just
trust the mushroom farm that it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be clean, you might like need a pesticide
test that that soil, like sometimes you
[SPEAKER_07]: got to go a little extra far, like I don't
pesticide test that soil every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I might pesticide test it next year,
because it's been like a year or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so just going to extra step in
like caring and knowing like, kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to be aware that there's like a
level of contamination in this world that
[SPEAKER_07]: is almost impossible to avoid,
but that we should be striving to avoid
[SPEAKER_07]: it, not just giving up in our gardens,
like, it's so easy to be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, there's glyphosate and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw up your arms, but I think it's just
wild, like, there's a huge level of
[SPEAKER_07]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's what kind of what the
Dempure idea is, just like there is
[SPEAKER_07]: contamination, make the most holistic
decisions for our bodies and our gardens,
[SPEAKER_07]: and, and be very thoughtful with what we
put into our bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it's no joke, like,
you know, you can't take anything back
[SPEAKER_07]: that you put into your body.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, then answer your question,
the best way to become a Dempure farmer,
[SPEAKER_07]: or get certified.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just embodying the Dempure farmer,
and then you then that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned in chip drop, I just want to
say, if you are, it's good to like,
[SPEAKER_06]: let those chips sit on your property for
like a year or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just be really careful because all that
chips aggregated from all over the place,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have no idea that one truck probably
like 30 different spots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, chips are chips are gamble.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's a gamble.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just recognize that there's a level of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, make the best decisions for
yourself.
Thank you.
