[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so here's the deal with
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to be an old socialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that regulation is the only
thing that keeps us from going at each
[SPEAKER_01]: other's throats like a bunch of rabid
dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulations could save us, they could also
sink us, because we don't have exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: enlightened electeds who are putting this
to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't count on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to shape it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to shape it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which brings me back to our own little
cocoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the chair of the steering committee
for Measure AF in Mendocino County last
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know about Measure AF?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I probably do, but not by name.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so in November we were going to,
it was a measure that was basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: I came out of the Mendocino Cannabis
Policy Council, many activists in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community since June of 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the language of the MCRSA,
the medical bill that was signed into law
[SPEAKER_01]: in October 2015, and we adopted it to
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who were opposed to us leading
that, because we came from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community, did a trump on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spread lies, rumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was vicious, vicious, vicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They defeated us, although the same people
who voted against Measure AF later voted
[SPEAKER_01]: for Prop 64 for the same language.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when we try to step out of
our little cocoon and our cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community sunk, tons and tons of money and
energy into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for many, I mean, I can't overstate
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come out of an activist background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved in the world for a long
time, but these folks came up to these
[SPEAKER_01]: hills to get away from all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not interested in government.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hate government.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cynical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They barely vote, a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean most of them, but a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're completely disillusioned,
disenchanted and cynical about anything to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with regulation, government,
elected officials, any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very cynical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we managed to mobilize this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rightfully so, but it doesn't serve
any purpose to, you know, we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as you know, I like Tom Hartman,
what he always says at the end of his
[SPEAKER_01]: show, democracy is not a spectator sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you step back and don't be involved,
then don't even complain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can get in there and take charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are the elephant in the room in
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've run the economy for how long?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since we lost lumber, fishing,
all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew we had clout, but nobody wanted
to talk about the elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we had something as public as
Measure AF forcing those of us who had
[SPEAKER_01]: never done it before, I mean, I had,
but lots of people in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community to come talk to the Rotarians,
talk to the Chamber of Commerce,
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to, go to the Mendocino College panel
and be an alpha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just there and talk about, show that
you're a normal human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have horns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not part of the Mexican mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have children that go to school with
other people's children.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy real estate, you buy cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are normal people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to normalize the whole image of the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, our own worst enemy was
internal to the cannabis community because
[SPEAKER_01]: we have people who have been so isolated
and so cynical for so long and delusional
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sense of they're so firmly,
strongly believed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have also firmly, strongly believed in
the magic and the potency and the beauty
[SPEAKER_01]: of this herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a part of our culture for so
long, wrapped up in music and three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four generations of family growers and
crafting the best cannabis in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: creating the best medicines in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were so full of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm one of those people that we had no
idea that the rest of the world was so
[SPEAKER_01]: against us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then stepping forward and trying to
really get engaged, whoa, we were slapped
[SPEAKER_01]: around and everybody ran back up to the
hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens if you get engaged with
civic society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, told you so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't have a civic civil society when
that's the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only path.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have four paths now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about this all the time in
Mendocino amongst all the people who come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and bring their beautiful craft
cannabis into Dragonfly to sell it to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw the towel in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one guy, he's been a top shelf
producer for years and he's throwing the
[SPEAKER_01]: towel in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, come on, don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're such a good cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I joined a co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to try to pool my resources with
other small farmers and I gave them 12
[SPEAKER_01]: units to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The co-op was, we're going to market this
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get this out of them,
but we're going to take care of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And four or five months later,
they called me and said, come on in and
[SPEAKER_01]: get something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get paid for my 12 units.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave him eight units back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't move.
[SPEAKER_01]: They moved four units.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't move the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the flood from Oregon and every
place else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, I can't stand this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's driving me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm throwing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one route is for people to throw the
towel in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell you how many people are
thinking of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other route is to stick with the black
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at, you got by conservative
estimates, Tom Allman, the sheriff's
[SPEAKER_01]: estimates in Mendocino County,
over 9,000 cultivators in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had around 600 people apply for a
cultivation permit in the county so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've issued one or two permits,
depending on, two now?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've issued two permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, big whoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, why should I get involved
in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick with the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we know that's a dead end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a dead end.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black market is not going to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your third option?
[SPEAKER_01]: Join a co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't have the resources,
the wherewithal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know, is it an LLC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it an S-corp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have to get a lawyer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are without... Yeah,
all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fourth thing is find somebody
who will come and give you investment
[SPEAKER_01]: money so you can scale up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find your private VC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me tell you, few far between and
they're not looking at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what's the endemic nature of a
green rush?
[SPEAKER_01]: A green rush, and I got this when I went
to Las Vegas for one of the big business
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was standing behind a guy with a big 10
gallon hat with this big Texas drawl.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was standing in line to register it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, hey, you here from Texas?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, yeah, I want to learn all about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the Texas cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you coming from the Texas cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, no, I'm from oil and gas,
but I see where the money's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got all these people jumping into a
green rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make huge volume crap,
make crap pot, mediocre products,
[SPEAKER_01]: make a lot of money and get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the nature of a green rush or a
gold rush or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does not include investing in these
small entrepreneurs, manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers and supporting them to create,
to keep the intellectual property the
[SPEAKER_01]: heritage, the traditions, the family craft
that we've developed for all these
[SPEAKER_01]: decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to lose all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a tremendous loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tremendous loss to all of us,
to the whole country, to the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's no finer cannabis in the
world, no finer medicines in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I'm not just using hyperbole
then in Northern California because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that interesting confluence of sun and
virgin soil, TPZ land and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to lose it all,
I'm afraid, because those VC, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those people aren't going to pay
their taxes anyway because the taxes
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't up to what they're going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they look at, I mean,
I just did the math on a napkin the other
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did math on a napkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Napkin math is pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the prices that are happening right
now and we're being told as sources that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get from other places, it's not,
it doesn't include any labor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just from a dispensary point of
view, you know, last Monday I had to give
[SPEAKER_01]: the county $4,400.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't pay my house note.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to lay staff off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, you know, nobody's going to stay
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typical of, that's how business
comes in and, you know, stars the little
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So little guys do have to join together,
figure out a way to join together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this market is, is a good
source of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This and all the markets that we have in
Mendocino, we have another one up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino village every once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a farmer's market and it's,
it creates community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I find in talking to all of these
farmers is they feel so good coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: these markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't sell very much, but meeting
with each other, building ties,
[SPEAKER_01]: creating community.
[SPEAKER_01]: That what I'm hearing them say is all of
these incredibly glowing, idealistic,
[SPEAKER_01]: utopian ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if we could just all be together and
support each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all these abstractions and they
really don't have a clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a clue how rough and mean
the venture capital world is, or in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with politicians who are just
going to bow, lean over and get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: butt by, you know, I mean, they just don't
have a clue in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so many people in the cannabis
community are incredibly, they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated for so long and they really are
not skilled or tooled up to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate sounding so pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, yeah, it's really, it breaks my
heart to see these people espousing a
[SPEAKER_01]: track that they're going to take that I
know I'm listening to and I go,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't possibly do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a heartbreak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one thing that does work really
well when you have this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: communication is people can begin,
well, it's like what I was telling Chris,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you've got that opportunity to have a
robust and challenging dialogue in our
[SPEAKER_01]: community, let's do that instead of,
I mean, I can't tell you for two days,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like hearing, oh man,
I got the best high off of this pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just goes on and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to drop the stoner culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to just drop some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it for your private social life on
Saturday night with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it dominates the dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, yeah, it's really,
it's really, it's just, it's just,
yeah, it's really,
it's really important.
