[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with them is that they do
phenomenal selection based off of vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: and resistance and quality of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your numerics are under 17%,
that shit doesn't move at a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I look for very
disproportionate ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look for 300, 400 to 1 THC to CBD
ratios with 5% to 7% in early veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take those males and I find
them in clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take that cluster, then I
subsequently flower it to see floral
[SPEAKER_00]: formation, turf profile, resin
development, overall vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I throw it into situations where
I can test the resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I have that, now I have a breeder
male that I can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I throw it on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get the numbers to skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I provide those males to other
breeders in other parts of the country in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this way, what it does,
it lets me do this hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can send it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use their facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has much larger potential for
multi-thousand plant sifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can then get the cultivar back
that's been sifted from these massive
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I get these outlier cultivars that
were bred using the outlier males I find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's easier for me to chase it in
juvenile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use sex testing, same thing,
I use phyllis to sex test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what it does is it used to take me
twice the vegetative space to do all this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as soon as I have my first coital
lead and I get my first true leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can then take a sample, stick it in a
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little 88 tube sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be punch cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's in 88 tube sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send it to phyllis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three days later, I get the results back
and it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've never had an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been probably 150, 200,000 seeds
done like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've never had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't indicate intersex situation
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex is still going to be based off of
how much of the female chromosome remains
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we can get that haploid,
as soon as we can get into a double
[SPEAKER_00]: haploid where we're going only into the
female we can then remove that intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress the little shit out of it,
it's only going to be a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you have them though in your
life as a cultivator, you have plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you consider bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is a lot of them aren't
these poly hybrids you're playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: right now where we're mixing, we're taking
skittle and purple punch and forbidden
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and wedding cake and we're swirling
that shit up and we pull out some sexy
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is you have so much gender
and material movement that you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea what's really inside it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just know that the quality of the end
product is desirable, but it also has
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic prone tendencies and anything
to do with cookie lines is what we find
[SPEAKER_00]: from breeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie lines and skittle lines has an
incredible intersex situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two different skittle hybrids
that it costs 40 grand in work and two
[SPEAKER_00]: years in testing, but they both won the
Oregon concentrate cup two years in a row
[SPEAKER_00]: with zero issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're absolute winners in terms of
competition quality plants, but with high
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of resistance, high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Oz Kush out of out of third
gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had the skittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I know where the skittle came
from, so I didn't get the skittle from
[SPEAKER_00]: third gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the skittle from the guys that third
gen got it from out of Visalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out of Visalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally it was out of the bay and then
it got moved to Visalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visalia is where the cut came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grabbed it from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grabbed it from them and then I held it
and then I released it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a sherbet cut from
Sherbinski that uses the skittle as the as
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my my sherbet cut is like they call
the Green Hulk because it has that rich
[SPEAKER_00]: skittle like flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you blow it into a concentrate,
it's phenomenal, but it's a stunning
[SPEAKER_00]: flower too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Oz Kush though, because you you
have an addictive response to all
[SPEAKER_00]: basically limonene terpenes and so tobacco
companies did research on what's the most
[SPEAKER_00]: addictive terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find that it's lemon limes,
oranges, pink grapefruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most addictive response to
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see people dabbing heavy on
the fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why all of a sudden is there this
incredible resurgence in floral terms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the OG terms are popular because
primarily it's a it's a mere scene is a
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy anesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take mere scene and
concentrated, it's an anesthetic at a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works as an opiate transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that use opiates can use OG and
get efficacy and treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get from anything else because
not much else has enough mere scene levels
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of a sudden, everybody gets into
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because fundamentally, that's your
most addictive response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you start to take fuels which
have the anesthetic and then you mix them
[SPEAKER_00]: with florals and fruits to get that that
high mono terpene signature in limonene,
[SPEAKER_00]: lemonene, mandarines, and you put it on
them, they come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see what was my buddy call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree basers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tree basers because they can't
stop basing that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like it's for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree basing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but it drives a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my partner and I work with two
other guys that are friends of mine on a
[SPEAKER_00]: private level where they're both consider
them fantastic sifters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of them lives up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one lives over in Willets,
about, you know, 80 miles from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the guy from Willets has been in
cannabis probably maybe 55 years and a
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant legend in cannabis where no,
no, this guy's name is Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ben's at a level far different than
all these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben was a monster legend baller from the
day who can't get out of cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: he's addicted to it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all Ben does is hunt genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because he's tied into the world so
heavily, it lets him access everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because he has such a calibrated
market potential, he's unfucking
[SPEAKER_00]: believably accurate with quality of
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So old Ben, me, and this cat out of Oregon
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I can hunt and I get one new
thing a year and Ben hunts one new thing a
[SPEAKER_00]: year and my boy in Oregon hunts one new
thing a year, we have three new things in
[SPEAKER_00]: a year because basically people like,
I got something incredible, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, if it's not better than the
parental, it's not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Oz Kush is a good example of
where we had to go all the way into the F3
[SPEAKER_00]: on it to find non-intersex capability
under stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I'll do is I'll send those
cuttings in to check the level of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of female chromosome present, because we
know that under no, no circumstances does
[SPEAKER_00]: it trigger where we had to go through a
full, you know, almost 18 months of work
[SPEAKER_00]: and about 40 grand and blasting through
this to find where do we find the outlier
[SPEAKER_00]: potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with marker assisted, it just
allows you to move a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom line is that there's going
to have to be product differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I see with cannabis right now is
primarily technology that's borrowed from
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries that comes into our
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone said I'm state of the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're using technology from
other industries and it's state of the art
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, but that doesn't mean it's
state of the art because it's been used
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already in it and it's an
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're the guinea pig,
but with genomics, genomics is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of the art is going to be because
you're going to be able to go into stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's never been manipulated,
never been sifted, never been driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that, to me, that's where we really
go because once we have a genetic base,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, you can't get around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know with the human genome,
that when you have superior genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't, you can't, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're genetically programmed to be an
Elon Musk intellectually, you can read
[SPEAKER_00]: every book on earth until you die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still not going to have this
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know that that's really where
we're going to go with cannabis is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I saw this and I've been hunting
varietals for age and decades chasing
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals, but I realized that what I'm
doing is I'm chasing and I'm hunting and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're sifting and we're using,
but we could compress that period and get
[SPEAKER_00]: a more accurate situation and then start
to really develop unique product lines for
[SPEAKER_00]: the respective farms and then develop
unique lines based off a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoors ISO, we can certify it anywhere
we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do computer chips in Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do computer chips in Silicon Valley,
same chip, because we can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: variables in the facility, but that's not
the truth with glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: House and that's not the truth with
outdoor because you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to change it, but no matter
what you do, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're high desert or if you're
a Valley, you're going to have radically
[SPEAKER_00]: different situations that occur with your
production methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to get around this to me
is through genomics because what it'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: is it'll allow you to be able to reduce
infrastructure costs where it's not so
[SPEAKER_00]: imperative to have so much cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not flaring off my terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm having variability, these in my
VPD, it's okay because the vigor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants still going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm having pathogenic problems,
I should be able to have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can breed plants that have a tougher
epidural layer, cause that's what we see
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see certain plants, just like when
you're running silicone high levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get the epidural layer to toughen
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proboscis can't make it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why can't we do that on a genetic
level?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got contacted from a doctors in
Florida that had said, Hey, do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on a project with developing medical
varieties in Florida?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it was specific chemo type
profiles so they could use it for
[SPEAKER_00]: sublingual and topical patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to do it in conventional
methodology because all this genomic stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not everybody's aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're aware of it for the human element,
but not for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing was we were tying into a
Salinas operation to go test through,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hundreds of thousands of plants,
but I'm like, you're going to miss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible to pick the outlier when
you have that many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you need to be able to do is
use the genetic testing procedures to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to locate what you're seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can then take that population
and work with that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find the person that's TB
resistant and breed them, I'll get higher
[SPEAKER_00]: TB resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find someone that has higher
genetic levels, you see it in families
[SPEAKER_00]: where you see all the athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once there's a relative somewhere who
transferred some phenomenal genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: material, isolate that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reproduce that cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we want to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're about to, it's happening right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started to work with some crews
out of Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can start to work with some of the
lines out of the cookie crew because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have access through Parker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parker is partners on the lemonade line
with burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it allows us to start to take
some of these highly branded varietals
[SPEAKER_00]: that have exceptional velocity in the
market, sift through them to find the true
[SPEAKER_00]: production varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can license them into
facilities that can then sell this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a large manufacturing
facility we're building right now that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be designed for terp stripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you find is a lot of the
terpene profiles you see now, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding these companies terp sheets for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows them to take my data and put
together formulations to create
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-derived terpene packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it allows you to have crewed
manufacturers help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it lets me play with
other companies so I can understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I share my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get data back from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me keep myself moving continuously
or otherwise I would only be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can mess with enough scientists,
enough other companies, and we keep our
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary ship proprietary, but we work
on joint projects, it lets us do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit what terpene profile
you put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not the same as a cannabis derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get the complexity straight and
you can't get the ratio straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately the experience is
diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we realized was that if we put in
commercial level terp stripping
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, I can then have farmers who
have locations that are optimal for higher
[SPEAKER_00]: quality do my crude production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can have farms that have better
situations to do my terp production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull the terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the flower gets blown as
crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way you make crude money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make terp money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terps now can get infused with the
crude from others because you're having a
[SPEAKER_00]: radical amount of product that can be
created from terpene infusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it starts to let me find how do we
stabilize markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, a lot of it is that I've been
in Humboldt for almost 30 years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any intention to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I see is a tremendous number of
people that were phenomenal career
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, but they're not
technologically aware because they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't that they're not smart enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they've been very focused
on what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're biologically intelligent,
they're cultivar intelligent, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to produce using their
specific location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes them vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, what I've been doing for a
long time is I gather these hot varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get access to them through a number of
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These companies allow me to take the
varietal and push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got ahold of a cookie like nine years
ago, and I was the first one to put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into broad scale production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did was, and it was allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, you can't build a true
brand or true market if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: million people using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If only 10 of us have it and only a
thousand people consume it, that's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: real product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for years, I've been receiving
products from breeders that said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, listen, take this product from us and
move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my nursery focused primarily on
black market operations where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to come in with a driver's
license and a 215, but I influenced up to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the BOE figure that I was doing
anyway between 150 to 175 million a year
[SPEAKER_00]: in influencing the system based off of
what was occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the last five years, I might
influence the billion dollars of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production through the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders recognize that because everything
you touch blows up in other regions
[SPEAKER_00]: because I do my research over the whole
United States to find out what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take a look and then when you
would come in to speak to me, I'd say,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, and I'm not going to ratchet out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would give me the answer and
say, what's your market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be like, look, I'm moving it to
the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would find cultivars that move in
that hot direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would have sifted out cultivars
that work on the production level for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it does, it allows you as the
cultivated to have a better level of
[SPEAKER_00]: success because you can move your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lets me have plenty of people to
play with, to play the R and D game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lets me test my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I accurate with my market analysis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to figure out,
are you on point?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can, you can believe you're on
point, but when you're moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: that much material, you know you're on
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it allows you to reconfirm your
hypothesis because you have to prove it
[SPEAKER_00]: twice in order to make it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it lets me function in that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to be able to see is the
development of varietals that work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro climates of Humboldt County in these
low lying areas that have higher humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: levels that have a longer season up to
where I am up in the mountains,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I have ungodly production capacity
and quality, but with a shorter season
[SPEAKER_00]: because the temperature ranges a little
more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to mess around with
some of all the new indoor facilities that
[SPEAKER_00]: were popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed indoor people now, but we want to
say, Hey, let's get varieties that work
[SPEAKER_00]: under your lighting systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them that work under these
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What works optimally in Rockwell,
what works optimally in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start to mark those varietals that
are, that are outliers within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start to take a look at it and say,
Hey, these are the markers we see on those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can start to go through your
breeding projects, pull out the outliers,
[SPEAKER_00]: do the work, fill out the gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you really have a product
distribution that actually makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about the,
you know, and I don't want to knock any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these companies because it, I don't want
to, I don't want to shank people on tape
[SPEAKER_00]: or in, I just, I'd rather not shank you,
but it doesn't make any goddamn sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're, you're having an
opportunity to develop an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been in this forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is going on in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: since fuck the sixties, but right now it's
actually changing into this very accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have this incredible
increase in people coming in and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start having global trading
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting hit up from every country
on earth to go play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this stuff is, is at a level
that's nothing like we've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we start to develop product
lines that actually makes sense that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could own yourself license and sell to
other facilities around the world as
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what our concern is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hold your product.
