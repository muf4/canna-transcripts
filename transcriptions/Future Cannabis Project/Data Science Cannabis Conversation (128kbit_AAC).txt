[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw Amos's talk, Confident
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a fantastic job presenting a larger
data science project that Confident
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is undertaking in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard work in general to take good
data and provide key insights to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your biggest takeaway after working
with the data for so long, and what
[SPEAKER_01]: direction do you think that data is taking
shape?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kinds of good questions that you
think we should ask kind of in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the ones that keep you up at
night?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest thing that's emerged
from looking at the data is how much
[SPEAKER_00]: variation there is in the chemistry of
cannabis, not just from strain name to
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name, but within a strain name,
from producer to producer, from harvest to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, and even within a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that when you shop for
cannabis, what you really shop for is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bundle of chemicals, is a bundle of
chemistry that you think is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce an experience, that you think is
going to produce an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that the way that we
present cannabis to the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and take a market approach to these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a chemist, I'm not a biologist,
I'm more of an economist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try and take a market approach,
and it turns out that the way that we sell
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to the market, in terms of indica
sativa hybrid, in terms of what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name, what's the genetic origin of
the strain, that's probably not the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to help customers get the experience
that they're looking to get.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's interesting,
we're here in Nevada, and one of the great
[SPEAKER_00]: things that Nevada has done, really
leading the other states, is by requiring
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene testing for all of their cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're looking for a particular
terpene, you can go into the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and we've been, our team came in
from Palo Alto, and we've been going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensaries here, and just talking to
each other about how fantastic it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can tell what terpenes are in what
we're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, I just wish every state
would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of legacy cannabis
users who want that terpene information,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for years, they've been saying things
along the lines of, well, it's not just a
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily want the highest
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some additional flavor in there,
and I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemovar, or kind of the strain name
that we've seen kind of emerge,
[SPEAKER_01]: is really the fundamental branding of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you kind of go after and identify
specific strains, what you're really doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is you're kind of delving into the brand
history there, and it's a legacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a legacy subject, and I think people
identify with those early brands in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, even before the names of
companies had been generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I talked about and
mentioned in the talk, I met a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ago a fellow who ran grows in Humboldt
County in the 1970s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bumped into him by randomly in the
Philippines, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I asked him, I said, what's the
difference between an indica and a sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a grower, and you were a grower
when cannabis was first starting in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between an indica
and a sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it mercine, is it terpenaline?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, it's how high the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that kind of answers the
question, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great fundamental approach,
and if we could find kind of simple
[SPEAKER_01]: answers to help consumers on that end,
I would love to see things like that come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of your data set, and sort of the data
set emerging through all of the users at
[SPEAKER_01]: Confident Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the labs who participate in that sort
of experience should have some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible platform where they can go and
ask basic questions about their consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: where these products are coming from,
and not only that, but have sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: horsepower of good statistical analysis to
back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the wonderful things for me working
at Confident Cannabis is that they're true
[SPEAKER_00]: believers in data science and in the
importance of science itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's never been pressure to cause the
tools to produce one result or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really let the data form its own shape,
and we let the data tell us what it wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was presenting today was this tool
that we've constructed called Connect,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a way of visualizing cannabis
strains in terms of their chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: content, and we built that for a lot of
different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built it so that consumers can figure
out what it is they've been smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the chemistry was, so that they can
find, if they had an experience that they
[SPEAKER_00]: liked, they can find things nearby so they
can find new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built it so that dispensaries can have
a diverse range of products on their shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: and figure out what it means to have a
diverse, chemically diverse range of
[SPEAKER_00]: products on their shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built it for producers to figure out
where their strains fit in, to help them
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify against price movements and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to figure out ways that we
can use the data to help our customers to
[SPEAKER_00]: advance their goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying not to get ahead of our labs,
our data providers, if they want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: producing, publishing on a subject,
we're not going to research that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try and find ways to use this enormous,
wonderful data set that we've accumulated
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it in ways that help the whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, from my general perspective,
I'm a chemist, but I'm also a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer, and I have just general
questions to ask of the data set,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I thought you actually presented the
good test data set and the general
[SPEAKER_01]: approach and questions that you've asked
to answering broader questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, what kind of selectivity
differences do we have across the space to
[SPEAKER_01]: uniquely identify the plants that we all
care about and love?
[SPEAKER_01]: From my perspective, I think you're
providing a tool that helps all businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent a large investment firm across
the space, C21 Investments, who's acquired
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from grows to dispensaries and
all the things in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a processor perspective, we're always
looking at the frontier of Canvas,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we want to know how the market is not
only evolving, but the product evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to back that with good science and
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we put a product out, we want it to
be something that not only consumers have
[SPEAKER_01]: asked for, but give them something maybe
new to the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to use data to guide those
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: If terpenes are really not uniquely
identifying a plant, but it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: experience customers are asking for,
I think that's perfect information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of information that we
love to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good simplifications like that from these
larger data sets, very small conclusions,
[SPEAKER_01]: can lead to very strong strategic
decisions on our end.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions I tried to answer
early on was, can we build a model for
[SPEAKER_00]: predicting the strain based on the sample
data?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer was no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is that there are so many
different products sold under the same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names that the data doesn't
differentiate between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some strains where you can
differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the strains that are in common use,
the Blue Dreams, the Jack Harriers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sour Diesels, the Girl Scout Cookies
of the world, there are so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: products sold under that name that there
is not a statistically valid way of
[SPEAKER_00]: assigning a plant to one of those
categories or another based on their lab
[SPEAKER_00]: test data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing as how you're building this larger
platform for integrating all manner of
[SPEAKER_01]: data sets to ask questions about from a
larger perspective, what kinds of data
[SPEAKER_01]: sets would you like to see integrated in
the future and what could businesses do to
[SPEAKER_01]: help enable that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be as simple as adding surveys to
the space or collecting more public health
[SPEAKER_01]: type information to policy type
integration to get an understanding of how
[SPEAKER_01]: product is flowing across the larger
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to be integrated in three
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already in talks for two of those
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is to try and develop and
accumulate data to try and develop the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between these chemicals and
different experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to integrate with companies
that have and are collecting data sets of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis experience reactions and finding
ways to tie those experience reactions
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the chemistry in a statistically
valid way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The danger here is that when you get into
experience, you're really talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: health information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be very careful about not
giving people health advice unless we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that what we're saying is really strongly
founded in verifiable science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been looking for data sets that are
sufficiently robust, sufficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed, and sufficiently valid,
unbiased to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second place where we've been looking
to accumulate data relates to pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a market approach to cannabis
where we're not trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: the biosynthesis of cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to be biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to be chemists.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're trying to do is look at how
cannabis behaves on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the different categories?
[SPEAKER_00]: We categorize it based on how the market
categorizes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really would like to be
accumulating is data about the pricing of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figuring out how different cannabis based
on its chemical content and based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: visual quality of it is selling at
different prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the second data set that we're
looking to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little bit about that today in
the presentation to explain how our
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of chemical differences relates
to the build out of a pricing prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third place where we really would like
to be integrating is with point of sale
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'd like to be integrating
there is I'd love to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: forward-looking view on where the demand
is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really would like to be able to get
demographics for how the demand for
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabis products is reaching
out into different demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built this product, Connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect.confidentcannabis.com,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect lets you explore different
cannabis strains in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really think that there's a potential
synergy there with people who are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: point of sale applications where we can
have Connect out in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could link it up to various point of
sale systems and we could help
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries figure out what they want to
order for the next month, to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand is going to be a month from now,
to help them pre-populate and do
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-orders for their next cannabis buys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that would get for us is
forward-looking perspective on where the
[SPEAKER_00]: market is moving and where demand is
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredibly interesting as far as
getting larger predictions across that
[SPEAKER_01]: market and the types of discussions those
things enable.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a direction, again,
from my perspective, you can align your
[SPEAKER_01]: vision to it and you can get a very
concise vision of where we're heading in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see everybody here at the
show and see the up-and-coming technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: but trying to eliminate a lot of that
confusion and getting hard specific data
[SPEAKER_01]: that allows for the fundamental backing of
what you're doing really is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've also given us a tool to the broader
community, something that we can ask
[SPEAKER_01]: questions of and interact with and get a
sense of how to essentially make
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's job a little bit easier and a
little bit more informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really wonderful
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Information in a very concise way is a
very powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been that way in the cannabis
community, but again, going back to old
[SPEAKER_01]: claims is an important part of the
scientific process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wonderful approach, I think,
the economic approach to the broader data
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, are you looking at all,
are you forming any other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: partnerships outside of the spheres that
you mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at more of policymaking,
for example, are you looking at public
[SPEAKER_01]: health sorts of information, or have you
had people interested on those fronts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the medical community, for example,
because cannabis is fundamentally a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the initial push to the legal
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of questions coming from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have looked at working with people who
are conducting clinical trials or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: double-blind studies of cannabis health
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing I can announce about that
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other group that we've looked to be
integrating with are folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting data about the effect of
different production method choices and
[SPEAKER_00]: different growth choices on chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I mean production methods,
what I mean is when you are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, there are thousands of choices
that you make in the growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think about cannabis and we think about
the strain, which is supposedly the seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't think about all the effort
and work and creativity that gets put in
[SPEAKER_00]: by the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things matter, how long they leave
the plant up, temperature, lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands and thousands and
thousands of choices that they make
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the production process that
have an enormous impact on chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who believe that we are
our genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people are their genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think plants are their genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's how life works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those choices that producers make
have a tremendous impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the areas where we've been looking
to team up with folks are folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting data across how different
choices in the production process
[SPEAKER_00]: influence that chemical outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that nature versus nurture discussion,
I think is just starting to activate on
[SPEAKER_01]: this end.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get more data as part of this
project, we'll dive into it and we'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: how fundamentally the creativity,
as you mentioned, of various growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: various producers across the space has
influenced the direction and the position
[SPEAKER_01]: where cannabis sits today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The products we know and love may just be
a broader sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The love you put into a product is
essentially the best-selling point
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially of your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be something there to it that
emerges from the data and the way you
[SPEAKER_01]: treat these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your talk today, I saw two major
distinctions in the data set that you
[SPEAKER_01]: presented and can be accessed through
Connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a turpinoline head form and we also
saw separations in THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other kind of fluid
separations starting to happen in that
[SPEAKER_01]: data set?
[SPEAKER_00]: A tremendous number of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are groups that cluster out because
of CBDV, because of CBN, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: linalool, because of various combinations
of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our data set is growing, we see more
clusters emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that our algorithm works,
you have to have a certain number of
[SPEAKER_00]: points that are friends of each other
before they can become a distinct cluster,
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain number of nearest neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our data set grows and we have enough
data for more of those clusters to emerge,
[SPEAKER_00]: those clusters are emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Connect, we call some of these things
regions where we discretize the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look for areas of the space where some
of the cannabis products have separated
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves from the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, I think, 20 or 30 of these
regions at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go through the region map and you
can see how each of these things has a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a very convenient way,
if you're looking to find a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry, it's a very convenient way of
finding that chemistry in Connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we start to get some of these groupings
emerge, how do you set the new bounds for
[SPEAKER_01]: new states that are emerging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, how is it that you draw a circle
around or a shape around that new grouping
[SPEAKER_01]: and identify it as a unique grouping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I may look at it and say,
well, I think this is a unique grouping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this as a unique grouping and
larger discrepancies may arise in the long
[SPEAKER_01]: term as we start to form this blob.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you approach those sorts of
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We use math for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we find the clusters?
[SPEAKER_00]: The question fundamentally is about how
you solve the problem of clustering in
[SPEAKER_00]: data science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem of clustering in data science
is that you get data and there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: points and somebody wants those points to
be divided into, you have a million
[SPEAKER_00]: points, but you need to divide them into a
sufficiently small number of groups that a
[SPEAKER_00]: human being can understand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want is a data-driven way to
separate them out into natural groups
[SPEAKER_00]: where the groups are, there are few enough
groups that you can go one after another
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the significant challenges
in data science today is different
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches to clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in data science, when you're
approaching the clustering problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need to ask the question,
what usage, what are these clusters going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that should guide your choice of
clustering methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clustering methodology that we chose,
the purpose of this clustering is not to
[SPEAKER_00]: take strong positions about how many kinds
of cannabis there are or what the
[SPEAKER_00]: boundaries between one kind of cannabis
and another are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are to help people navigate what's
otherwise a very complex topological
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 26 dimensional construct that
we've reduced to three dimensions with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very complex topology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to help people find their way
around that to navigate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we wanted was something that simply
discretizes that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also see in the space that we have
areas of the space that are very dense and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have areas of the space that are not
very dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted a clustering methodology that
was going to respect that and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to recognize that you can have a
non-dense area that is a cluster as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as a dense area that's a cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The algorithm that we're using is called
Optics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a bunch of different
density-based algorithms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to prefer density-based clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have very high dimensional data
like this, I prefer density-based
[SPEAKER_00]: clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of Optics over the two
competitive algorithms are DBSCAN and
[SPEAKER_00]: HDBSCAN.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with DBSCAN is that it is
non-adaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a single density barrier,
which is the boundary condition for all
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't respect that some clusters can
be more dense and some clusters less
[SPEAKER_00]: dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optics is dynamic with respect to its
boundary condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually Optics combined with another
algorithm that's dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: HDBSCAN is usually my favorite algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a hierarchical density-based
clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble is that HDBSCAN tends to
produce too few clusters and not as many
[SPEAKER_00]: as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optics had the natural balance where it
was able to produce the right number of
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters, a sufficiently small number that
a human being could comprehend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we set our boundary condition in
Optics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we actually do that through
optimization where we have a target number
[SPEAKER_00]: of clusters that we want to generate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a target number of clusters where
each cluster has a certain maximum and
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum number of points.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a one parameter to optimize in
Optics, the alpha parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a simple optimization algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we try and vary the alpha parameter
to hit into the acceptable range of
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The general clusters that you've provided
are just generally true clusters of the
[SPEAKER_01]: data itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're reflective of the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily a preference, so to say,
this cluster is this grouping of farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not giving selective preference,
for example, to anybody in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a data-driven approach to seeing
what this data looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its natural shape is not guided by outside
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we say is, how many clusters do
people want to deal with?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're willing to deal with, basically,
I think, between 12 and 30 clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's comprehensible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we say, we let the data
naturally find between 12 and 30 clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however many it finds, that's how many
clusters there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many clusters there are.
That's how many clusters there are.
