[SPEAKER_03]: What I wanted to start with before I talk
about myself and about my organization,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about the drug war and what
brought me here, which is social justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to understand and go
back not just to 1914 but to the modern
[SPEAKER_03]: day drug war and understand that our drug
laws have never been about the harms of
[SPEAKER_03]: the drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: But about who has been using the drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so let me read you a quote that Dan
Baum wrote an article.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you haven't read his book,
Smoke and Mirrors, I'd highly recommend
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this last year he wrote an article
called Legalize It All.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because from my perspective, marijuana is
the tipping point to get us to blow up the
[SPEAKER_03]: drug war completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which has been the largest abject failure
of policy in the United States since
[SPEAKER_03]: slavery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dan Baum stated in an article,
the Nixon campaign in 1968 and the Nixon
[SPEAKER_03]: White House had two enemies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The anti-war left and black people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know we couldn't make it illegal to be
either against the war or black.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by getting the public to associate the
hippies with marijuana and blacks with
[SPEAKER_03]: heroin and then criminalizing both
heavily, we could disrupt those
[SPEAKER_03]: communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could arrest their leaders,
raid their homes, break up their meetings,
[SPEAKER_03]: and vilify them night after night on the
evening news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we know we were lying about drugs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is the single best way and the
best reason for us to clearly not just
[SPEAKER_03]: blow up the drug war, but to look at
Proposition 64 that I will tell you is not
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it provides a social justice component
that no other adult consumption initiative
[SPEAKER_03]: or medical marijuana initiative has done
in our nation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today in the United States,
we make a cannabis arrest every 49
[SPEAKER_03]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whoever the mathematician is here,
starting when this started at 630 till
[SPEAKER_03]: when we end tonight, one person is going
to jail every 49 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost every minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine states are voting for adult
consumption or medical this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't just the five states that are
voting for adult consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Florida and we have other medical
marijuana states as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this last year in 2015, I think it's
critically important to understand that in
[SPEAKER_03]: the United States, we arrested 1,488,707
million people for all drug offenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of those, it was over 640,000 that
were for marijuana alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we start looking at the issues of
the arrest, is one of the things from my
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective as a career law enforcement
professional, what I saw occur is that our
[SPEAKER_03]: drug war policies has driven a wedge
between police professionals who used to
[SPEAKER_03]: be peace officers and would work in
collaboration with our communities to
[SPEAKER_03]: mindlessly policing people and causing the
issues that we see today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me tell you a little bit about who
I represent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Law enforcement against prohibition was
founded in 2002 by five police officers,
[SPEAKER_03]: four American, one Canadian, who all had
worked in law enforcement and again
[SPEAKER_03]: recognized the largest abject failure of
policy was in fact our drug war.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 2002, we have grown from five police
officers to over 5,000 current,
[SPEAKER_03]: former and retired, we're not just all
retired, criminal justice professionals
[SPEAKER_03]: representing the spectrum of anybody who's
ever touched somebody potentially going to
[SPEAKER_03]: jail or being arrested for drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chairman right now is actually an
active duty warden in New Hampshire who
[SPEAKER_03]: has one of the most progressive jail
systems that you will ever see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have police chiefs in the United States
that belong to our organizations as well
[SPEAKER_03]: as tons of retired DAs, retired police
officers, retired DEA agents, not just in
[SPEAKER_03]: the United States but across the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the pleasure this year to go speak
in the United Kingdom when we opened up
[SPEAKER_03]: our Leap United Kingdom branch in the
House of Commons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we look at what the drug war
has done and why marijuana or cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I hate to use the term marijuana,
is so important for legalization,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like for you guys not just to look at
California, because yes, we've been very
[SPEAKER_03]: progressive in California and we've
decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you possess less than an ounce of
marijuana, you get a traffic ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that recently came
to light is the Drug Policy Alliance who
[SPEAKER_03]: is one of the proponents of Proposition 64
did a report and in the last 10 years we
[SPEAKER_03]: have arrested almost a half million people
outside of those infractions for not just
[SPEAKER_03]: misdemeanors and felonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are still people today going to
jail for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the things that Proposition
64 does, if it passes, and I believe that
[SPEAKER_03]: it will, is that at 1201 midnight,
is anyone who's currently in jail for a
[SPEAKER_03]: felony that is now a misdemeanor,
what will occur, they can immediately ask
[SPEAKER_03]: to be re-sentenced to that lower
misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people that have been previously
convicted and maybe have already served
[SPEAKER_03]: their sentences, will immediately be able
to ask for their sentences to be reduced
[SPEAKER_03]: or expunged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we know that a drug conviction is
unlike any other conviction.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are collateral consequences to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's professional licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's loss of driver's licenses if
you're a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's loss of federal aid to student
loans.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a loss of housing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not be able to adopt a kid or get
welfare benefits or get food benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no other crime other than the
drug war that causes these types of
[SPEAKER_03]: collateral consequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I want to do, because I spent a
career in law enforcement, there's Redondo
[SPEAKER_03]: Beach people here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Joan, there's Beth, there's all
sorts of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in the South Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in South Torrance, graduated
from South High.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think for me, I always jokingly,
because I blogged prolifically,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I started in this space in 2010 during
the Proposition 19 campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've seen the full circle that
comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm encouraged for the future of where
I see not just the social justice issues,
[SPEAKER_03]: but where the industry is going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't see what people are afraid
of, which is the alleged big marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I see is the validation and the
support of the mom and the pop businesses,
[SPEAKER_03]: the spa owners that want to develop spa
products, the cultivators that are doing
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD water, the edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market is going to expand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that there's this fear that
adult consumption and Proposition 64 is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to impact patients' rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I would like to say is that one
of the leading attorneys, Bill Panzer,
[SPEAKER_03]: does everybody know or does anybody know
who Bill Panzer is?
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Northern California,
helps start normal in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the leading marijuana attorneys has
written an article.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he breaks down every section of
Proposition 64 with regard to patients'
[SPEAKER_03]: rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he says is there is no effect if
the Proposition 64 comes to fruition on
[SPEAKER_03]: patients' rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, it validates them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, because I unfortunately have
had to take kids away from their parents,
[SPEAKER_03]: is it will support a parent's right to not
have their children taken away from them,
[SPEAKER_03]: simply for being a qualified medical
marijuana patient, no different than if I
[SPEAKER_03]: had to take Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that there's hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jackie and I talked, is I don't want
to just sit here and talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to actually answer any questions
that you guys may have from a law
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if Proposition 64 passes,
is that law enforcement won't be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: use the smell of marijuana to search your
car or search your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to just kind of open up the
floor to questions and answers or
[SPEAKER_03]: questions and I'll answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Severi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell me something you don't like about
the way, something within Prop 64 that you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've talked about things you do like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that the concern is over
Prop 64 that there's this over-regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there's this fear that,
so from my perspective, is I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily think that it's
over-regulated, but sitting down with the
[SPEAKER_03]: people who authored it, because I've been
to editorial boards with them and I'm very
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in the campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want you to know, when I came into
the campaign, LEAP as an organization
[SPEAKER_03]: endorsed it because it met our social
justice issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't necessarily 100% on board.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until really sitting down
and talking to the authors where I've
[SPEAKER_03]: really come fully to grasp it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the worst thing about it
is that people are afraid because it's 62
[SPEAKER_03]: pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, I would tell you, having worked
in the space of law enforcement and seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: how laws get made, is that this is not
necessarily any different except for one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the things that happened is they had to
address so many issues around regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with a tomato, you have agricultural
components.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the initiative also had to cover
business and professions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had to cover taxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had to cover where the
allocations of money went.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what made it long.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that I like about it
is that there is, in fact, flexibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a taxing perspective, it's at a
15% excise tax, which is the lowest tax
[SPEAKER_03]: rate than any other adult consumption
initiative ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they took a look at, from a public
safety standpoint, is we're never going to
[SPEAKER_03]: eliminate the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody has ever said in any of the
ballot initiatives that we were going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I worked in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a week in Colorado during the
Colorado campaign doing presentations to
[SPEAKER_03]: Republican women's groups about why they
should support it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Stefan's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really kind of a very interesting
bipartisan support.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just Democrats that support
ending the drug war.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is actually some liberty-minded
Republicans that do as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's those issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough flexibility that,
down the road, that, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: is people are unhappy that it doesn't
repeal all cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the polling behind that is that if we
basically repealed every cannabis law
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, it would never pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd still be going out arresting
people in a very disparate fashion,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we do at this point, because all of
us need to recognize that we enforce our
[SPEAKER_03]: drug laws differently in WeHo,
in Redondo Beach, in comparison to South
[SPEAKER_03]: Central Los Angeles, or in East LA,
or in Santa Ana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have to get people that don't
necessarily believe in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just about the people who are in
the industry or the cannabis consumer or
[SPEAKER_03]: the patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to sell this to all the other
soccer moms that I speak to all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: and are absolutely petrified about this
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a long way of answering your
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that people don't like its length,
but there's not an understanding of why it
[SPEAKER_03]: became that lengthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I could just add to that,
and we were at the state of marijuana the
[SPEAKER_06]: other day, and Betty Yee, from State
Controller, was speaking, and she made a
[SPEAKER_06]: really important comment, which was that
the cannabis industry is really the first
[SPEAKER_06]: industry to raise their hands and say,
regulate us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to be regulated because we want
safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, number one, we want safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like we don't want to stay
underground anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we want to be a real business and
really exist in the rest of the world,
[SPEAKER_06]: then we do need to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, no, we don't need to be
overregulated, but we certainly need to be
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that was a consensus
among the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think the interesting part is
one of the things that people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand is that the fixes in the future
can't increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, you have all the
penalties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's still certain wobblers and
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we go down the road, we can lessen
the penalties if the sky doesn't fall,
[SPEAKER_03]: if everything works out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The money allocation for this is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that happens is that for
the first time, the excise taxes are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to go to communities of color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to start out at $10 million a
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at year five, it's going to increase
to $50 million a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people to be able to, it's going to go
to the business economic development.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to be able to do grants
to start businesses or to do education or
[SPEAKER_03]: jobs or other type of infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that's never happened in
any other initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's money that we're basically telling
the federal government.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do research on the efficacy
of medical marijuana because we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to give money to the UC system to
basically is research the efficacy of
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, what people don't understand,
and I spend a lot of time in this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: weird space crossing a lot of boundaries,
is today I read an article, is Botticelli,
[SPEAKER_03]: the drug czar, admitted that our United
States government has finally said,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, we've limited the amount of research
on the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 6% of the research by the National
Institutions for Drug Abuse has gone to
[SPEAKER_03]: show the efficacy of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: 94% has gone to show its harms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what people don't understand,
even in the industry, is NIDA funds 80 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% of the research, not just in the
United States, but across the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, is the United States on
a global level has pushed out this drug
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition policy and its impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born in Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dual citizen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a cousin who's a Mexican federally
down there, and we talk all the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we talk about the issues that are
going down in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: President Piano Nieto two weeks ago
basically stated if California legalizes,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's going to change the Mexican law in
Mexico and ask for marijuana to be
legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: He legalized in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will reduce death in the country that
I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing about drug
prohibition, that what people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand is the only thing that
prohibiting a substance has done is
[SPEAKER_03]: empowered cartels and the cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to be very honest about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has completely empowered us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's contributed to death,
disease, and addiction in our communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And LEAP exists to change that paradigm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need all your help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it's one of those very
interesting things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke cannabis, but I'm here
supporting people's right to do so because
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's objectively safer than
alcohol because in my 22 years I never
[SPEAKER_03]: once went to a house where someone who was
high beat the heck out of their wife,
[SPEAKER_03]: their kids, or molested them, or raped and
pillaged the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alcohol all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I believe that the only harms and
what causes violence is prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we ended the drug war completely,
we would reduce crime in impoverished
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhoods because we would take the
market share from people that are trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to survive by selling drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead, we can put money back in
there for jobs, education, infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_03]: public health, mental health programs.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else has a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is LEAP's position on legalizing the
rest of the drugs, heroin, cocaine,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So LEAP believes that the regulation of
drugs should be a state by state decision
[SPEAKER_03]: because substance use or abuse or,
you know, regulating the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: is different in California than it is,
let's say, in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: But around the issues of things like
heroin and cocaine, methamphetamine,
[SPEAKER_03]: or other opioids is that we believe that
nobody should go to prison for drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you commit a murder because you're high
or you get in a car and you drive under
[SPEAKER_03]: the influence or you break into people's
houses, go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that we should implement public health
strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, in Switzerland,
they have what's called heroin assisted
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're a chronic heroin addict,
you don't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get referred to a doctor who
prescribes you heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to a safe injection facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what Switzerland has seen and what
other countries have seen, including,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is Portugal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was implemented previously in Germany
and the United Kingdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada is now nationally going to be using
heroin assisted treatment program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it reduced overdoses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reduced addiction because by making it
a public health strategy, encouraged
[SPEAKER_03]: people to get into treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from the public safety standpoint,
the most fascinating thing in Switzerland
[SPEAKER_03]: it reduced property crime 60 to 80%
because you know why?
[SPEAKER_03]: People weren't breaking into our houses or
in our cars or stealing in order to get
[SPEAKER_03]: money to support their public health
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, we want to see the complete
elimination of drugs going to prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, in the United States that
may be a very difficult thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think what we can at least do is
decriminalize like Portugal did,
[SPEAKER_03]: who has seen some tremendous results in
their country where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: is you can possess up to 10 days of any
drug and you're not going to go to jail
[SPEAKER_03]: for it unless you commit a crime outside
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I referenced, I did online child
protection funded by the adult
[SPEAKER_02]: entertainment industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned one of the things
they're going to try to do is use you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, the fact that people are involved
and about child protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's going to be one of the
things that's really very important in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry for you to address and come up
with regulations on because they will use
[SPEAKER_02]: once you say kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the misnomer and Stefan and we
got a couple of attorneys in here that
[SPEAKER_03]: understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today in the United or in California
because I've had to deal with this
[SPEAKER_03]: situation, you can be an alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can abuse prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as you don't endanger your
child through some type of physical
[SPEAKER_03]: endangerment, you have to be able to
justify it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is you got a mom that's passed
out because she's addicted to prescription
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs and the three year old runs into the
street.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a reason to get child service
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem today is what you have is drug
endangered children laws that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: incentivized by the federal government.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is the California
Narcotics Officers Association trains the
[SPEAKER_03]: social workers under the drug endangered
children laws that were actually started
[SPEAKER_03]: because of the methamphetamine labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're now using it to take qualified
medical marijuana patients kids away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that so they're using the law
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's it's you've you've never
been able to just take people's kids away
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're growing marijuana or their
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is is that people don't have
the economic resources to hire attorneys
[SPEAKER_03]: in order to fight it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that's very clear that
has actually been written into Proposition
[SPEAKER_03]: 64 is added protection for medical
marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people will say, well, why didn't you
do it for the adult consumption market?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say because it's different in that
that it's going to be like alcohol in the
[SPEAKER_03]: sense of if you're in your home and you
smoke a joint, no one's going to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to come in and take your kid because you
smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you smoke a joint and you pass out and
your kid gets hit by a car, your kid's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get taken away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all about responsible parenting
and public service announcements.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we do owe medical marijuana
patients that added protection because we
[SPEAKER_03]: have definitely devastated families.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have time for another one?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I hate these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talked about or it was it was it was
talked about the fact that you could have
[SPEAKER_05]: point eight or eight grams on each person
if they were pulled over by a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's eight grams of concentrate and
you can have twenty eight point five grams
[SPEAKER_03]: of butter leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, is there anything in Prop 64 that says
that a law enforcement officer can't say
[SPEAKER_05]: that one person had all this on them so
that they can use it against people who
[SPEAKER_05]: are being pulled over?
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are so what?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my first question.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same second question at the
same time, because I know you probably
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, is there anything in Prop 64
that has that establishes a task force or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything like that that begins to see how
law enforcement units in neighborhoods of
[SPEAKER_05]: color or places like that are using them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to still end up in the same
place where we have, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: black kids get pulled over for for grams
and white kids go off to their party?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me say this about the kid issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the protections that has been put
into Prop 64 is right now it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: misdemeanor if you're under the age of 18
to possess any marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't get an infraction like
you do if you're 18 and above.
[SPEAKER_03]: So under Prop 64, it reduces that for our
children.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's only an infraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't so our kids can't go to jail
for having twenty eight point five grams
[SPEAKER_03]: or eight grams of concentrate or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that, but they can't get a fine
because if they can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the worst thing that's going to happen
to them is they go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to community service on top of
that for our children is that when they
[SPEAKER_03]: turn 18 today, your records, your kids
records don't get automatically expunged
[SPEAKER_03]: is when a kid turns 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they have any marijuana related arrest,
it automatically gets expunged off the
[SPEAKER_03]: record and the kids don't even have to
apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the people are are are saying,
oh my God, the 18 to 21 year olds are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I will tell you that I think those
18 to 20 year olds right now are
[SPEAKER_03]: incredibly smart and they're going to do
the exact same thing that they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing since Proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to co-opt the medical system
and get a recommendation because we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: change the recommendation language in any
way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same as MRSA, the same as the
language was an SB 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I had an 18 to a 20 year old who
wanted to imbibe in marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would tell them to go get a
recommendation to protect themselves from
[SPEAKER_03]: criminal statutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that doesn't understand the disparities
and enforcement practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's something that we need
to all be incredibly concerned about.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that happened in
Colorado is from a percentage standpoint,
[SPEAKER_03]: what you saw is that the wrong numbers of
arrests dropped significantly across
[SPEAKER_03]: Latino, African-American, whites.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem was is law enforcement was
still enforcing the laws in a disparate
[SPEAKER_03]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm going to tell you is that every
organization that was working in this
[SPEAKER_03]: space said it's not acceptable,
but what this is going to do is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to shine a light on the law
enforcement practices that we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be perfect, but I think
we're going to be able to get data because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a data-driven person and continue to
hammer away on why we need to continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: change law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe that there's systemic
structural racism in the criminal justice
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe that all law enforcement
officers are racist, but I also don't
[SPEAKER_03]: believe that you have to intentionally be
racist to participate in a system that has
[SPEAKER_03]: a disparity in enforcement practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we need to continue to move
towards changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't going to fix that, but it's
going to go a long way to addressing those
[SPEAKER_03]: issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Tomer Graciani.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is regarding the misdemeanor
or the felony going to a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that people that are in jail the
next day, September or November 9th,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be able to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what that process would
take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need to get a lawyer in order to
do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would they have to spend money?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens if everyone tries to do
it at once?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long would it take them to actually be
released?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: On November 8th, the Drug Policy Alliance
is, in fact, going to be hosting a party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it passes at 12 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: that morning, they're going to be holding
an expungement clinic that they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to have attorneys sitting there,
and people are going to be able to come in
[SPEAKER_03]: that night to start the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going to happen is it's going to
be a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if you look at what we've
done post Prop 47 relative to the
[SPEAKER_03]: expungement and the resentencing issues,
what you have is you have a ton of
[SPEAKER_03]: attorney firms that are working pro bono
with people like the Ella Baker
[SPEAKER_03]: Institution, with the Drug Policy
Alliance, and other organizations that are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing clinics across Los Angeles County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And relative to Prop 47, there was a
two-year window that you were going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry Brown just signed a bill that
extended that for another five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we need is we need attorneys who
can help in the pro bono fashion,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then other people, if they have the
economic resources to pay for attorneys,
[SPEAKER_03]: they may have to pay for their own
attorneys.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you, Diane Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
