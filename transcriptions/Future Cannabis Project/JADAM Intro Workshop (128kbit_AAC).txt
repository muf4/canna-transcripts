[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everybody doing out there today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me in the back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Joey Berger, and we're going to
teach you two natural farming inputs
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from a system of farming
called JDOM.
[SPEAKER_02]: The book was up here earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not here anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've heard of Korean natural
farming, this is a farming system
[SPEAKER_02]: developed by the Sun of Master Cho,
the founder of Korean natural farming,
[SPEAKER_02]: Young Sang Cho.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took his dad's teachings,
which were all about empowering the
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer, making farming simple,
farming the way nature farms, the way
[SPEAKER_02]: nature builds soil, and using plants to
make our own inputs, our own fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: our own pesticides, and basically a way to
make the farmer sufficient, empower them,
[SPEAKER_02]: give them their power back.
[SPEAKER_02]: These fertilizer companies they want to
make you feel dumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make you feel like you have
to be a soil scientist or you have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to the university.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our ancestors farmed very simply for eons
using plant and plants and using human
[SPEAKER_02]: manure and using animal manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very simple ways of farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we love this JDOM type of farming
because it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The inputs we're going to teach you today
are so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to say, I can't believe I sat
there and listened to these guys talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like these inputs because they're
basically free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I'm going to teach you today
is called JMS, JDOM Microbial Solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the most important
inputs in this JDOM natural farming system
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is the way to build the
biology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between dead dirt and alive
soil is the microbiology in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the invisible workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are billions of them under there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are shredders and decomposers.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are fixing nitrogen in the
soil, making it available for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are being eaten by larger
critters of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're being turned into nitrogen as
they go through their own gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more than anything, more than making
fertilizers, more than making pesticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: the most important thing in natural
farming you should be looking at is how to
[SPEAKER_02]: put the biology in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the different ways to do this are this
JDOM microbial solution, compost teas,
[SPEAKER_02]: aerated compost teas, and compost tea
extracts are another great way to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: biology into your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys covered the IMO process a
little bit in the last panel, the ferment
[SPEAKER_02]: cipher group talked about the IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are your indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a way to culture microbes in the
traditional Korean natural farming method.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this JMS, we love it because it's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be made with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of salt, a potato,
and a handful of microbes, which is this
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf mold soil that we're going to gather
deep in the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take you guys deep into the
untouched forest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my little pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come with me deep into the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to get up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going deep, deep into the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picture that I'm going to the untouched
forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to the untouched parts of the
forest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this oak trees over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to want to pull back the
non-decomposed leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get through that non-decomposed layer of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to the untouched areas of
the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I live, the land's really steep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to a tree and you go to that
uphill side of the tree and the leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: have been building up there for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be the thickest leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to pull back the
non-decomposed leaves and you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: find those leaves, those breaking down
leaves that are on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call this leaf mold soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the microbes from the soil are
starting to break that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are shredders and
decomposers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're literally in there breaking
that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to find the best stuff, you want to
look for these white strands of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is a jackpot, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have thought I planted this over
here for this demo, but you want to look
[SPEAKER_02]: for the white, that white, that white
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are huge colonies of fungi and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: These strands of mycelium, they connect
these plants and these trees underground
[SPEAKER_02]: and they can share nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can warn each other of pests and
pathogens that they can prepare their
[SPEAKER_02]: defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to bring this out here and
show it to anybody that wants to see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white stuff, you know about this,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are your decomposers, your
shredders, your fungi and your bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just collected them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thrive here at this temperature,
at this elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their home.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to turn that leaf into soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to use just a little tiny
bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to introduce you to my friend
R2D2 right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a five-gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's maybe a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a seven-gallon bucket?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the bucket that we use at home to
make JMS and the jadam liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do our feedings through this bucket
with a dositron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got your five gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already filled it up because ain't
nobody got time for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to take three ingredients,
salt, potatoes, and this leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first ingredient is going to be 25
grams of salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I weighed this out already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I didn't mix these jars for the
weekend up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pour this in here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use sea salt, or you can go to the
ocean and gather seawater.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to dissolve this in here,
stirring it with a wooden stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to use metal when you're
working with microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't react well with microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just dissolving this sea salt in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we go to the ocean to gather this
seawater, we'll take a bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll weigh it out into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to gather from those top
three inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just skim from the top of the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the most diversity of aquatic
microorganisms are, is where that water
[SPEAKER_02]: meets the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever you've got an edge, you've got
the most diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also want to gather that water near
the brackish waters where the river enters
[SPEAKER_02]: the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get even more diversity of
microbes if you can gather that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you bring that salt water home,
open that bucket up or that container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it breathe overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that salt will burn off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can use that seawater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mix it in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anybody download the SOP this week?
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually bring them with and hand them
out, but we didn't want to do all the
[SPEAKER_02]: paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get to follow along.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of you guys are out of luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have followed my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Download the SOP, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to save paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had the SOP, you'd see the
material list here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five gallon food grade bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to skip the dilution tank
because we're not going to cover that
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 grams of boiled potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That little tiny potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what that weighs.
[SPEAKER_02]: 96 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to use this whole potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use more potato than you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this potato is going to be a
food source for these microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be multiplying in this
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this water is going to tell us when
it's all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to tell us when these microbes
are at their peak growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take this potato and I'm
going to take this sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stuff this potato in this
sock, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of erotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to like make a little song or
something like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the erotic part of the show right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to put a couple tiny
sharp rocks in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just going to make it a little
easier to bust up this potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody got a sharp rock there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part of the show where you
guys participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a rock on this property.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really boiled the hell out of this
potato earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to mash it by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also kind of erotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever squeezed a boiled potato,
it feels great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels great.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, we've got our 25 grams of sea
salt went in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're stirring it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three sharp rocks just went in the sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to lose our SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all over the place, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing they're not filming this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 grams of boiled potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the easy way to remember is 50 grams
of potato, 25 grams of sea salt,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 grams of leaf mold, which is very
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got my sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to show you how little that leaf
mold is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 16 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using just a small handful of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's our 20, 25 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 26.8.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see, it's a handful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole thing we're going to use
for this five gallons right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it up for my lovely assistant here.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to stuff this leaf mold in
this sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a two-man job.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the erotic part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't watch, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't watch this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tie that off for me,
please?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it out of your hair, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've got our sock with our potato
with our leaf mold in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we were going to culture
crop-specific microbes, say for like
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, at this point, we would go and
grab a couple of leaves off of that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant, and we'd throw them in
this sock also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now you're going to encourage
microbes that like cannabis to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and start cultivating, to start
inoculating this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're growing tomatoes,
throw a couple little leaves of the tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: plant in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing potatoes, grow a couple
little leaves of the potato in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing cannabis, throw a
handful of ganja in there, just a leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: just a veg leaf will be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got our bamboo stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already watered this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's nice about the JMS, too,
is once you do it enough that you'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: those measurements in your head,
and then you don't even have, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: need after a while to measure,
especially your leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just go grab a handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get too much, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing with the potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get too much, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing to be really consistent with
is your salt water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either your sea water or your salt
to make sure that that is like really
[SPEAKER_01]: exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rest, eh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sea water has 93 micronutrients in it,
minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sea water is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to work that into your garden
where you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a free input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that close to the ocean here,
but it's worth the drive to the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got our sock in there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm going to do is I'm going to
massage this into this water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to massage that potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember we put those sharp rocks in
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to help break that potato up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to massage the leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to massage the microbes out of
that sock into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tamara's going to hold the microphone
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one thing you got to make sure is
you need warmer water when you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This won't work if your temps are under 64
degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made three of these this spring
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first two were great slam dunk,
but we were having hot weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my last one that I made about a week
ago during that cold snap, total fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even started it in the greenhouse where
it would be a little warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't warm enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your water's really cold and it's
underground, fill up your bucket the day
[SPEAKER_02]: before so that that water will sit out and
be a little warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I will cheat and use the warm
water from the hose that's been sitting in
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I know this water's really cold,
I'll heat it up, you know, put a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In hot, warm weather, this is going to be
done in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hot there in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be done really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold weather, those first ones I made in
February and March, they took about a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could take up to five days,
seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you make this in hot weather,
you're going to get a lot of big bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you make this in cold weather,
you're going to get small bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm talking about there is how we
know this is done, how we know this is at
[SPEAKER_02]: its peak microbial growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to massage this in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel this potato getting all broken
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel the leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: This water's looking a little grayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rigged this up with a bamboo stake so
that this will sit right in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: this bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the vortex of microbes that you want
to hang in the middle because there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole vortex of microbes that happens
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're able to multiply faster if
this is in the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the way you know this is done is
you're going to get tiny bubbles are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to start coming up around the edges.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you're first going to notice
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these bubbles are going to get
bigger and they're going to get more
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when this is at its peak growth is
when the whole top of this is covered with
[SPEAKER_02]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: A solid pizza is what we like to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have about a 12-hour window when
it's at its peak growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in hot weather, you'll check it in the
morning and be like, oh, it's not done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you didn't check it in the
evening and it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over the hill the next morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you know it's over the hill is the
bubbles will have started to break up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll start pulling away from the sides
of the bucket and those bubbles will start
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are your microbes starting to die
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've reached their peak growth and
they're dying off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could still use this as a liquid
fertilizer at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could still dilute it and use it,
but it's not going to have the diversity
[SPEAKER_02]: of microbial life in there that we're
really looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, when this is at full pizza shell,
I know when it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we prefer this over doing an
aerated compost tea where you have to brew
[SPEAKER_02]: it at a certain temperature and a certain
length of time and you need to scope it to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure it has the life in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is telling me when it's at its peak
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why this is so available for any
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we massaged that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to run through the SOP for
you guys a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, you're going to loosely
cover this with your lid and just leave it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the center of your garden in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want it in the garden where you're
going to use it because the microbes that
[SPEAKER_02]: are there that are present are going to
start multiplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are your indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to capture them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if your water temperatures get too
low, you can put a water heater in this,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little like aquarium water heater and
heat it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an easy way to do these in the
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we go to feed this, we will dilute
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're feeding empty beds that aren't
plentiful, no plants in them, we'll dilute
[SPEAKER_02]: this 10 times into water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will make 50 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: This five gallons, I put into a 50 gallon
drum of water and then feed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm pumping it through drip systems or
hoses, I flush those lines for a good five
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes with clean water afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get microbial buildup in there and
things can get gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flush those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm watering beds that are planted or
nursery plants stuffed with the ganja in
[SPEAKER_02]: it right now, I'm diluting it at 20 to
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No plants in the soil, 10 to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would make 100 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fill up that 50 gallon barrel twice with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to move this with a pump,
low pressure pumps are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diaphragm pumps are best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you start pumping anything with
high pressure, it's going to shred your
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria and your fungi and start beating
your microbes up and kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pumping them one time through a low
pressure pump into your drip system or
[SPEAKER_02]: into your dilution tank, not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use those pumps to aerate these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to shred them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a low pressure diaphragm pump if you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we go to feed this, this also mixes
well with the JDOM liquid fertilizers that
[SPEAKER_02]: Tamara is going to teach you next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will combine the liquid fertilizers
into a feeding at the same time that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing these microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, this is the most important
thing in our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have enough biology and good
microbes in our soil, we don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to fertilize as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to water as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why the forest functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The forest doesn't need to be watered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't need to be fertilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: This soil is full of microbial life that's
performing its functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that's vacant is when you start
having the pests and the pathogens come
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: When there's good biology in the soil,
we say there is no good and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have a healthy balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only when things get out of balance
that do any of these things become a pest
[SPEAKER_02]: or a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all present all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need them in balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we do farming that mimics nature,
these natural practices, it's a lot easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to stay in balance with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm done, I'll also wash out my
sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rinse out my sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a 100% cotton sock because the
microbes actually break this stuff down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't use like a synthetic sock or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's best to apply this in the evening to
your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way your soil will stay moist longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want those microbes to be able to get
a foothold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water in the evening, or even better,
water before a rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rain will water it down in
the soil, take it deep down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff is so safe and so beneficial,
you could do it with every watering,
[SPEAKER_02]: every single watering if you did it those
dilution rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to do it at least once a week,
or at least every other week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do that, we're alternating the
other week with a compost TX with a
[SPEAKER_02]: compost extract, which we'll probably talk
about that to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a very simple, easy way to get
some biology in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just making sure that every week
we're adding a different set of biology to
[SPEAKER_02]: our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diversity, you hear us talk about
diversity a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want a diverse set of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys just heard the biochar talk over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've used this JMS to charge biochar
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you make that biochar, you need to
get the microbes up into it to establish.
[SPEAKER_02]: JMS is a great way to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made big windrows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six feet wide, five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this at a farm last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got 80 yards of biochar that we had to
charge, and we used JMS, and we used pond
[SPEAKER_02]: water that was full of aquatic
microorganisms, and we used a compost T,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we used jadam liquid fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the very least, you guys, you should
apply this to your soil three times a
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in the springtime before you plant,
which should be at that 10 to 1 dilution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once before you go into flowering during
transition time as you're going from veg
[SPEAKER_02]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing full term, that's end of
July, somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least over by us, probably same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once again before you put your
beds away for the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again before the winter rains come,
or right before that winter rain comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys learned some things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff is very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we make this in a 50 gallon drum,
we do a pound of potatoes, a half pound of
[SPEAKER_02]: sea salt, and a half pound of leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those are some really easy numbers
to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still go online on my Patreon at
the link on my bio at the Humboldt Local
[SPEAKER_02]: 2.0 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link there to my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download these SOPs for free
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please go grab those and let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody got any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say again?
[SPEAKER_02]: I live over in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we live in Middletown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to the farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Trent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold water is the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are messaging me right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to make them in this
springtime weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that water needs to be 64 or 68.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would either either fill this bucket up
ahead of time the day before, let it sit
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black plastic could be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is why this looks like R2D2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrapped this reflective insulation
around this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys could wrap a blanket around it
would help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like that would help insulate
this bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it in your greenhouse if you got
really cold weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what we did for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question, Trent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else before I turn this over to
Tamara?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tamara is going to talk a little bit about
this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these two inputs really tie in
well together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to introduce Tamara Thorne,
owner of Heal Thyself Gardens,
[SPEAKER_02]: a Dempere certified farmer, and my
sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's going to talk to you about JDOM
liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it up for Tamara, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Joey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so a couple things I want to mention
on the JMS is like, because y'all over
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Grass Valley, North San Juan are
very similar to our growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we have in Lake County, it's really
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I've noticed on 100 degree days,
104 degree days, it's like 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have had that happen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are really like, it's kind of
rare, but that's like, it has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of check them on those really
hot days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I don't know if any of y'all
know what Sea Green is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all remember, y'all know that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this would replace your Sea Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, this is what, like, when I first
found out about this, I kind of like blew
[SPEAKER_01]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was paying $800 a bucket for Sea
Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was understanding what they was
trying to do, like this microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I started understanding,
like, once I learned how to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I realized that probably all that
stuff I'd been feeding my plants out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that bottle really wasn't alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably had already died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're taking my plants,
you're taking microbes from another
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, especially from the sea and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're bringing into your dry
environment, it's not the same microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to die off really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't, they could start
attacking your ones that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want your native indigenous
microorganisms to be in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how your garden's going to
thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some things to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how, like, when I found out about
this, like, it was pennies compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: those buckets I was buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once you do it over and over,
it becomes really routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get the hang of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start realizing your temperatures
and how to, you know, you just do it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practice makes perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I'm going to talk about is the
JDOM liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is your liquid fertilizer that
you can make with plant materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal wastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in just water and leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your first thing that you're going to
do, like what I've got in this bucket is
[SPEAKER_01]: you need your five-gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need some plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about plant material
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll go into the animal manures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get your plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to harvest a bucket full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't finish the bucket because I
wanted to show you all what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these pieces, too, like when
I'm harvesting, you see how these are
[SPEAKER_01]: dried?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of take those out because,
you know, we're looking for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something when you're looking
for your plant material to harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want it to be alive and fresh and look
really, you know, healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take off some of that
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're just going to cut like
your plant material into about like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do two to four inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just doing two to four inches here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I usually just harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it's anything that's dried,
I'll just cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just do it directly into the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to not have so many steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can just harvest and then just put
it directly into the bucket, it makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you want to fill your bucket
up to where like I've tried to fill this
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I press my hand down,
it's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's not much give.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after this is filled, then you just
fill it with water and leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put this leaf mold over
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I had some water over here,
then we'd put water over it, put a lid on
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and boom, you just put that in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the plant material, I know we
have it on our, on the SOPs if you
[SPEAKER_01]: downloaded, there's a few different things
about the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much on here though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like right now what I went and did is
I did a grass JLF.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grass JLF is going to be for your
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I went and harvested is
anything that was still vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anything that was like already
flowering these grasses over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of had to go search because some of
these are all flowering about to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those would be really good during
transition or flowering fruiting times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grasses I went and got,
I had to hunt down some miners lettuce and
[SPEAKER_01]: just some of the other taller grasses,
which is nice because you want stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like have a lot of growth hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went and got the taller grasses,
nothing that's gone to seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this JLF, if we make this now,
we'll be ready in about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's going to be filled with
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to be filled with any of
these micronutrients from the soil that's
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a really basic one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get a little bit like more in
depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you start knowing your plants,
you know, your nettle, your nettle has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also has calcium, iron, magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every year I like to get like a 50
gallon barrel of it made and just do all
[SPEAKER_01]: nettle because that nettle is really good
during veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also your comfrey, comfrey is
another high one in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all comfrey one, borage, borage is,
I think it's potassium for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're in transition there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you know, in your plants,
what is in those plants and kind of do
[SPEAKER_01]: some research into that because like
borage and mugwort, high in potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really good during transition time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have like anything that's fruiting
or flowering is really good during,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, flowering and fruiting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of your apples coming out,
any of your fruit trees, blackberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just anything that's fruit and
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunflowers are really high in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're all like in their flower
side, about to go to seed, harvest them
[SPEAKER_01]: and put them in your buckets or barrels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other all parts really like the veg time,
it's going to be just anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: veggie, but it's the whole plant except
for the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We leave the roots so it can kind of come
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like if it but then once it's
flowering, you're wanting to take it like
[SPEAKER_01]: if these all these grasses start flying,
like I'm saying here right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is good because it's not seeded yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be good during transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's seeded, then it's really good
during flowering and fruiting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any of your flowers, you can start
gathering spring flowers now too that can
[SPEAKER_01]: go in for your flower teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking of some others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, cannabis, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prune, like one of our big prunes we do is
during transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of course, it's the best tea during
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made it clear, you know, we go inside
and clean out those girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have at least a 50 gallon bucket
depends on how many plants you got at
[SPEAKER_01]: least a five gallon bucket of all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's we just turn that into a
JLF, you know, fill that with water,
[SPEAKER_01]: put the leaf mold on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 10 to 10 days, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything and it's like that with any of
your anything that you are growing if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's tomatoes, if that's peas,
it's squash, that plant is going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: best thing to feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So squash is great to feed back to squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis back to cannabis, you know,
it just goes like that because that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has everything the nutritional needs that
that plant needs to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: horsetail, horsetail just went and
harvested really high in silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good for structural support
of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to add that in like pretty much
through it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's another one to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing we teach to make is a
Jadam herbal solution that we make out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the horsetail, which is really good for
PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So horsetail is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you can find a good horsetail
spot, go harvest because it's also good
[SPEAKER_01]: for you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nettle and horsetail are two of the best
things for our plants, but also two of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best things for us also because it's had
so many minerals and vitamins and silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like packed full of nutrients
that we need as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the thing with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really you can use your
intuition with if you see something
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering like milk thistle is really nice
right now before it flowers, use it for
[SPEAKER_01]: veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just filled of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus it has growth hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff is powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you look at those plants,
see like how fast does it grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's growth like hormones in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The milk thistle once it starts flowering
great for flower tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with your animal manures,
those of course we're really great for
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do my strike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell like a nitrogen shot is what I do
with the chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll fill either a 50 gallon barrel up
or a five gallon bucket depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: much I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love to start the year with like a
50 gallon barrel of chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just fill that up and I'm not
and you don't need to fill it all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: up for the manures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The manures you're gonna do about like I
do about a third of the bucket for the
[SPEAKER_01]: manures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's a little much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can do about a fourth but a
third I feel like it gets a good strength
[SPEAKER_01]: on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing fill it up with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your leaf mold and then wait for about
10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing to know if your JLFs are
really stinky because they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll become smelly and you're like oh
my god is this thing rancid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it gets too smelly for you we're
just like I can't take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some more leaf mold in it or some
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even used mushrooms that have gone
bad out of the fridge and just stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to like really start breaking
it down faster and the smell goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just a little tidbit I found
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can also use some of your stuff
you'd use for top dressings like kelp or
[SPEAKER_01]: oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would do the same thing you would
do with the animal newers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do about a third, a fourth down the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then same thing again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill up with water in your leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to want those to be in
the same temperature like with your JMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that right by your garden where
it's all the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's breaking down at the same
temperature that your garden's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're brewing all those microbes that
we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah maybe go through this to make
sure another really good one is
[SPEAKER_01]: blackberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get that blackberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's overtaking all of our
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another growth stimulant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that stuff is powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can break through anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feed that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That right there when it's vegging that's
a great veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also when it is fruiting but not ready
yet take that for a transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of your fruits that are untreated
and ripe that's another thing to use
[SPEAKER_01]: during transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course the blackberry you can
use when it's all the way fruited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of use it through all stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to take these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we usually use these at about a 30 to
a one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's are the grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually do about a 20 to a one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just depends on how much nutrients are in
the things you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually my gauge is about a 30 to a
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: On everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the things with these liquid
fertilizers is that they don't go bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just get stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've had one and it's over a year
then you're going to instead of doing a 30
[SPEAKER_01]: to one you're going to do 60 to one
because it's going to be stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every year you're going to cut it
down a little bit more depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: long they've been brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I missing anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: In natural farming we have what is called
the nutritive cycle theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Tamara was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast growing leafy green shoots for veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unripe fruits and flowers for transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ripe fruits, flowers and buds for
fruiting and flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these inputs are important to make
seasonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go out right now while things are in
veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go out and gather the miner's lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go out and gather the dead nettle that
was only out for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: The horsetail is just now starting to pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out in the forest and start to know
your land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start to know what these plants are
seasonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to tell you what should be
feeding these things this time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every farm we go out on to consult they
have blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the easiest ferment we could all be
making right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fast growing green shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill up a 50 gallon barrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw a couple of gallons of leaf mold in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use your urine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's already dead you can use that for
compost or mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good for that because you're
wanting the life out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're putting in here you're
taking the life out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mycelium is liquefying it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to strain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really good 220 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some good microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use some of my old hash bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a bunch of really good filter
bags I found on Amazon that go over your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a little fun research on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just makes it really easy for you to
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can strain it enough for it can go
through your fertilizer injectors and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of your irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we do the irrigation we do rinse it
through which is straight water because
[SPEAKER_01]: this can get really stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do add these two together a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the JMS and the JLF.
[SPEAKER_01]: The JLF is what you would use instead of
your feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing bloom, veg, all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having to buy those at the
grocery store you're making your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this is replacements of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what this is for.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really old technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even found it in my herbalist books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really old text where they're just like
grab the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill it with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in some mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I held in a couple books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like wow that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them didn't even say put mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like a bucket and plant
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: This JDOM liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just an ancient technique that
we're taking from indigenous people.
[SPEAKER_01]: From our ancient ancestors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going into our urine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also pee in these buckets as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can put leaf mold on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: After six months you can use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just straight nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will just give it a good shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to give other things
too but that will be a straight nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: shot for those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done any humanure yet but
people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done horse manure, chicken manure,
goats, all of these others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love rabbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love rabbit manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one thing that our main animal
that we're having on our farm because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: also high in phosphorus, potassium,
the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good one you can use all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it directly onto the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to wait for it to compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of our things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that we do at the farm,
the JDOM liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 50 gallon barrels all by our
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have tons of different buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll go on a little mission to
the ocean and find fish at the old fish
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning stations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have just a bunch of bones and
just grossness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go fill some five gallon buckets
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill it up with water and put some leaf
mold on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then put it in some place that we don't
have to walk by very often for three
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like your fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we've also done kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone and harvested stuff at the
ocean and done the same thing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: mussel shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dilution rates on this kind of
depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start at about a 20 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how long it's gone for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The least amount of time is usually about
10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you check it and see if it looks like
it's done its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually about 10 days is you can start to
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer it goes, the stronger it gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 10 days, do it at a 20 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as it gets stronger, I usually do
everything at about a 30 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've usually been going for at least a
month or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at your sheet, you can see we
have some different things like urine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to go for six months at a 50
to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your fish waste at a 100 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use horsetail as a 20 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of your plants start out at a 20 to
1.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chicken manure is also another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it right here where you want it to
go for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done it in 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not as strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The month makes it really strong if you
can let it go for that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at 100 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the buckets or the 50 gallon barrels
are emptied, after we're done with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't clean it out or empty them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just leave that old plant material in
there and let it just keep breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're just going to pile on more
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then fill it up with water again and leaf
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can continuously keep doing that
because eventually that old stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: completely liquefies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it just keeps happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never clean these buckets out when
they've been designated as our JLFs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any questions on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any more questions?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whorehound?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't used whorehound for the JLFs
just only because I haven't found that as
[SPEAKER_01]: much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I find it, I usually use it for my
smoking blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love whorehound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good expectorant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking whorehound, it's in the mint
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a smellier herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be good as a jadam herbal
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be good as a pesticide because
we're going to concentrate that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it would go into the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a really good JLFs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would use that one for.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just look around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grasses, your miner's lettuce,
your cleaver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of these spring grasses that just came
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now in the late spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to look around for the spring
flowers that are blooming, the summer
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to start making the bloom and
fruiting ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then transitions will come soon too as the
fruits on the trees are just starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start on those after we start
pruning the trees a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really nice about this is you
follow the growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, okay, this is what we're
doing today and we've got to get it all
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to really follow nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's springtime now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to get the grasses for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now we're going in transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going into fruiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just follow with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a very organic system of working
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine did a rat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, yeah, yeah, just same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put a lot of leaf mold in water
and put it somewhere we didn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, but yeah, you definitely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it was so beautiful about these
two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love showing them because they're so
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally just went out and harvested
the grasses, the horsetail, and the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaf mold here is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of your drier regions, of course,
where we don't have as many oak trees out
[SPEAKER_01]: where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you said, we have to go up on
the upper side behind the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to get down far in there,
but I've also seen, too, in really dry
[SPEAKER_01]: places, you don't always see the white
striations, but you know that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually there because as long as you get
past the top leaf layer, then you will
[SPEAKER_01]: find some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's just a little white on part
of the leaf, then it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually, I'll just fill a bucket up with
the unripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing within the water and the
leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will do separate sometimes
depending on what the nutritional needs of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants are and also if we got to go to
the ocean and harvest something or if we
[SPEAKER_01]: found something, but I also create
multiple plant ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have barrels set aside that are veg
transition and flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are 50 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two 50 gallons of each,
actually more at this time, but then those
[SPEAKER_01]: are all multi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the veg, I'll go and take from,
we went and did mallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a bunch of mallow we harvested,
a bunch of nettle, and then a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: just spring grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a falfa from the straw we had laid
or hay we had laid down before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were able to harvest all that
and put it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some milk thistle was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of like whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I do for our veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll do certain ones,
like I said, just little specific ones
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what I'm able to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing for transition and
fruiting, different kinds of fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flowers all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just a mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to do that for their main
feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then add in a little mistletoe for
some phosphorous or an extra little here
[SPEAKER_01]: or there of the other buckets that you
have laying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of gets to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to be like the cook in the
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just do them all out of your 50
gallon barrels that you mixed all those
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs and that's just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that actually when I first started
and it worked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just became fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm like, oh, I could go get
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have horsetail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it's just being able to go and
harvest what you can and share resources
[SPEAKER_01]: with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've had a lot of fun doing input
making parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also connecting with our
neighbors and seeing what like more plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have on their land compared to
ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can, you know, kind of come
together and work together for these,
[SPEAKER_01]: for your nutrient needs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for coming and
listening to our talks.
