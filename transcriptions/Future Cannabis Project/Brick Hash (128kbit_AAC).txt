[SPEAKER_06]: Around with the Mexican banquets,
it just took the top of your head off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, that's the CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with this Jamaican stuff that you get
in England, and they would call it
[SPEAKER_02]: sensimilia, you know, sensi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like this dark, you know,
like probably a really good indica grown
[SPEAKER_02]: high in a cold altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, we as kids in England,
we'd get like hydro weed grown in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam and it'd get you high,
but this stuff would have been obliterate
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would pay a lot for a little gram,
and we never understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like, what's going on now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was a CBN the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN is the culprit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My love of hash is CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's I really come to appreciate
that kind of annoyance amongst all of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you don't seem like someone who eats
uppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you hit it on the head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very low energy right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if I needed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I didn't have a thousand milligrams of
tincture in me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that is the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody suffering from anxiety or
anything like that, CBN is so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you took what?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the starting material?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take the brick press and I heat it in
a natural process just using boiling
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about the round patty over
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look right there.
That?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you start with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're starting with?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting material is raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been pressed already in a
different press.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the starting material is exactly this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a raw material.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has never been pressed or heated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a cold extract product.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be non-activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, completely non-carboxylated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is not psychoactive at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you could eat this right now and a
little bit psychoactive because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not super high levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute you add heat in this process or
any pressing process, you're converting
[SPEAKER_02]: and decarboxylating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you're essentially taking off that
carbon molecule to make it bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this process, you're just
applying about three or four tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure in a heated square mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has about 120 grams in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just leave it for about 10 minutes
so the heat can really, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: really activate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, what everyone loves
about hash is that activated principle of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to leave it about 10 minutes and
then you get it on and you get a really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very reminiscent of the Moroccan
style of pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody that's from that part of the
world or anybody who ever smoked hash in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, when they see a brick like this
sliced up, they all of a sudden get that
[SPEAKER_02]: nostalgic little moment of, oh,
shit, I remember that from Amsterdam or
Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very manual process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it need to be or are they automated?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it doesn't need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure how automated you
could make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty of all of this stuff from my
point of view, one of the beauties is the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that it is artisanal and the
scalability is limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm sure you could scale it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always imagine in my head, because the
temple ball process is very, very
[SPEAKER_02]: laborious, which is part of the beauty of
it because you're putting all that
[SPEAKER_02]: intention into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we could even get spiritual
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's forget that for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's laborious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always thought, you know,
what kind of machine could you make?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would kind of be like you would
basically have to replicate the intestinal
[SPEAKER_02]: tract of a rabbit, because all you need is
little poop balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you put the hash in one end,
and the other end you get little poop
[SPEAKER_02]: balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be a machine like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the cats that eat the coffee
beans?
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to train rabbits to eat hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had just a hash diet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is a gram the ideal selling point?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because to me, it's like it should be
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, I mean, let's call BCC and
tell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest reasons we are
restricted to a gram is because we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed as a manufacturer of extracts to
exceed a thousand milligrams in our total
[SPEAKER_02]: dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our products right now are ranging
between 600 and 700 total milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we could do one at 1.2 grams,
but then that would be kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of why we're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no hash makers are allowed to have a
product that is no extract, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: oil, whether it's butane, hexane,
alcohol, anything can exceed the thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it goes with tinctures as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're talking about this size,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So nobody can make like a big bowl and
sell it to the Californians.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cool things you can do and what
we're going to start experimenting with is
[SPEAKER_02]: like mixing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have the traditional curing
method, you get the certain darker types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you use the vacuum freezer and
you get a very blonde one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want to do and again,
the blonde one will have a lot less CBN
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just part of that natural curing
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting the CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: But putting that aside for a second,
what I want to do is I want to then braid
[SPEAKER_02]: the two different distinct colors together
and then cut them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll end up with like a sort of like
a floral pattern or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you think about it, you can buy
as many of these or pretty much as,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can buy two or three of these
different grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes no sense for you to not be
able to sell a two and a half.
[SPEAKER_06]: A three and a half gram or a ball or a
jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, when it comes to things like rosin,
especially that, you know, and dabble with
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know there's a lot of people out
there who would love that and they got
[SPEAKER_02]: used to that, you know, buying 10 grams at
a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The BCC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to look far closer because it's
across the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is kind of done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put these back on to keep it in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you're going to pull out is
literally like the brick hash I would
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke in France.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: The California equivalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference, the only biggest
difference is the fact that they're using
[SPEAKER_02]: a dry sift product to start with and we're
using a cold water extracted product to
[SPEAKER_02]: start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the pressing process, exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end, you get a brick hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ka-ching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one didn't come out as
homogenized as I would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would probably, you know,
maybe even repress it, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get the idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically back in the day, they'd crank
out thousands of those and then some dude
[SPEAKER_05]: would bring them into France and Spain and
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when we were kids in Spain,
when we were lucky, we would smoke brick
[SPEAKER_02]: hash because the alternative was what we
would call Borbuja, which says bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what bubble refers to is the,
or huevo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the type of hash that was
routinely smuggled into the country using
[SPEAKER_02]: ingestive means.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would ingest it in pellets and
then they would of course have to wait
[SPEAKER_02]: till it came out the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now as a consumer, you know, and they've
done tests in modern times, in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few years ago and over 85 or 86% of all
hash in Madrid had, you know, E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli and feces in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there was that and it did
smell like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when we were lucky,
we had the brick hash, but usually we had
[SPEAKER_02]: the ass hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was growing up in Spain for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, I would probably,
you know, if this was perfect,
[SPEAKER_02]: which it isn't, I would probably freeze
dry it or, I mean not freeze dry it,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, vacuum seal it and then keep it in
a nice environment where it can cure up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little else for easy packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry, show me the, grab the apple and
show me the starting material again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the starting material and that's
the end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, stay back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can even do a nice little slice of the
brick, which is always fun to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the, what's in the bowl is,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's very little THC, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's not decarboxylated basically?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what about the brick?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that kind of work?
[SPEAKER_05]: The opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean just that process decarboxylated
the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this regard, probably, yeah,
most of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're having a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 300 degrees in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those, so those plates, cause I missed
the first part, you basically boil the
[SPEAKER_05]: plates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that gets them to what's the
boiling point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it gets a boiling point, then you can
make probably three or four bricks from
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before it cools down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it cools down.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, definitely the, the science of
it is more tradition than science,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this was the traditional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what we do for our purposes at Cali
Hash is we don't actually use this method
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a temple balling method where the
raw material is taken by each person and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, you know, per gram uniquely pressed
by each Hash Hashim, each person.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, the, uh, more jaggedy one is what
they would start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would start with a product like
this, and then you would take a gram
[SPEAKER_02]: worth, you put it in the palm of your hand
with gloves, obviously, and apply heat and
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure and emotion like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could demonstrate right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of where I was going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get a better piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to work too hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do it sit, sit on that, uh,
white, um, what's the little piece here?
[SPEAKER_05]: That lovely set that I made, I want you to
sit near it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pressing hash and knife somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can cut this break, but yeah,
this would be the traditional method.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have more or less a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would put it in, and this is very
traditional because obviously in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the temple ball originates from Nepal
and, uh, and then the Asian continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So traditionally they would take a chunk
and then they would literally do exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you get it into a,
into a homogenized or slightly homogenized
[SPEAKER_02]: state, and you can go like this,
you start doing this motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, if you want to get
spiritual with it, you, you think a
[SPEAKER_02]: little, a little bit about good things and
you hope.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those good intentions get
translated into your, your ball of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really the best balls are made with,
you know, quite a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guys who get really good at this,
you know, get, get calluses and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when doing 200 of these a day,
you end up really, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: exerting yourself and there you end up
with a temple ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's essentially it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the temple ball is, uh,
it's probably the main way we produce,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, all of our press material.
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more, we're going to start doing
Moroccan style.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just having gotten there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moroccan style would be this brick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially you're seeing two different
press methods, but you're in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you break that into one gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the break, you would cut it into six
quarters right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we just released purple cream to
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's an example of that process has
bricks.
[SPEAKER_04]: As brick and then cut into gram squares.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so you said the brick is more
Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the temple ball?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nepalese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally from Nepal, from the Hindu
mountains, from Afghanistan, that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: area does temple balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but again, traditionally they're not
using water and ice to get their
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using dry six.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're getting the freshest tricones
off the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pressing them as quickly and
especially as they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas we use cold water and ice to
extract and then sitting process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we press that process product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a slight difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you think more people in Morocco and
Nepal are going to start doing bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they already are in this plate
technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and I wish I was up to speed
on exactly what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not, but I've been hearing
rumblings about this new technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the plate technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I, I I'm assuming it's dry sip
on the large plate with heat or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, allows you to probably do
it more quickly, larger amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, the, the problem with
the cold water extraction is you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: make ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you still looking for your knife?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So did you take the brick out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little brick, little brickola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this hash wasn't a very oily hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can already see this is a much
oilier product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much, much, much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's determined by the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a cured product.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been curing for a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a massive amount of people who want
buttered products.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just buttered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The oil is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been buttered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because now I have all
these traditional Arabs from Saudi Arabia
[SPEAKER_02]: and now they're getting used to this
buttered stuff because the reality is,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll see right now, I can exemplify
it perfectly, is the reality is when it
[SPEAKER_02]: butters as opposed to a super oily
product, it's really easy to, to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to distribute into whatever, whatever
method you're trying to distribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine if I buy this gram,
for example, from Cali Hash, and I'm a
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco smoker of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had this temple ball, I got to sit
there and I got a big little chunks off
[SPEAKER_02]: and eventually I'll get there or I can buy
this and just crumble it and it's buttered
[SPEAKER_02]: and it has super 600, 600 milligrams of
cannabinoids just like the other one and
[SPEAKER_02]: it butters and it crumbles the same and
I'm getting the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crumbling right on your little pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, more and more I'm in
demand for these.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually the pre-roll rolls better because
there's more air in between.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then look, if you have a lighter,
if you could throw me a lighter,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, check on one of those shelves over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's oil immediately and
it does, you know, it'll, it'll oil up
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing that I've
actually never talked about really with
[SPEAKER_02]: you, Peter, is the, the whole origin of
the bubble, the name bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it all comes from the fact
that it bubbles when you put a lighter to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and that was literally the
age old test and I've been buying hash for
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 plus years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the age old test is to stick a lighter
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got bubbles, you got oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't got bubbles, you got plant
material and fiber and your average hash
[SPEAKER_02]: that's made from dry sift out of the
traditional markets is between,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 30 and 40 percent, 50 percent
oil, if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our high end California made stuff
is in the, you know, 50s to 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your premium 710 labs,
fresh frozen whole plant stuff is getting
[SPEAKER_02]: 85 and above.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so there really is the full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of qualities and resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And resin counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about how many heads can you
successfully get off the plant without
[SPEAKER_02]: taking plant material with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the whole goal of hash making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting resin glands off the plant without
taking plant material with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this hash, you know, some people
might say, oh, that looks kiffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually an oil buttered product,
just like how wax will butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it doesn't, the oil is not
speaking to the oil content.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put a lighter to this, it
immediately butters and immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting a close up of this,
Peter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bubbling, you know that and that's
bubble hash, you know, for it to bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: that it needs the bubble to be called
bubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that, was that just lying around that
little temple ball?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just made this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you did out of what?
[SPEAKER_06]: From that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see there's actually a little
more bubble going on on this one,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we probably assumed because the oil
content looks like a little higher,
[SPEAKER_02]: but same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also a cured product.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these are cured and as they cure,
they butter more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the natural process of oil as it
dries.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to do it one more
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So give me one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this is that product that we,
we already kind of broke up over here and
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do a bit more to exemplify.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all of a sudden when you have a
buttered product, it becomes a lot easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to mess with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, someone who's smoking a few
joints a day of hash, especially the
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco smokers and there's a lot of those
traditional hash people love to mix it
[SPEAKER_02]: with tobacco and it does go good together.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you put a lighter to it and you
can really see that the oil content is
[SPEAKER_02]: there as much as you can say it looks like
a drier product or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just buttered and the oil content is
just hidden.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we mean by buttered?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Buttered is, you know, it comes from wax
terminology and wax is butane made
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens with a stabilized wax
product is the hydrocarbons in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all the fats they butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, the cells open and the actual
structure and this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: very rudimentary chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual structure itself changes and
that product process, what you end up with
[SPEAKER_02]: is a creamy product that isn't crystal or
clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: All oils will eventually do that
regardless.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even olive oil eventually does
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or if you add, if you add oxygen
to it, you can whip oils in the same sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of process happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can butter an MCT oil by just
homogenizing and adding air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, since when you refer to it in
extracts, you're referring to the process
[SPEAKER_02]: of it going from a very clear waxy product
to a creamier looking product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for hash, it's when it goes from that
dark, oily, sticky hash that you can't get
[SPEAKER_02]: off your fingers to something that you can
literally pick up, grab a corner of and go
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you still have your 600, 700
milligrams in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and more and more it's ironic
because at first people always refer to
[SPEAKER_02]: this as the traditional hash or oilier
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I want the oilier stuff and
the stuff that looks oilier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, more often than not I get
people coming back and they'll be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the ease of this one is actually
getting me to like this one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, any other day,
you want to satisfy everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to replicate the people that
came before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Nepalese style.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Moroccan style.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, you know, we do it in a
modern way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what will you use in your pre-rolls?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-rolls, we will use either a butter
product or a raw vacuum freezer product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we use the vacuum freezer,
for our curing process, everything you see
[SPEAKER_02]: here right now is cured in the traditional
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now doing that gives you more higher
levels of certain cannabinoids that we
[SPEAKER_02]: love.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it actually depletes the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't love flavors?
[SPEAKER_02]: And flavors also have effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're preserving the original
terpene profile in some of our raw line,
[SPEAKER_02]: we use a vacuum freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones, it's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you see that is very white,
very clear, not oxidized.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is vacuum frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it's still wet by the water,
because it's water extracted, and you cure
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the natural process in the
atmosphere, you're allowing that water to
[SPEAKER_02]: oxidize the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it changes the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes the structure of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually creates CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes more than that, THCV,
a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the things that people associate
with hash and its effects are those
[SPEAKER_02]: changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor, you lose the terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get actually that one hashing
terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it sounds crazy, but there is a
terpene called hashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that flavor, that earthy flavor,
because I really have a hard time
[SPEAKER_02]: describing it as anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly earthy and barnyardy in a
good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's hashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will, even if you start with,
in my experience, if you start with a
[SPEAKER_02]: super terpy hash that's fruity,
and it has those really prominent either
[SPEAKER_02]: citric or fruity notes, you see the
cherry, those ones that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: prominent.
[SPEAKER_02]: After six months of curing, it'll be
replaced by hashing by that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your age product almost always turns into
that super hashing, heavy CBN glistening,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost starting to crystallize in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that is the joy of this product,
is that it always changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one didn't come out as good as I was
hoping.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it was buttered product.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you mean by as good?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean like visually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, you know, even me,
even though I get actually more orders for
[SPEAKER_02]: this now, I'm still, you know,
in my heart, I just love how it looks when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's dripping, you know, like that
oiliness.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how does this go out onto the market?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it in chunks or do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were making it for Cali Hash in the
lab, we would slice it and then turn it
[SPEAKER_02]: into small little gram squares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or temple balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: To date, we've predominantly done temple
balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is a temple ball like this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like still this color?
[SPEAKER_06]: And this can succeed by the temple ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right now, a lot of our product
will take it to market and it'll be super
[SPEAKER_02]: oily and glistening, but just by the
natural process, especially if it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: summer and the dispensary is hot or the
distribution didn't have a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a direct route or something, you know,
there's always these instances where the
[SPEAKER_02]: product will butter in the process of
getting to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, generally speaking,
we like to get the oiliest product out,
[SPEAKER_02]: the freshest product out, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately for six months, we didn't
have a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up until a month ago, we were wounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just working off of old
inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to anybody out there who didn't love
our product in the last six months,
[SPEAKER_02]: we apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's only going to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're just the little guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we appreciate the little guy support,
you know, but being the little guy means
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have your own lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You found another lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're good now, but it's just,
it's the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Fred loves the, uh, the rosin press,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Fred is going to be our rosin presser.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to do, uh, we're doing,
we're launching rosin in January with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-roll line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both things are being launched at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, right now, I mean, we in fact are
testing some of, uh, we can test right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, some of Fred's product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking on it all week or
actually a couple of weeks now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the purple cream that's currently
in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy this product in the
dispensary, um, the, the, the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we pressed it ourselves in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you can press it at home with
the heat press from your wife,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's a whole different tutorial
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just, uh, you can just look at me
smoking it, but that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very nice, you know, a beige
generally with hash rosin, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a slightly darker color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this was cured in a vacuum freezer,
all of our hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cured in the vacuum freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do it any other traditional way
because during the cure, during the
[SPEAKER_02]: pressing process of rosin, you're getting
those cannabinoids that you want anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with rosin, what we really are aiming
for is flavor profile over everything
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's, um, just so deliciously
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with our raw line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with our press line, we're really
going after those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really trying to, you know,
eventually we'll be, we'll be releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: aged things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one year, two year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Focusing on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the raw line really focuses on
terpium profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like rosin is hot right now, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, you can finish that actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the rosin and the sauces, the part of
the process is a lot of cold curing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to do diamonds, we have to cold
cure and we'll be doing all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the purple cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: We currently have a pressed version and a
raw version, but you can buy that at the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispenser and at home, you can press it
and we're getting 60% out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now in the market, you can,
it's hard to find a good gram of rosin for
[SPEAKER_02]: less than 60, 70 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so buying a gram of Cali hash for 30
bucks, um, pressing it at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait till we release the rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll release it in January.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be price competitive too,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try to bring in as low as
possible as always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we are not about gouging.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not about, we're not here to make
profits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't answer to shareholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not answering to some million dollar
fund.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a more labor intensive process,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that reason, we have to charge
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what I can always assure you is
that we are charging the minimal possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never paid myself a salary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I pay my employees well and we take
care of them because they're very
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, none of the partners
who started the business have ever looked
[SPEAKER_02]: at a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and, and we're not looking
at it as a, as a, as a piggy bank or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or some sort of revenue generator.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're in it to build a really
reliable brand longterm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take it very seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm a very emotional person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you send that my way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a very emotional person.
[SPEAKER_06]: When did you decide you wanted to do go?
[SPEAKER_06]: That route, which route would that be like
established Cali hash because you've been
[SPEAKER_06]: three years ago for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three years ago, I came up with the name
Cali hash and started the branding of Cali
[SPEAKER_06]: hash itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but like four years ago, did you say,
I know I'm going to, I want to go down.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's my shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like, when you go to a camera
store, they have like a little display
[SPEAKER_05]: where you can see the different cameras.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me try to clean this for Peter or
magnificent Peter who is handling the
[SPEAKER_02]: camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a rosin made by our in-house
hashashin maker named Fred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is made from our purple cream
product or raw purple cream product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has just a very, very fruity finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of cherry going along, a lot of
berries going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just place it inside our lovely
puff go peak for a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw that on top of there and then pass
it to the cameraman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think once it hits up, it doesn't do
that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's working.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I was always, I was always
against wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never dabbed until I realized there was
a solventless, uh, until you could really
[SPEAKER_02]: take solventless to this extreme level
that now I realize you can take it to
[SPEAKER_02]: anything you can make with the butane
hexane alcohol product, distillate
[SPEAKER_02]: included.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a brave new world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: To start it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how to do the buttons on this
whole time?
[SPEAKER_02]: You do it three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a twice or three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a quick double.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong work, Fred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I actually have some examples of
some other stuff that Fred pressed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, when you press a cured hash
product, you end up with a much more
[SPEAKER_02]: oxidized end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it aesthetically pleasing to the
average smoker in the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be darker, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, where did these things go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple grams in here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do what we want with these here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very dark product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a hash rosin made with,
I think it was actually made with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like drinking your coffee black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this will be very high in CBN and then
it'd be incredibly high in hasheen,
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpene hasheen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to knock you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would knock you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, other than the intense hash
flavor, which hasheen is, gives you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's probably my favorite thing
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is it super enjoyable in terms of
like fruity profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you like the flavor, if you like
the flavor of a good old shoe,
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you like, you know, this type of
cured hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would dream about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why when I met Frenchie again
after, cause I thought I would never
[SPEAKER_06]: experience the taste of that old Lebanese
hash again, which I did when I was young.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love it still.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would prefer it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is this made differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference, that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it was more CBN than I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference is that with the
purple cream, actually I have both next to
[SPEAKER_02]: each other right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the purple cream on the right here,
on this side, you have, it's done with the
[SPEAKER_02]: mole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done with the vacuum freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this never oxidized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trichome, even up to the point of
pressing, never oxidized.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff or this stuff on the other
side, the same as this, this is done with
[SPEAKER_02]: a cured product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the beginning product of this middle
one was white.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy our purple cream raw right now
is white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the mimosa that you have at home
right now that you probably don't like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that one in the beginning was white.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the dates on it,
that was produced I think a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we've had such issues in the
last six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, again, I extend my
apologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is maybe me reading into it,
but I got one complaint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I take it very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one complaint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said that they actually really was
displeased with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually the mimosa they
mentioned in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was about three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to speak to you on this,
Peter, because I took it so badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it floored me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take this incredibly seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my passion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's only going to get better is my
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even today on what Fred was packaging,
I was really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a cured product where the
heads were all obvious, where you could
[SPEAKER_02]: see each head individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did the traditional cure on this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we left it in raw form.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can actually see every head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've all oxidized a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have that beautiful profile and
that glisten.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, some of our stuff was kiffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is literally the word the person
used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, isn't there a part of this where you
go, the way we make our heads,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not a uniform process.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's artisanal as artisanal can be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're obviously going for
consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to only get better.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in an artisanal process, that happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens with wine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we are the little guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're only going to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives us a trajectory as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to give a nod to Nascha.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a nod to 710 Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're companies that are doing
exceptional work in the self and the
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're companies that I aspire to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no problem to admit that,
Frenchy included.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm happy to be part of this
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solventless forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got those cookies solventless
products that we saw at... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, I need to get some from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you partake?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: What product did they use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a rosin?
[SPEAKER_05]: So Adu, Blue Ice Tech on Instagram,
who came over from Spain to basically run
[SPEAKER_05]: their solventless.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was experimenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had the History of Rosin event
where he brought his first product that
[SPEAKER_05]: he's like, it's like different
consistencies, different textures,
[SPEAKER_05]: different processes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a picture of them somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see what they look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's a pneumatic...
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually just a hydraulic welded
bottle jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is originally a bottling jack that's
been retrofitted by an industrious person
[SPEAKER_02]: who sells them on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: For very specific purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're definitely... This is all fun
and games, but in the lab under the keen
[SPEAKER_02]: eye of BCC and in laboratory conditions,
it all changes quite dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use anything with this kind of
paint on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're required to test everything every
step of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a different, different environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is still fun to see hash in
abundance and free in the wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roaming, pouncing around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows up in Christmas scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been wanting to do this the entire
time I've been sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is other hash that we have here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is... This one is AF,
which is not as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is one of our more popular
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people really clamor for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an age old favorite for any hash
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to prop it up over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can put this lighter in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a nice little chunk of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what is that chunk of hash's destiny?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will all be sold to medical
licensed medical individuals in the state
[SPEAKER_02]: of California, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are some lucky patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There still are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: With the prices as they are in
dispensaries, I'm glad to still satisfy
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the medical market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I truly believe, and even in Cali
Hash's case, we try our hardest to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: price as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very candid about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our price to the wholesaler is $12.50,
including distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after that point to the retailer,
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's to the distributor we sell it
for $12.50.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're selling it to the retailer at
$12.50, all included.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the lowest we can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a company, we're only getting $10 of
every unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that $10, $2 goes to legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: $4 goes to biomass to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's $2 left to go to the
packager.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, as a company, we're not even
making a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not our goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to establish a reliable,
trustworthy brand that says something,
[SPEAKER_02]: that stands for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, before I get too romantic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it would be nice if you didn't
have to deal with all that stuff you were
[SPEAKER_05]: making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if I could pay myself a salary,
it would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could just upgrade any business in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, again, like a week ago,
this was incredibly oily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably my oiliest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't get your hands off it without
it being sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, it's completely buttered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the air and oxygen does that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in this case, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That didn't seem to take long.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this actually, like I said,
about two weeks ago, this looked entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: like that glistening part, but everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, more glistening than these.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually the more oily, you know,
my... And we did not oil these up like
[SPEAKER_05]: bikini models.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one, I mean, this one will even
melt even more, and it's even more
[SPEAKER_02]: buttery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This really speaks to what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you really just, it opens itself
up, and you end up with this really
[SPEAKER_02]: fluffy, creamy, yet melty, and extremely
bubbly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can just, you can see it just
melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more oily the product, the faster it
does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that's, I would reckon that's
between 70 and 75% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the smell?
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, when you're speaking about
the 70 and 60 and 50%- Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're speaking of the ratio between the
plant material left in the end product and
[SPEAKER_02]: the oil content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little bit of plant material is not
a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a believer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Rosin, and we're really happy to
launch Rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'm a newly converted dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to always make fun of all you
dabbers out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm like dab all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Fred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he started pressing my own stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's definitely,
you know, I'm very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a little bit of phytoplankton,
a little bit of plant fiber, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of that stuff in the plant is truly full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really are talking about a full
spectrum product that truly reflects the
[SPEAKER_02]: original plant, but is an extract,
cold water extraction is the closest
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're doing it at those high
levels of whole plant, fresh frozen,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're really getting an 85% cannabinoid
with a 15% plant material and lipid and
[SPEAKER_02]: fat bilayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really is the, for me,
is the Holy Grail Coup de Grace,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that where you have to get the tops of
the plants and freeze them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Immediately?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you been doing for the past
hour?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use, and you have to use
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we want to use the bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have to freeze it immediately
or a flash freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just stick wet plants in a freezer,
it just takes the tricone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think like a tricone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people do that, don't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, get a life.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if you're really doing fresh frozen,
you're at least spending $40,000 on your
[SPEAKER_02]: blast freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you ensure that that's being
done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a nitrogen machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you ensure that's being done?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go to their facility and look.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never take anyone's word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you take fresh frozen... And
that's only the tops, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it can be anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's very important is the speed of
freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you allow the tricone to sit in
a state of half frozen, half wet,
[SPEAKER_02]: it becomes like a little dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that frozen tricone... I don't
know why it's going this way, but you want
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really do, and you want the stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then when you're cutting the stalk
off of the plant, it has that stem to
[SPEAKER_02]: break.
[SPEAKER_02]: The minute you've mashed the tricone head
against the plant material, against the
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber of the plant, then it's a whole
nother challenge to get it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, in my experience,
actually, the best stuff isn't made with
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made with fresh, fresh period.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally go to your garden,
cut the plant, throw it in your process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight to hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you get is incredible results.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drip, drip, drip.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has to be gotten there at the right
time, with the most resin in there,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's really a lot of nuance to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, when you harvest a plant...
And I love to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think like the tricone, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little zen with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the tricone, even on the plant,
if you harvest a plant a month
[SPEAKER_02]: prematurely, you're getting none of the
cannabinoids you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's begin there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a whole different type of
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why some people say, that's why
they say the plant literally tells them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when a grower is looking for those
amber-headed, and I think the average
[SPEAKER_02]: grower says between 60 and 70% amber at
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree, that's probably the optimal
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that amberine, what they're
speaking to is the creation of THCV,
[SPEAKER_02]: of CBN, of those cannabinoids that we all
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it becomes a full spectrum
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of your hash that's made with these
premature materials, or let me refer to
[SPEAKER_02]: the wax market.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened a lot in the wax market,
and this can be corroborated by anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: who's been in the traditional market for a
long time, Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would literally take premature plants
and blast them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would end up with this white,
clear product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically trying to get tricone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blast them with what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blasting refers to the process of butane,
the butane extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would blast them with butane and
use butane extraction to end up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: clear end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you're ending up with is a one
mono-cannabinoid product, because none of
[SPEAKER_02]: the other cannabinoids have developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a bit of a trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's this universal idea,
and it even falls on me, that the cleaner,
[SPEAKER_02]: clearer the product, the cleaner or better
the product, the less oxidized the
[SPEAKER_02]: product, the better the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am gonna make it my life's mission to
re-educate the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the best cannabinoids are the
oxidized ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxygen is an incredible thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives us life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows for all of this mammal,
fully-bodied reptilian and mammalian life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allowed for all the evolution,
as you know it, from the smallest things
[SPEAKER_02]: to become the biggest things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the most toxic element,
one of the most toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxidization, what that refers to is how on
the atomic level, oxygen has one
[SPEAKER_02]: free-floating electron on its outer ring
by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So literally, any other molecule,
or any atom, excuse me, that has any space
[SPEAKER_02]: on its outer ring for that one molecule,
that one electron to go into, it bonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what erosion is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what oxidization is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxygen, ironically, because it gives us
life, is one of the most toxic elements on
[SPEAKER_02]: the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting irony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it comes to cannabinoids,
it is our releaser, it is our natural
[SPEAKER_02]: nature's laboratory of creating those
cannabinoids that we all love and hold
[SPEAKER_02]: dear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxidization is not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it get such a bad rap?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: BHO did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it because there is a thing with
freshness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also can cause wax to sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of oxidization, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't want your wax to sugar or
butter, like we referred to before,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the nascent wax market, we're talking
2007.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to shatter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what happened to shatter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this sauce now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what the true story of that is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatter is a longer process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatter involves ovens that are more
costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually much cheaper to make sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually just, people just convincing
the market they want sauce because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, bless them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make shatter without an oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier to screw up shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harder to get a stable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much easier to make a sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say, I'd like to thank the
three of you for coming to my impromptu
[SPEAKER_05]: holiday party.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we wrap it up, yeah, Peter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do want to get stills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you do that sort of smoking out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because you want, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has some stills in no quasars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the stuff that we use to smoke
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure a bong is not traditional for
most hash smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why don't you sit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe, you get in that dude thing,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can show us how you smoke out of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Cali Hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too big for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit on Cali Hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a bottle at least?
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it next to you somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put it next to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This we may or may not make more of.
[SPEAKER_03]: As of now, this is one of one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone that sees it does seem to
like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the prototype.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prototype Cali Hash pillow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be yours for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I've made a few prototype
things for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Mike's got our towel.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Andy's holding a one of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, one of one beautiful iPhone case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: If this pillow goes viral, you can auction
it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_06]: If that goes viral, that pillow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well we need to live stream like a
home shopping network of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to smoke with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine if you could sell interstate like
home shopping network.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be like, today on the show, we have some
amazing outdoor humble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's all really about curating then.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Curating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: And California is the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in this country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Careful saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful saying that in other states.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got I got I got girl friends all over
the country and the one thing that pisses
[SPEAKER_03]: them off.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like we can't help it because we
didn't create our.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even they know it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what pisses them off.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't create our stigma.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who visited here created the
stigma and took it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But wait, what's the stigma?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like California, in terms of being a
pinnacle in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, stigma sounds bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't like the opposite of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Positive reputation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss using the word a little bit,
but it's still, I guess, applicable.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's yeah, it's reputation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing is, is that like,
yes, we know Maine has a very respectable
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis culture going back many years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And fine growers and a real caregiver
community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just as the industry ramps up,
you know, people want a piece of that
[SPEAKER_06]: California manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm packing a little bit of a.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just no tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: No tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a well-known cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just called Scout Cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just one of the countless
crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the countless crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crosses and crosses and crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So put a little bit of flour on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who grew this?
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine grew this.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really pleased to meet you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea who Callie Hash was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like the bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was worried that you were just like,
you know, cashing in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it as cheaply as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because I had never heard,
you know, you know, and just like with a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of other people in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really, really great to see that
you are very, not only passionate,
[SPEAKER_06]: but knowledgeable about the different
processes and incorporating them into what
[SPEAKER_06]: you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you really care about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that you have the legacy and
tradition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is Grape Ape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very turpy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I usually tell people,
especially people who who haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking hash in years or people who are
flour people who are looking to extend
[SPEAKER_03]: their flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pair a gram of hash with about an
eighth of flour, that gram, if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking the hash every time you smoke your
flour, you may have a little bit of hash
[SPEAKER_03]: left over at the end of your eighth,
but you should about, they should about
[SPEAKER_03]: finish around the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you pair those together,
it should make your eighth for however
[SPEAKER_03]: long an eighth lasts here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should make your eighth last about
twice as long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're getting a $30 gram,
then you're normally smoking $40 eighths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're saving 10 bucks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I usually tell people if they want
to smoke it with a bong is all they got to
[SPEAKER_03]: do is take, you know, really tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you can put as much as you
want on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.1.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're, if you're, if you're trying
to just put it on your bong and have a
[SPEAKER_03]: nice little snap, small amount of weed on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, again, you can fill it to the brim
if you'd like, but I like to taste my
[SPEAKER_03]: flour and taste my hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make smaller bowls and just pack it
more often.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be the same for a pipe or any
bowl that you're?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people like to pack them big
because they like to pass it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the West Coast is a snap.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a snap country.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like snaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really degrades the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an East Coast thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you appreciate the flavor,
you know, different generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was more communal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would share a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in Western United States where we
do snaps.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I was younger, we also had,
we did pinners, just a one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had these little one pinner,
little, little pipes that were incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: All you could fit in there was that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't actually, I have a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a box of chillums.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do those chillums to people for free
when we do, when we show up to
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these branded?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we won't.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will have them branded.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're really, they're just simple
one-hitters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect for if you reload and just
hashing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put flour to before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chillums are very hash-friendly aren't
they?
[SPEAKER_06]: Original hash is the original hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke a real hash and add flour
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you just plain it with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to put like four grams
to get it going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so cheap that like, it's worth it
getting a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you get a handful of them,
you can just leave one or two of them
[SPEAKER_03]: soaking in alcohol while you have your one
that you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way you always have plenty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in a gym that has like all the combs
and they're in soaking in alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or like a barber in their combs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Locker room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, since they're so cheap,
if you break it, who cares if you break
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so when you smoke this,
just smoke it like any other bolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hand them that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, if that one's jammed up though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one needs a little love,
but you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here's more of a traditional show.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just throw things out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing though, this is going to take a
lot more money to pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five to ten grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a one hitter is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is something you share with
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the same man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's actually halfway between the
Quasar and like a one hitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quasar is like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the Quasar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it just.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's next to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Show what we still have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the thing is, like the Quasar,
even though you could pack the hell out of
[SPEAKER_03]: this and pass around a billion people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could just keep it for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash holds it very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be fully sealed off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could hit this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cherry goes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can snuff the cherry with some
glass or a dish and then leave it on your
[SPEAKER_03]: desk or whatever and get back to it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about traditional Quasar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we had this last time we were using
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get very far into the 15 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, part of that had to do with
the fact that we just we weren't we didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have the proper fire to light the coal
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we weren't we weren't starting this
with a proper coal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nonetheless, whether you were or
weren't, and this was something left over
[SPEAKER_03]: from when you were smoking on the hookah,
you could come back to it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, hash holds up very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is this just like a electronic hookah?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is looks electronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you put the coal in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, coal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coal powered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is it is operates just like a
traditional hookah does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the only difference is is their
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried the Quasar tobacco yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it works just fine with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying it with just with hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hash is combustion rate is higher than
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just made for hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: This device is not made for hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I saw people using tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm mistaken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, we're just.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, then we retrofitted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the other way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, using hash with tobacco is a very
Middle East thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mixing one or the other.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can also pack some like strawberry
tobacco and dribble some of the hash on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were to if you were to mix this
with tobacco, it wouldn't be as important
[SPEAKER_03]: to get a really hot coal as it would be if
you're just smoking the hash by itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you're smoking a hash,
you have to use a lot less hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that is 100 percent correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how many people still like to use
hookahs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they still popular?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of a younger demographic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So culture and culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're talking about people who are
like in their 30s and older, I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be more of a foreign foreigner
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people who have friends that are from
foreign cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it comes to the two younger
demographics, very popular across the
[SPEAKER_03]: board.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it, I think, has to do with,
you know, you're giving younger people
[SPEAKER_03]: another place to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some kid just turns 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants he or she wants all the places in
the world to go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's only for 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to experience these new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's very much in line with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tuned out and I tuned back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're saying there are places where an 18
year old can go to smoke hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hookah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hookah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hookah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is and I won't name the hookah
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to burn them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I haven't been there in a few
years, but I used to be friends with the
[SPEAKER_03]: owner and I used to give him hash and he
would keep some for himself and then mix
[SPEAKER_03]: my tobacco for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get everyone in the hookah place
like prairie dog and like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I'm not just.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, you don't know what you're
smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this how you like when you normally
smoke hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how I do it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is number one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like what's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm a California kid and so we
love our bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an East guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my bongs too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Illadelf is an East Coast glass
company, but I'm just saying just it's
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people to own a bong out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm not using a bong, then I'll be
using a dabrig and I'll be smoking rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But across a month, you do it with mostly
the bongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly the bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many dabrig, how many rosin,
second.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll roll it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like with flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And mind you, I smoke a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that and hash and rosins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I like my variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, even though I smoke a bong every
day, I smoke a dab every day, more than
[SPEAKER_03]: one or two of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I roll at least one or two
joints a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are my.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your nightcap?
[SPEAKER_03]: My nightcap?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's.
[SPEAKER_05]: With just flour or flour and hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Both.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flour and hash together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what do you start the day with?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you start and end your day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the easiest and it's the most
efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because with a bong when compared to when
you're rolling joints, you're consuming a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot less.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting the job done with less.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so like if you compare to how you get
from a bong versus a joint, you could
[SPEAKER_03]: probably accomplish something similar to a
joint with like what five or six snaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you were to compare how much
product you're actually consuming in that
[SPEAKER_03]: five or six sass versus what you're
putting into that joint, you're.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally, we would say joints were
for growers and dealers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it really is so inefficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to be able to burn half of
all of your product indiscriminately to do
[SPEAKER_02]: joints every now and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know some joint in blunt smokers
where they won't even smoke the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten to that now where I throw away
half of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, uh, as much as I have,
I prefer the flavor all in the first half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll smoke the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't waste it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's more so I won't waste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you live through the depression.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, but it's really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: A really, really good infused pre-roll or
joint gets better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally improves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, um, I love the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Greg's wife used to make these and they
used to sell them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget what they called them.
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't make them anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's, uh, she's pregnant with twins now,
but hers were killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I used to buy them from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sold them for like 30 bucks and they
would last two or three days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I put it out, but as it burned out,
it totally, and by the end it was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was, hers were a marvel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told her, I'm going, this is what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you know, like, and to fun and
hers were like, they were famous for
[SPEAKER_06]: burning evenly down and then everything
got better.
[SPEAKER_06]: As it got down, I'm like, this thing is a
work of art.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she made each one of them by hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of space for
companies to do this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a real specialized thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like a seasonal thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go, here's the flower, the best,
and here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to only, you know,
and, but next year we'll do some others.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Teaming up with really specific growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Create the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and once you can go direct to people,
you'll be delivering those to people
[SPEAKER_06]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: All see all your true story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fishinado has really done a good job with
theirs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really always, and he's just earning
their trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the way I, here's, here's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you might, you'll appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Few things to talk about last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went up with, with, uh, with my buddy
Brett and to the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, it was a Brett Reisner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there he's actually from the Valley
and, and he, and he was like a kid in a
[SPEAKER_06]: candy shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, the Emerald cup was where
you would, you know, originally,
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's still a bit valid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where the farmers would bring their
roots and artists down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So where else, where else would you be in
one place?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and you know, and so on, and,
and, and he got a whole bunch,
[SPEAKER_06]: he had it all out on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, this, and, and he's like,
jotting everything down and writing it
[SPEAKER_06]: down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically what he was doing was
curating that season's harvest,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever he had gotten, the business model
in there is like totally valid.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get to know someone on the other
side of the world who cannot come and
[SPEAKER_06]: experience that harvest and you learn
about them and you curate before them,
[SPEAKER_06]: say 10, 10, don't get with all your ideas,
Tom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get my ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ideas are ideas begin other ideas,
but anyway, but even if you did that and
[SPEAKER_06]: you were only right with them half the
time, it's part of being a writer,
[SPEAKER_06]: having tons of ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And ideas, I, if you leave ideas,
begin ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you just leave your portal open,
if you can do that, somebody that does
[SPEAKER_03]: develop tons of ideas, it's like,
it can be a tsunami or a snowball.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it just keeps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, if it's a tsunami and a
snowball, then you have to smoke some more
[SPEAKER_06]: hash because you're just, you know,
you don't want to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: so, you know, and, and, and that is,
I mean, I'm not, you have ideas,
[SPEAKER_06]: but get ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a jar I'm reusing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's holding, holding my, uh, my,
my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what flower do you like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, mostly, uh, Indica is an indica
dominant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when I do smoke in a sativa,
typically stuff that's more real dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa, uh, I prefer in concentrate form
over flower form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if I do smoke a straight sativa in
the flower, I actually prefer to mix it
[SPEAKER_03]: with a, with a, with a Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, I really enjoy the mixture of,
uh, Jack Herrera and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those mixed together definitely
compliment each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you, you get that nice mixture of
that citrusy with that earthy tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you doing both of those as flower or
one as flower and one as hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Both as flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Both as flower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, excellent mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to, uh, uh, Wade Louder,
uh, the guy behind Harlequin, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: or Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and he was talking about mixing like
four or five different cultivars to create
[SPEAKER_05]: like his hash or his tinctures that that
was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he, he wants to get somebody as
broad and deep of a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like one cultivar doesn't have
everything or like noticeable amounts of
[SPEAKER_05]: everything, but if you mix a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely prefer it out of all.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you said you liked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mix Jack and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, when I was younger, I was actually
really into mixing flower strains together
[SPEAKER_03]: to just, just mix up the terpene profile
and the flavors of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the only thing that I,
the only thing that I still is,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like, you know how when you
stick a small, a little, a small child in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of like a soda machine and they go
and they get one of everything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with wheat, you know, uh, but the only
thing that I've, I've desired to mix over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years in terms of flower, like the
recent years are, uh, are a sativa with an
[SPEAKER_03]: indica just because it's just,
it's not that I won't, I can't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A sativa straight flower is just,
I don't prefer it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I'm going to smoke sativa
straight, I prefer it as a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then otherwise, like I was saying,
I mix it with an indica or an indica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there particular brands or growers
that you like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I got a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he'll be having his stuff coming out
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he owns America farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always produced good products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but he, he'll have, he'll have some
flower on, on the 64 market, uh,
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's still, uh, dealing with some
stuff, um, in terms of harvest and build
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then this jar I'm reusing is
actually one other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is King's Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to you about them last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I think that, so Hasidic Grapes is the
cut that I was talking about, but from,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and unless I'm wrong on this,
but from what I understand, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause I don't really know these guys
personally is that Hasidic Grapes is from
[SPEAKER_03]: another breeder and that King's Garden,
uh, got it from this breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, otherwise with all intensive
purposes, I think it's their exclusive,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, but it's definitely unique cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just like their product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they make a quality flower and that's
just about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quality and it's not overly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can get a quarter,
like a friend of a friend's company,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, a flower company, they sell,
uh, King's Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, uh, I think they're,
they sell it for like 50 or 60 bucks for a
[SPEAKER_03]: quarter, which is very reasonable in terms
of the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anyone that's been to a
recreational store knows how expensive the
[SPEAKER_03]: product is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that sucks for those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just, that's before you even see
the taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they see the taxes, the first time
it's like, oh, it's like you voted for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're done, when you're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom's still not done.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, by the way, here's this 25
to 45% tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I say the range is so big
is because that doesn't include the taxes
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't see before it even touches
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every level has to deal with major
taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and so the consumer,
obviously the consumer is dealing with
[SPEAKER_03]: major taxes themselves, but they're not
even seeing how much is inflating the
[SPEAKER_03]: price before it even touches them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, that, that information is super
important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, unfortunately it falls back on
the fact that most people just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really like to read stuff and they just,
they go off of what other people say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, but here we are and we're
going to make the industry better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to move forward and hopefully
people will amend 64 a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: More municipalities will get a little
friendlier and move forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to get the state to give back
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: The state is a brutal drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could say that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so, do you, like, Nasher, for
instance, has a relationship with Sunshine
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnson, who's a, a, a driver.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a co-branding it and she grows for
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something of interest to you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when I visited her farm once,
and she has a smaller farm, she's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony, you should do an article on the
rower and the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could think of two or three,
actually three couples that have that
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a really beautiful thing because
they each have their own expertise and
[SPEAKER_06]: they come together and out of that,
they make a totally unique third product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you mean like a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something we definitely discuss.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also known as a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But are there any farms that you guys are
targeting?
[SPEAKER_05]: In particular?
[SPEAKER_02]: We exclusively work with, yeah,
our suppliers are twofold.
[SPEAKER_02]: We exclusively work with Project Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a downtown facility with 850
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: They produce all of genetic, genetic,
Mike genetic, X genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also partnered with a company
up North, a garden that produces in
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we, we try to limit our supply
to one or two only.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of curating growing in the
long run, you know, the, the Holy grail
[SPEAKER_02]: for Cali Hash is to have a vertically
integrated project where we're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: controlling some of our biomass creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to places like Afghanistan
and getting the actual strings that we
[SPEAKER_02]: want and then producing things from a
vertically controlled nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even once we get the land race though,
we still want to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the, the other cuts and whatnot that,
that are, that we produce in California
[SPEAKER_03]: and other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we definitely want to have a line
that's, that's land race.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so where in California would you
want to grow to mimic Afghanistan?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, unless you're up North and
the best hash is still made in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: ways up North in California, you have to
just have a very controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have a controlled room
where you can probably, you want it to
[SPEAKER_05]: come closest to giving those Afghani land
races, probably grass valley at 6,000 feet
[SPEAKER_02]: north of Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just, it's not just Afghani land
races though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's other land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that said, it would be easier to
control the indoor environment to have
[SPEAKER_03]: those different, you know, to accommodate
those different land races.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the outdoor environment, so I actually
have this, if you did the entire U S would
[SPEAKER_05]: that would grass valley kind of still be
the closest to Afghanistan?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Wisconsin or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I want to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wisconsin and mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of the things I've come to
appreciate between the different methods
[SPEAKER_02]: of growing and what that does to our end
product is hash makers is that with
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor product and the full spectrum from
the sun, when you're using the full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum from the sun, you essentially,
your trichomes, they develop in a
[SPEAKER_02]: different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, unfortunately the best hash
is usually made from greenhouse full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum solar, uh, grown flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big proponent of soil grown and,
and, and greenhouse grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using full full sun spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's nothing better now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get close to it indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you make amazing hash within the
mortar and material?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we get from two sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is an indoor source project cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second one is, uh, it's actually
have Patrick's project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick is corner of green goddess and
tied 99 and, uh, and Melrose.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also has a bunch of weed brands,
including tiny trees and Shiloh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get all of our bio, a lot of our
biomass from them, from tiny trees and
[SPEAKER_02]: Shiloh and project cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, we're talking with wonder
bread right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where that leads.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're always looking for
whoever, whoever's popular, whoever's
[SPEAKER_02]: creating the best flower to partner with
and do collabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, we're definitely, we're doing a
loaded collab right now at the same time
[SPEAKER_02]: as our pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to, but loaded is this
company that does very high end pre-rolls,
[SPEAKER_02]: one and a half grams, you know,
glass 40, $50 a piece, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we'll let them do a little Cali hash
collab while we release our, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the people joints and don't grow
specifically for you loaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we'll partner with different growers
to get the biomass for that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even for the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but long-term, like if sunshine is
going, she's going, this is my hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and that's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's certain strains that are
just so complimentary and Afghan is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever I can find Afghan biomass,
even if it's not from one of my sources
[SPEAKER_02]: that grows it for me, I'll usually jump on
it because I just want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing, a lot of people don't
know and realize that one of the parents
[SPEAKER_02]: of gorilla glue, so GG four, which is
incredibly popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So daddy of GG four, is Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want Afghani without getting
Afghani, just get GG four and you
[SPEAKER_02]: basically have something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a very similar profile,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that's why I love gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds you of growing up in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strains from Morocco, yeah,
there's the Moroccan, when we were kids,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was ketama, K-E-T-A-M-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the strains that grew a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of stuff that came out of
Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you go to Morocco, in the Rift
Mountains, it's cookies and OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon, this, I mean, even stuffed
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever been to Portugal?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the different clubs, but they can't
sell the one another, so every club has to
[SPEAKER_06]: make its own product?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just like in Amsterdam,
it's very gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Holland, there's this similar laws
where you have to, it's just creates an
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly gray mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like California circa 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of do it, but it's not really
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyone that was around California
2000, that's exactly what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, those were good days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they sure were.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to drink this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was very, very educational.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to the photo shoot next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll do more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, I appreciate, we'll get
different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get 50 grams, 10 of like the
best black, the best blonde, the best red,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best brown, the best cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have five shades.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what are you looking for from the
shots?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking for product shots?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking for the sexy shades?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Nacho, they have 11,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a thousand because I post shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, gotcha.
Help.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
