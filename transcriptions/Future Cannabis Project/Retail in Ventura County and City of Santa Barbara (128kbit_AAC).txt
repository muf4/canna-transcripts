[SPEAKER_00]: In retail right now, there's probably only
about 800 plus retail permits issued by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state thought that they would have
almost 3,000 retail locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't have as many places for
cultivators or manufacturers to put their
[SPEAKER_00]: products in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, there's been somewhat of a
fallout of people expecting this market to
[SPEAKER_00]: literally right at the get-go be a booming
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We each have our own set of struggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the retail area, mainly it's the
resistance that cities and counties are
[SPEAKER_00]: not writing rules or regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they hang their hat on a
California Supreme Court ruling saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that locales can, in fact, ban or put a
moratorium in place at locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently, only 20% of the California
cities are actually opening up their
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delivery was another issue where delivery,
you had to have either a retail storefront
[SPEAKER_00]: or a warehouse to originate from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state says basically you could
deliver across any city property line.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm in Ventura County,
a very hostile county.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chief of police of Ventura,
who is named as Ken Corny, he told me in a
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting about two years ago that 2019 and
2020 would be the most profitable year for
[SPEAKER_00]: his police department for civil
forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's looking like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ventura, Oxnard, and the 10 cities inside
Ventura, only two have opened up their
[SPEAKER_00]: hearts to offer cannabis as an access
portal, either delivery or retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Ojai and Port Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next city that's going to open up is
going to be Oxnard, with six permits this
[SPEAKER_00]: year, maybe two more the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ventura still has not opened up the
conversation, and I'm not sure whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they ever will because of the embedded
Republican conservative party against just
[SPEAKER_00]: say no to drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have raised already about four and a
half million dollars for a legal war chest
[SPEAKER_00]: to challenge the state act of banning at
city and county level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a vast legal background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raided in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, raided in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took 21 months to get out of that mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically they threw every felony
count they could think of against me and
[SPEAKER_00]: spent five days in jail, 44 felony counts,
mandatory 63 years, and every count was
[SPEAKER_00]: dismissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if I was going to get a fair
trial in Ventura County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We changed our corporation from a not for
profit, which is what almost all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations were in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when AB 266 came out, we basically did
not want to rewrite the rules of land use
[SPEAKER_00]: and zoning laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they basically wanted you to convert to
a full for profit corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now that as Shangri-La care centers
within us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've merged with two other states with
multiple permit holders when the gauntlet
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Federal Control Substance Act
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be opening up centers not only
in California, but in other states,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico, Arizona and also Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we will have a micro license.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Ohio is authorized that we
will have a micro which will allow us to
[SPEAKER_00]: add manufacturing and also distributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could add only four licenses under
type 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me kind of the State of the Union of
Santa Barbara City retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just opened up the pharmacy,
which is the first 21 plus adult used
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary in the history of Santa
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a hometown Santa Barbara boy,
that was a pretty fun thing for me to put
[SPEAKER_02]: in the books.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a three permits total for the
entire city, which, you know, 45 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: from Santa Barbara to Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically it's the only three
dispensaries within a 45 minute radius in
[SPEAKER_02]: any direction that are adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually, you know, pretty big
deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, you know, the response
from the community in Santa Barbara has
[SPEAKER_02]: been amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to the to the point that I had
somebody at a restaurant buy me lunch to
[SPEAKER_02]: thank us for what we've done because she
uses it as a medical treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was driving, you know,
to Port Waineme or L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: or Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, you know, a long drive and
now she can she can find it in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she really appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's an interesting micro
example of the macro process that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on, which is, you know, I think the state
vastly underestimated the friction that
[SPEAKER_02]: was created with a dual layer licensing
policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Prop 64 was voted on two and a
half years ago, went into effect in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Barbara is a progressive city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the process of writing
those local regulations, just a month ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: two and you know, two years after Prop 64
went into effect, basically, we got our
[SPEAKER_02]: first dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's part of, you know,
you're seeing that at a statewide level.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, six hundred and
thirteen dispensaries that are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have their doors open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adult use, you know, Prop 64 dispensaries
in Colorado, Washington and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a dispensary for every five
thousand people in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a dispensary for every thirty
five thousand people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did the math, California should
have probably, you know, seven to nine
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand dispensaries right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a tenth of that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, you know, I should say
they have the six thousand dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just 80 percent of them are
unlicensed illicit market dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the legal side, on the license side,
you've got a tenth of the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: that we should have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the stats, 2018 was
actually a contraction in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis sales were less in 2018 than
2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's come back now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was basically the opposite of
what everyone thought was going to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: with Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it was going to be a huge,
immediate booming market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is, you know, 60 percent of
counties and cities aren't allowing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 40 percent that are,
it's taking them years to write the
[SPEAKER_02]: ordinances and go through a permitting
process that ends up eventually,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Santa Barbara, you know, two and a
half years later that we finally open the
[SPEAKER_02]: doors and the public has, you know,
safe legal access again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been really interesting to watch
how things got tighter, not looser with
[SPEAKER_02]: the Prop 64 so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for me, Santa Barbara city issued
three permits, three for medical and three
[SPEAKER_00]: for recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And does the county have any dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the county has zero dispensaries open
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just my bafflement, Santa Barbara
County, the most row operations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire, producing the most wheat in all of
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, and by the way,
we're not going to have any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit more nuance that they will
have retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the process of writing these
local ordinances, it's very different than
[SPEAKER_02]: like, for example, in Nevada, where the
state said, OK, it's legal in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the rule in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it's here's the state rules up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all that is predicated on
municipalities, city and counties down
[SPEAKER_02]: below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for Santa Barbara County, for example,
just decided a month ago that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to switch from a lottery process for
awarding the eight permits that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have to a merit based process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will now take them six to nine
months to debate what the merit based
[SPEAKER_02]: process looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they'll put that in the ordinance and
then they'll have, you know, three to six
[SPEAKER_02]: month window to submit your applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll have a three to nine
month application analysis process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll issue the permits and
then you'll take six months to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: building permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll take six months to do your
your build out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those Santa Barbara County dispensaries
that will come, you know, that's a twenty,
[SPEAKER_02]: twenty one, twenty, twenty two prospect
before a customer walks in the door,
[SPEAKER_02]: which again, I think is that, you know,
that really interesting thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: California is on one hand the most
interesting and biggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 27 percent of the national market.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, it is the most immature
because of the way that they set the
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing up and how slow the process is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, again, if Colorado decides
California to be nine thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries, California has six hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a slow process for the
next two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of you kind of have lottery tickets,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have, you know, three or six
maybe in total in Europe and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have three in Ojai allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me let me share something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hat is off to him because even though
he's a competitor of mine and has helped
[SPEAKER_00]: or basically I've lost a little bit of my
retail market because he's open now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me tell you, the similarities of
what we have in common is both of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: pit bulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be a pit bull in this industry
to just weather the storm and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rockiness of all the stuff we have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't even describe the hours and hours
of due diligence that we've done and the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that have been put before us.
[SPEAKER_00]: As he mentioned about lottery,
you know, I was able to axe that with our
[SPEAKER_00]: city government, basically by saying a
simple phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the luckiest that win the ticket to
Gavistor or the most qualified?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would you rather have, especially in
Santa Barbara?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, there's a very
intelligent market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of oversight going in
there and what they decided they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want was the luck of the draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to analyze the operators and
pick the ones that best fit their criteria
[SPEAKER_02]: that they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think in cannabis,
in all areas of cannabis retail included,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you have to have persistence as
a philosophy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a thousand roadblocks that
will blow up, some of them totally
[SPEAKER_02]: inequitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not your fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as an example, when we were going
down their path with a pharmacy of opening
[SPEAKER_02]: up the medical one, we completed the
entire medical application process.
[SPEAKER_02]: After we'd finished that, while we were
waiting for them to review it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they decided they were going to rewrite
the ordinance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad they did because they reconciled
it with adult use and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'd spent, you know, we had a
property under contract paying a lease for
[SPEAKER_02]: three years as they changed the rules
while we were going through the process,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it would be really easy to say
screw this, I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, we were,
you know, both of us were able to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: over the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be, if you don't own it,
and it's a landlord or type of lease
[SPEAKER_00]: property, you have to have approval.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to control the property to even
submit your application, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you think about what that
means, I mean, yeah, sign a lease for two
[SPEAKER_02]: years, then submit your application to
find out if you get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and through that process,
they were going to have five in Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbara, they cut it down to three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all along, the rules are just
constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, you know, we're in a good we're
in a good spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as you mentioned,
like this market is so new and so nascent
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's not a it's not a it's a
competitor help each other market out,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a not a competitor fight with each
other kind of market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're all high tides are lifting
all boats right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk about, you know, I think of like
downtown L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: shop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like probably selling a lot of indoor
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're both in kind of like the affluent
yoga mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, what are you noticing in terms of
like what the consumers want and what what
[SPEAKER_01]: brands are you carrying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, brands are interesting because I
have two competitors that are within 200
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all within on the same street.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key here is to have unique brands for
each store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you're not competing on price
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is you end up in a price
bidding war.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy lowers the price, then you lower
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lower it doesn't help us meet the
challenges of finances with the 280 rule
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing us from writing off expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not making money as everyone is so
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 280 rule prevents us from writing off
rent, phone salaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only write off technically that we can
write off is the cost of goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do a million dollars and we're
forced in the state level to be 60 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: profit margin, you're going to pay six
hundred thousand for your inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leaves four hundred thousand to cover
all of your yearly expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a million for the year,
then on top of that, you have all your
[SPEAKER_00]: salaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have two hundred and fifty
thousand in salaries for your bartender
[SPEAKER_00]: and supervisors and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end, you may end up spending 70
percent taxes on the net dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, 280 is something that they're,
you know, that they would change.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely inequitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are forced to pay taxes, but we pay at
a rate that's, you know, two to three
[SPEAKER_02]: times what anybody else pays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, while having the friction
of not having bank accounts and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff that goes along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, persistence has to be a philosophy
in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think one of the things to your
question, one of the things we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly in Santa Barbara,
is we really over index for flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people it's kind of a traditional
cannabis market from that point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell our biggest category.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aureus flower, which is probably not the
case for dispensary down in L.A.,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's it's extracts and vapes and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we see is people
actually really care about where the
[SPEAKER_02]: product comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a local section in the pharmacy
and it's one of the areas that consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: walk in the door saying, what what can I
get that's grown in Santa Barbara?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually really fun to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you know, it's along the band
locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they want to know their farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the farmer's market kind of
mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I think, because the
demographic that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good for all of us,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in Santa Barbara and some
of the other areas, there's a big focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growing and using pesticides,
pesticide free, recycling water,
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of great stuff, natural sun
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the way the industry is going
to go for the kind of the connoisseur of
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry, where the people who really
care about their health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talk to brands, they talk about
like, you know, competitors who have a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of money, who are doing shopping shops and
paying slotting fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, if a retailer can get more
money because you have all these 280
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are you doing in your shops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just differentiate my brands
different from the other two competitors
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some products that I wish I had,
but it's just not worth it for me to end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in being a pricing war.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the brands, are you are you
charging slotting fees or are they doing
[SPEAKER_01]: shopping?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my area, it's a little different
because Ohio was one of the few cities
[SPEAKER_00]: that did not employ a city tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two methodologies about getting
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was having voter approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cities have already gone through that
process or counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are already set to add a certain
tax on a good example is Oxnard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a six percent tax and a cannabis
specific tax in the city of Santa Barbara,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sales tax plus six points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you take something off the
shelf in California, it's about half the
[SPEAKER_02]: price is taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that hurts us.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the industry grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helps the black market a lot, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's our biggest competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel he's my competitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a retailer in Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a helper in getting this industry out
in the open and getting it to where we
[SPEAKER_02]: have breaking down stigmas, educating
consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the challenges that we share
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to I've been in laboratory
requiring laboratory testing all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: back to 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, it's mandatory in the
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the vape controversy going on
right now, it's even more critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That proper testing I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing I've talked to brands
about is like, let's say they sell,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, typical retail is I sell you
something for 10, you sell it for 20 out
[SPEAKER_01]: the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they're seeing kind of like
I sell the retailer something for 10 and I
[SPEAKER_01]: go in that shop and it's selling for 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard for me to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's we're not we're not doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're not doing it, I'd be real
surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody in L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: with a cowboy shop next door not paying
any taxes is able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they may might look like that
because it's basically a third for the
[SPEAKER_02]: brand, a third for the shop and a third
for the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe maybe that's what they're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're certainly not doing more than
Keystone or, you know, 100 percent kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: typical retail markup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then you're taking out 15 percent
for your excise tax and you're paying
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever your county taxes or that city
tax for sale tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, the city tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so what's your what's the biggest,
I guess, frustration, generality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're dealing with brands,
what's kind of a frustration that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think in general, in the
cannabis supply chain, there's there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cannabis is a tough business
because the rules change and there's a ton
[SPEAKER_02]: of external frictions that you're not used
to having.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, one of the frustrations is
that nobody has really got it nailed yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we probably work with eight to two or
15 distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some some good ones and there's a
whole bunch of not very good ones.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and by the not very good, I mean,
you know, you ordered 20 of something on a
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's supposed to be there on Tuesday
and it shows up on Friday and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: eight of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's the wrong 20 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the number of times the
distributor shows up at the right time of
[SPEAKER_02]: the right day with the right manifest and
inventory list is, you know, 10 percent of
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's hard to run a shop based on that
kind of inconsistent supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's that's a challenge every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing changes with the BCC and
the regulation about testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went from testing only 12
pesticides to 22 pesticides, the list of
[SPEAKER_00]: the national, there were quite a few
distributors that lost millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: in inventory that had to be destroyed
because as a retailer, I'm not allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch the raw products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have to be prepackaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to be childproof and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were warehouses of hundreds of
thousands and millions of dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory that was gathered up by the BCC
and destroyed a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really hurt a lot of distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that seem to be standing out are
the ones who have a network already like
[SPEAKER_00]: their alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were already in some sort of
distribution framework before they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: logistics already set in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my distributors comes from
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their warehouse is one hundred thousand
square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four different distributors taking
twenty five thousand and there are one
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and sixty five vehicles that leave
every morning at three thirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of them to Southern California market
and the other half to Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that logistics is a nightmare alone for
a distributor and putting us in an
[SPEAKER_00]: outlining area is even a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wait until we get to the number of
dispensaries that we should have versus,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the six thousand we should have
instead of the six hundred we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think distribution, it doesn't,
it's not a linear increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not ten times as hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably to the, you know,
order the tenth magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the logistics of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one distributor we work with the most
is Herbal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The president of Herbal comes out,
he was a former president of UNFI,
[SPEAKER_02]: which did, you know, all of the Whole
Foods shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're dealing with a lot of similar
challenges of product that needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh, product with high QC standards,
twenty three hundred stores or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that that Whole Foods has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be those, I think,
those types of companies with a high
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis IQ and a high business IQ that
succeed long term and distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you talk about illegal shops as
kind of your main competitors and weed
[SPEAKER_01]: maps is out there trying to take
advertising dollars from retailers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they're also taking advertising
dollars from your not your illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get four and a half million dollars a
month just to give you the idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: their gross income is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're based in Irvine and they were
given a letter a year and a half ago by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state attorney general to cease and
desist because they were aiding and
[SPEAKER_00]: embedding a class one felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just recently, they said they're no longer
going to do average, but they did not tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you when they didn't put a date.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still going to collect that revenue
for the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in fairness, if someone said,
when do you want to stop getting four
[SPEAKER_02]: million dollars a month?
[SPEAKER_02]: I might take my time coming up with that
date, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to come up with is
another bureaucracy or another system that
[SPEAKER_00]: replaces that money from the legal shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we may see an increase
in our weed maps and some some illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: shops are paying four or five thousand
dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we create a future where like it
doesn't turn into every other industry
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's like MedMen owns all retail and
Candescent and whoever else like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Coca-Cola and Pepsi of retail
distribution and then you have like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Walmart and Amazon like, how do we keep
kind of a thriving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know my course and the course is
basically I'm not after the whole national
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really to be specialized,
to serve the clients and the customers
[SPEAKER_00]: that you serve in that area, because
without them, you don't survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know the approach that we've
taken on the retail level is to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: boutique, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, our approach is that 97% of people
have never been in a dispensary before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're walking in for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you really want is the,
you know, the best five to 10 products in
[SPEAKER_02]: every category.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to be the Walmart of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a negative, because if
you're totally lost and something's
[SPEAKER_02]: completely new to you, having eight
thousand choices isn't helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you want is if someone walked up and
said, hey, what's you know, what's your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite edible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the five things I would recommend
to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's your favorite flower, here's the
10 flowers that I would say you choose
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a lot more helpful for
the next at least five to 10 years than
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you know, mega store of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the market will ask for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one place where the local
licensing may actually have a benefit is
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to force at least some level of
local operators, because those are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the folks in a lot of cases that get
these licenses and permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's going to, I think,
give us a little bit more hometown,
[SPEAKER_02]: small town feel than we might have for
coffee or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one reason why we're going for
a micro license, a type 12, is to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more control over our
manufacturing for our own brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, and kind of control our quality
and just choose the very best cultivators
[SPEAKER_00]: that are out there and the best
manufacturers and the ones who actually
[SPEAKER_00]: stand behind their products and have the
science and the reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vape controversy has not really
impacted us much because that's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20 percent of my market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past month, have you noticed vape
sales going down?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little, but not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think, you know, if anything,
the vape highlights why a regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: framework is better than a prohibition
framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in a prohibition framework,
you pretend like it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a regulatory framework, you acknowledge
that it's there and then you try and
[SPEAKER_02]: control it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all these vape stories are coming
out of unregulated shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vitamin E acetate is one of the culprits
they've identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no product that has vitamin E
acetate in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, through the test, they've actually
started doing some testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things they've found is like
the Jules and the e-liquids and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: nicotine stuff, wildly dirtier than any
cannabis product.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the average e-liquid has four
times the pesticide limits in them than
[SPEAKER_02]: would be allowed in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is kind of a mind boggling thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it at every.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're inhaling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a far higher level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're for sale in every single gas
station.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the one hand, you have cannabis,
which has arguably a cleaner supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: than our food and is sold on the argument
there was because it's combustible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking strawberries to vapes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is vapes to vapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden you see these same
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, none of these products would pass
cannabis testing, yet they're distributed
[SPEAKER_02]: to hundreds of thousands of stores versus
the 600 that we have and everyone worries
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's kind of amazing how what
is allowed in that traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a simple statement of saying
cannabis products are safer than your
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's safer than your produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not even.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've heard about people dying of E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli from lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally couldn't happen in cannabis
because we test every 50 pound batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: In advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not after people die and then try to find
the trucker and the farm that caused the
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I do think the vape industry
will actually increase with regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sales will probably go up because I
think people will, especially with more of
[SPEAKER_02]: the health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just you're not just paying your
taxes, but you may actually be hurting
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when they get movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
