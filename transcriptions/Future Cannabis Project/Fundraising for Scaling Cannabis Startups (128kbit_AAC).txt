[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go into discussion about
some issues on formation, go into the
[SPEAKER_05]: liberty company culture, and then the
fundraise process.
[SPEAKER_05]: For who in Amanda, when you guys first
started forming your companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: when did you think it was necessary to
first engage a lawyer in the kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: lawyers that you thought were necessary
along the way?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know for companies, for example,
that touch the plant, they might be
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking, oh, I need to get my license
first.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go get a regulatory attorney.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that regulatory might end up
saying, I can do everything for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they might have the corporate
expertise.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we sometimes get clients that come over
to us with that issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I thought it might be interesting
to see what your perspective is on when
[SPEAKER_05]: lawyers became relevant.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to tell you what I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to tell you, it may not be what
you want to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I met my lawyer over oysters at a
friend's birthday party.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a lawyer and wanted to get into the
space and wanted to help.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he actually formed a lot of our
documentation in the early days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we got into Y Combinator.
[SPEAKER_08]: Y Combinator has a whole legal department.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully, he didn't mess anything up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they validated it, and it worked out
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a kind of hack that I had as well in
the industry was leveraging the legal of
[SPEAKER_08]: my counterparts or my partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which has helped bridge some gaps here and
there, where you can see a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: different documentation and compare notes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can bring it to a lawyer and
kind of understand how to formulate your
[SPEAKER_08]: own.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are some ways I've been able to
navigate legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think if you're raising financing,
it's really important to get your
[SPEAKER_08]: structure right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, you may be at the finish line
and can't cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, I'm a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I probably started earlier as soon as
money was being spent that was something
[SPEAKER_02]: other than just our time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think once the check was written over
like two grand, we should probably sort
[SPEAKER_02]: this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't pick the right lawyer the
first try.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made plenty of decisions that were
bad decisions that you would think as a
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lawyers aren't entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned that through and through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we go through these questions
tonight, I am going to share a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: screw ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in the very beginning,
when I wanted to start this business,
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to an event called Denver Startup
Week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the largest free entrepreneurial
event in the world, over 10,000 people a
[SPEAKER_02]: year plus show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best panel I went to was called
Founder Fuck Ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these now successful founders got on
stage and told everything they screwed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took notes on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things not to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, I can also tell you some
lessons on things not to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that said, we're doing really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's OK to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to not repeat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can have people tell you about
mistakes that they made and you can avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: those ones, that's one less mistake to
make.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I would say is to piggyback on
what Amanda said is, and maybe atrium is
[SPEAKER_07]: different, but don't let lawyers run your
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We started Arcview in 2010.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I did everything lawyers told me to
do for the last nine years, we wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got to look at the risk factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to look at what you're doing
and understand what's at risk when you
[SPEAKER_07]: take different actions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But particularly because so many things
can cost so much, now if you're able to,
[SPEAKER_07]: and maybe this is what atrium is working
on, is if you can lower the cost to be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to do a lot of those things,
you can protect yourself even more for a
[SPEAKER_07]: lower cost, which gives you the ability to
protect yourself more.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope for the clients that are in the
crowd that we're doing a pretty good job
[SPEAKER_05]: so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the next thing I want to
discuss is a little bit more technical.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also an important point with respect
to when you go to form your company,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's obviously a little bit different if
you're in the business of touching the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant versus just a tech company operating
in the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to hear your thoughts on,
from an investor's perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're investing in a company that
touches the plant, the entity structure
[SPEAKER_05]: that you like to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, a holding company that holds
a holding on subsidiary that holds the
[SPEAKER_05]: license and operating entity that's in
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And your opinions on what you think works
best under the current regulatory scheme.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can speak to it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it really depends on the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, there are elements too that a
lot of investors can get thrown off by a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you'll see a company come that has
multiple LLCs in order to accomplish
[SPEAKER_07]: certain things with 280E rules that
they're looking to avoid, looking to be
[SPEAKER_07]: tax efficient with LLCs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll see investors be like,
whoa, that just looks weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're used to seeing a Delaware C Corp
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll see different companies trying
different things and being innovative.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very tough as an investor to know
what's OK, what's not OK, how that all
[SPEAKER_07]: works.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's where law firms come in
really handy on both sides to really
[SPEAKER_07]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: At Arcview specifically, even though we
bring investors and entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_07]: together, we're not the ones in the deals
that touch the plant, at least so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't placed any capital there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've stayed in the ancillary side when
it comes to us placing capital.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we certainly see a wide range of
setups.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would not call myself an expert on
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm on this panel with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I would say when it comes to
formation and entity type is that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't need to necessarily plan to be one
entity type your entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are planning to go and raise on day
one, certainly, there are things that make
[SPEAKER_02]: more sense than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a cousin that's a top VC down
in the valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does not touch family deals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But his advice to me was, I take money
from early stage startups for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as your cousin, I'm going to tell you
to bootstrap as far as you can humanly
[SPEAKER_02]: bootstrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in doing so, a different entity type
made sense for me in the early days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were an LLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to take advantage of
partnership taxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're taking on losses and
bootstrapping, it's a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really have to not get set on
one type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we went to take on serious capital,
yes, we converted into a Delaware C Corp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have no regrets about forming the
way we did because it made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you make a corporation election,
you can't go back from that so easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to look at what your situation is
and where you're going and not be dead set
[SPEAKER_02]: on day one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing I had for those in the crowd
that are unaware, I know Troy touched on
[SPEAKER_05]: this idea of 280E.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're unaware as to what that is,
it's basically something in the tax code
[SPEAKER_05]: that says that if you traffic an illegal
drugs, you don't get the benefit of
[SPEAKER_05]: certain tax deductions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you're in the cannabis business,
you have to work around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for a lot of businesses in the
cannabis industry, it means you don't get
[SPEAKER_05]: the benefit of your general administrative
deductions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you come up with these more complex
corporate structures to be able to work
[SPEAKER_05]: around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one other thing I wanted to piggyback
of what Amanda is saying, and yes,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the traditional tech sense,
and you guys feel free to correct me if
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wrong, if you see the Delaware company
and it's great for taking VC investments,
[SPEAKER_05]: but for touch the plant businesses,
it's not always the best because,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, cannabis is illegal in
Delaware.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a result, if you get pulled into
court there, that creates a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to think about, you can't just
go on CoolieGo and use their Delaware and
[SPEAKER_05]: corporation docs if you're going to be
applying for a license in California
[SPEAKER_05]: because that changes the place you're
going to be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the moral of that story is simply,
this is where you call your attorney and
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you have an attorney that's
versed in these things and discuss what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're a tech company and many of
you guys are plant touching companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have different needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where trying to, I wish I could
give you guys the answers to everything
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight, but these are why you have to
talk to your attorneys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can speak to two corporate
structures.
[SPEAKER_08]: Meadow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, our union, we're Delaware C Corp.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a technology company.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have four founders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's an equal shareholder.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an option pool that is dedicated
to hiring talent as well as providing
[SPEAKER_08]: advisory shares.
[SPEAKER_08]: How I paid for my initial lawyer,
Oyster Guy, Doug, who's awesome,
[SPEAKER_08]: was initially advisory shares.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that can come into play with having at
C Corp.
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife has an edible company.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a C Corp in California for exactly
the same reason that you said we didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: want a licensed entity in Delaware in case
of any issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a solo founder, but has an option
pool and is taking capital through a safe
[SPEAKER_08]: vehicle.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of what we use as a convertible
without an expiration date, without terms
[SPEAKER_08]: and payback periods.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what YC Corp.
[SPEAKER_08]: continually uses, which I recommend,
but it might not be the best for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an easy way of getting capital
without having to convert that equity
[SPEAKER_08]: initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know those are really good
insights, Hua.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for all of you who haven't heard of
his wife's company, it's called Mellows,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you should 100% try them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think another big step along the
formation highway is dealing with banking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's gotten a lot easier,
but I know Amanda had some really great
[SPEAKER_05]: stories about it, and it'd be great to
hear from you as well, Hua, on any
[SPEAKER_05]: roadblocks you've hit in that space or
just how you got banking services from the
[SPEAKER_05]: get-go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so well, as a former bank regulator,
I can't really lie to bankers about what I
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the absolute perfect target for a
know-your-customer investigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean you didn't know you had
to tell your banker?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a former bank regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't really lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on day one, you know, there was
challenges with that, but I basically had
[SPEAKER_02]: to use my entire network of banking
attorneys and whatnot to find a bank that
[SPEAKER_02]: would take us, and we're ancillary,
but we found one, thankfully, and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been with them for many years,
but they're, like most banks that want to
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with people like us, not a ginormous
bank, and as such, they don't have their
[SPEAKER_02]: own merchant services.
[SPEAKER_02]: So merchant services have been really
challenging for us over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denials and then having merchant services,
no problem for two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you're bootstrapping a company
and you pay payroll off of revenue,
[SPEAKER_02]: and come February 1st, Intuit calls you
and they're like, hey, based on who you
[SPEAKER_02]: take money from, we're cutting you off and
we're not decrypting any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and not to mention, you're a lawyer,
so of course you're not keeping this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: on your personal servers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making sure it gets entered
directly into the encrypted system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say I had 97 accounts
outstanding at that point of customers who
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have payment information for and
I had to make payroll.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not for the faint of heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hard stuff, and that could have
ended my company, could have ended any
[SPEAKER_02]: company that was bootstrapped on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got scrappy and I took on some
consulting projects, and I also had a team
[SPEAKER_02]: that knew what we were getting into all
along, so I was very transparent with
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but I made $30,000 of consulting
money show up in about seven days and I
[SPEAKER_02]: paid payroll, and I called everybody I
knew and got a million rejections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's like, oh yeah, you're an
slayer, we'll be able to get you a bank
[SPEAKER_02]: account, and it was all around the Jeff
Sessions scares at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually I got it done, and I never
thought I would jump up and down for a
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.9% rate, and then eventually we found
one at 5.9 and now we're back into the
[SPEAKER_02]: twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to say the least, save as much money
as you humanly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the in case fund, it's the when
fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's not for the faint of heart,
but we survived that one too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting a bank account is difficult if
you're a licensed entity.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we've also seen is other
structures where there's a holding
[SPEAKER_08]: company, so that's kind of my advice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more about creating a holding company
that manages the payroll or expenses for
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_08]: That allows you a little bit more distance
from it, and that's where you kind of run
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of your payroll and expenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go the route of just saying what
you do, you're going to get denied just
[SPEAKER_08]: saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest advice I would have on this is
to have multiple bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got caught once not having another bank
account lined up, and I'll never have that
[SPEAKER_07]: happen again.
[SPEAKER_07]: We almost weren't able to make payroll,
and it was one of those things where
[SPEAKER_07]: they're like, we're going to send you the
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kicking us out, and they're going
to send us the money.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we take it out by this day,
we can actually have it to be able to open
[SPEAKER_07]: up the other account.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, you'd have to wait 15 days or
something for this check to come to then
[SPEAKER_07]: go, but I had a lot of bills.
[SPEAKER_07]: During that time, I was like, oh no,
I can't not pay people.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we got right under the wire,
and now you look back, you laugh at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we got through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were the good old days, whatever,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have multiple bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even when the bank says, oh yeah,
no, it's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're allowed to work with cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every bank we've ever been in has told us,
well, except for one, has told us that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're totally cool with cannabis,
especially because we're ancillary.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the way these banks work is they've
got their regulatory department,
[SPEAKER_07]: and a lot of times, it doesn't go all the
way up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or somebody from the regulatory department
does give okay, but then a banking
[SPEAKER_07]: regulator comes in and starts giving them
a hard time, and then they have to go back
[SPEAKER_07]: on their word.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this happens like a domino.
[SPEAKER_07]: So have multiple accounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when one falls, you got another one,
and then when that one falls, you get a
[SPEAKER_07]: new one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's getting easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can get a bank account now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it takes work, and sometimes it's not
always the best banks, and sometimes they
[SPEAKER_07]: want to charge you a lot of money to bank
with them, which usually goes the other
[SPEAKER_07]: way around in banking, but not anymore,
not with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's these different pieces of it,
but it's a lot better than it was a few
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago, and I have a good sense that
banking will get resolved very,
[SPEAKER_07]: very shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing to add, and I am hopeful,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we went down to that 6.9 and that 5.9
and down to twos, we still run certain
[SPEAKER_02]: transactions and swall the extra fees and
run things in that 6.9 and that 5.9 every
[SPEAKER_02]: month, because we still need those guys to
be there in case we lose one of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we changed our name corporate-wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to have Canon in our name,
and neither do you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need Green, Verde, Veritas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any iteration of Bloom, Farms,
Flowers, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have multiple reasons why we changed
our name to REGS Technology, but our
[SPEAKER_02]: company and our product are very much
Canon REGS, and we're very transparent
[SPEAKER_02]: with our bank, and our bank, thankfully,
has always been on our side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they opened us the REGS Technology
account the day the problem happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their VPs were trying to get us merchant
services as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep those things out of your
name, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make yourself and your life better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your life less painful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was tremendously helpful for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's move on to structuring the
founding team.
[SPEAKER_05]: What recommendations would you have in
terms of, from the investor's perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: as to what you like to see in terms of
equity split and leaving room for future
[SPEAKER_05]: VC money to maybe come in, to making sure
your founding team is properly
[SPEAKER_05]: incentivized, maybe on similar terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody feels slighted, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Troy, do you want to start
first?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, it really depends on at what
stage you're investing into a company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, every company is totally
different in terms of the incentives and
[SPEAKER_07]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say, I mean, this kind of gets a
little bit into value.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't talk about, yeah, can we talk
about valuation?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's really, or should we want
to wait on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into that a little bit
later, but I mean, let's just assume seed
[SPEAKER_05]: stage companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really early, maybe just starting to go
through the licensing process,
[SPEAKER_05]: the beginning founding team, just kind of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, in terms of what I would
look for in a founding team or like
[SPEAKER_07]: structure stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe just the proper vesting at
a minimum that you like to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, one of the mistakes a lot of people
make is they get a group of four people
[SPEAKER_07]: and they split up all the equity and then
they go out to the, and then like what
[SPEAKER_07]: four people stays together for,
I mean, like it's really rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: Periods.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: And very few people actually think to do,
to actually have everybody vest or to
[SPEAKER_07]: think about what happens if somebody
doesn't work out or if one person puts in
[SPEAKER_07]: more energy than the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's super important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the key reasons to be talking
to a lawyer early on as well to have that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one thing to be really,
that's probably the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave, I'll leave that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you had some stuff to comment on
this when we were talking before this
[SPEAKER_05]: panel in terms of just setting up founder
equity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So myself and three other co-founders at
Meadow, there's four of us, we split up
[SPEAKER_08]: equity equally.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was important.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all vested at the same time as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We left enough for investors that weren't
unissued and we had an option pool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one thing that we've done is,
you know, when we made the decision to do
[SPEAKER_08]: this, you're really getting into marriage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, I don't know, someone's going to
leave maybe, but you know, we kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: committed that we're going to do this
thing all the way through.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think when you, you kind of commit
to that, you have to be able to think if
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to be with this person,
how they compliment you, how do they make
[SPEAKER_08]: the product better or the team better?
[SPEAKER_08]: We ended up creating a set of values as
well to pull from and kind of like help
[SPEAKER_08]: direct the moral compass of the company.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's quite important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, once you formulate
your founding team, it is like marriage.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do need to check in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't just let them go off and kind of
gallivanting around.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about checking in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do it every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a founders meeting every week at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we miss it, that dates the schedule the
next day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where we talk about what's
happening, what went well, what could be
[SPEAKER_08]: better and bring up any other things that,
you know, could bubble up if left too long
[SPEAKER_08]: unattended.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want another, you want another story
of founder mess ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I started this and I was
co-founding with, you know, an attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: who had been a mentor of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, you know, I looked up to him
and I had trusted him and he had 20 years
[SPEAKER_02]: of practice on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the attorney we use suggested
vesting periods and he convinced me why we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't need them, you know, that was
mistake number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a co-founder that, you know,
he had maybe 5% less than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it started with,
okay, well, I'm the elder attorney who
[SPEAKER_02]: knows how to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do it and then he'd be like,
wait, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually I did everything and he did
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he got a day job that doubled his
day job's salary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was left with an extremely toxic cap
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did everything myself and I had a guy
that owned nearly 40% of the company and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty much unfundable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I eventually was able to raise a
convertible note to buy him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, by far and away of all the
negotiations I've done in the entirety of
[SPEAKER_02]: this company, it was the one with this man
that led to more yelling fights,
[SPEAKER_02]: screaming matches, painfulness and threats
that I've ever, I mean, I basically had to
[SPEAKER_02]: threaten at one point, I'll burn it down
and build it again if you don't take this
[SPEAKER_02]: money and go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it done, spare yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like moral of the story is
make sure everybody- Vesting periods for
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think we got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think to wrap up sort of the whole
formation discussion so we can move into
[SPEAKER_05]: fundraising, which I think everybody here
is probably really interested about,
[SPEAKER_05]: any big sort of regulatory blockers that
you ran into outside of baking,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously, just when you're starting your
company and how you worked around that?
[SPEAKER_08]: When we came out of YC, our product was
really around like an Uber for weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Meadow would really facilitate deliveries
between delivery operators and consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we started moving forward in the
regulatory process, it wasn't clear to us
[SPEAKER_08]: whether delivery would survive.
[SPEAKER_08]: We advocated for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We created trade groups around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We fought at a local level to issue
licensing and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had to make a decision on seeing
what license types would survive and that
[SPEAKER_08]: was an evolution into retail point of
sale.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think as you look at your business
models, the regulations are so important
[SPEAKER_08]: because any model can be written out or
written into the regs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully, we did get a Type 9 license
and delivery exists today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, 67% of the state didn't
have any local laws and it was prohibited.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we have another set of regulations
that is perhaps allowing statewide
[SPEAKER_08]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think overall, if you're not
reading the regs and reading the playbook
[SPEAKER_08]: and understanding how this is going to
come down the pipeline, then you may find
[SPEAKER_08]: yourself in an obsolete business model
come the next session.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way I get around that or help get
up that curve is really surround yourself
[SPEAKER_08]: with great people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, joint trade organizations,
they really help.
[SPEAKER_08]: They advocate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they keep you in the loop.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't help but go to a meeting and
just start talking about regs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't like it, you're in the wrong
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I think that's really important
to think about.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2011, I think it was, we had just
started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and Steve D'Angelo went into business
to start Arcview and he was our first
[SPEAKER_07]: investor and everything was going great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were high on this idea of Obama had
come out and said that he was going to
[SPEAKER_07]: allow states to do their own thing and the
attorney general was in favor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all of a sudden he changed his
mind and had this company that was
[SPEAKER_07]: bringing investors and entrepreneurs
together and doing all of this great
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of a sudden in mid-2011,
nobody wanted to do business at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: People didn't even want to come to our
events anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was still early enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there wasn't enough momentum really to
be like, yeah, whatever, like what
[SPEAKER_07]: happened a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was so small at that time that it
really did cut it off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so believe it or not, we had no money,
but I was so committed to it that I kept
[SPEAKER_07]: at it and had to decide whether I wanted a
social life or a home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I decided a social life and I lived in
my car and in friends' couches for about
[SPEAKER_07]: six or seven months during that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was one regulatory hurdle we ran
into and found our way through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some really good insights.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one actually last topic before we move
into fundraising.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, is that a joint?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been on a panel with a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about community at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not going to be stoned while I'm on
this, and I don't want it to be like a bad
[SPEAKER_07]: after-school special.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a banana breath from a Humboldt farm
called Devi.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Devi's friend's farm, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Devi.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've actually never, I've never been
high while on a panel ever before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should try it, but not right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not with a bunch of lawyers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You kidding me?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a lawyer and I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that kind of like... We'll keep
you safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to better things,
like fundraising.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fundraising.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figured we would start with
pre-Series A companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you've formed your company,
founding teams together, maybe done your
[SPEAKER_05]: first key hires, issued some equity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe you've gone through the
licensing process or you're in the middle
[SPEAKER_05]: of the licensing process.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that order of operations look
like in terms of... I shouldn't say order
[SPEAKER_05]: of operations, but what would be the
preferred financing vehicle that you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: generally see for seed stage companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we get founders that come in the
door and like, oh, I want to do a price
[SPEAKER_05]: round because it's so much cleaner on my
cap table.
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes I'm only raising like 500K
and transaction costs might not be worth
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really hard to value a company in
those early days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very, very hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why we see a lot of convertible
notes and safes.
[SPEAKER_07]: In those areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, if you're pre-license,
and this really depends on the state,
[SPEAKER_07]: a little different in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there's a chance you're not going
to get your license, it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_07]: raise money.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's changed a little bit with what's
happening in Canada with the markets going
[SPEAKER_07]: crazy because now with the way that
they're buying these companies up,
[SPEAKER_07]: there are now investors who are like,
all right, I'll take a swing on the chance
[SPEAKER_07]: of getting a license in ways that they
haven't before because of that arbitrage
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's what I would say on that
topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amanda, I know you've done convertible
notes, who saves convertible notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: From your perspective of your seed stage
company, even if you're raising a few
[SPEAKER_05]: million dollars, does it really make sense
to do a price round at that point?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or from simplicity as a founder,
would you prefer to?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I give a more lawyerly answer?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on who you are and what your
appetite is for certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had done convertible debt, and I
converted that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're pretty close to closing our
Series A, and we did price it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to operate with debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of benefits to operating
with debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And simultaneously, I was swore going into
it that I was going to not take any debt
[SPEAKER_02]: in this round.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I ended up taking a line of credit
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so many pros and cons to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really just depends on you as a company
and what you're trying to accomplish and
[SPEAKER_02]: your appetite for different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a huge fan of the safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it really helps bring down the
cost of compliance, but bring down the
[SPEAKER_08]: cost of getting a lawyer to review
documents.
[SPEAKER_08]: It standardizes everything for everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: No investor is trying to put their stake
in the ground and giving you specific
[SPEAKER_08]: terms and dictating what you need to do or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We raised over $2.5 million on safes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have over 40 different investors.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have a discount, but you could
provide a discount.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, people that get in early,
give them a discount on the round.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can price it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pricing it is evaluation, which Troy is
talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little bit more of a dance.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the early days, it's more art than
science.
[SPEAKER_08]: So make sure your narrative is very
compelling.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need more information about
creating a compelling narrative,
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin Kahn, a founder of Atrium,
has a great blog post on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what sells the dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is what sells the investors in to
get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing, though, to be cognizant of on
safes, you can do a most favored nation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So early people, there is no evaluation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever valuation comes down the pipe,
that's the first one that they get,
[SPEAKER_08]: whichever best terms.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could do that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think you can go pretty long on
safes, but you have to be very cognizant
[SPEAKER_08]: on dilution and what happens when that
safe converts to equity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I mean by that is you have an
existing pool of equity that you sold.
[SPEAKER_08]: In that note, in that safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when your equity converts,
that whole piece shifts into the cap
[SPEAKER_08]: table.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the percentages that you thought you
owned get diluted down because now people
[SPEAKER_08]: are getting the equity that they have paid
for via that safe model.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're not careful, you can
oversell your company on safes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And an equity conversion comes and
everyone looks around and doesn't have as
[SPEAKER_08]: much as they owned before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it can get pretty demoralized.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so quick primer, then, for those who
don't know the difference between a safe
[SPEAKER_05]: and a convertible note.
[SPEAKER_05]: A safe on its face is very similar to a
convertible note.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really the big difference is safes
don't have interest or maturity date.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're a little bit more bare bones
on some more lawyerly jargon terms.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get money quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Money fast, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that they were talking about is
dilution and company valuations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some pitch book data came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if people follow pitch book.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Troy and I were actually talking about
this before the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the average pre-money valuation of
a tech company was around, I believe,
[SPEAKER_05]: $8 million pre-money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then average size of a seed round was
about $2 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then that brings your post-money
roughly to about $10 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the cannabis space, are we seeing
something similar?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you mentioned there's a difference
between it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Founders think it's a premium versus
discount.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's hear more about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we're not seeing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might see that with limited licenses
and stuff in some of the states.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you're in a town that only has a few
licenses or something like that,
[SPEAKER_07]: then you can start to see really high
valuations early on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for everybody else and everything I've
seen coming through, we are not seeing $8
[SPEAKER_07]: million pre-money seed rounds,
even as things have started to go up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is just a much more nascent
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the big question as to
whether or not cannabis gets a premium or
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it gets a discount.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're an entrepreneur, it definitely
has a premium, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the hottest industry in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's growing at 27% compound annual growth
rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at it, 66% public support.
[SPEAKER_07]: This stuff is changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get on the bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to win, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you're an investor,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're an investor, it's often the
other perspective, where people are
[SPEAKER_07]: saying, well, the funding ecosystem isn't
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not seeing the funding ecosystem
fill itself out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's going to be the next round of
funding on this?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are all the risks of the regulatory
risks?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a regulator wakes up one day and
decides they're not going to allow
[SPEAKER_07]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: They can point to thousands of examples
all across the country of examples where
[SPEAKER_07]: entire businesses were wiped out from a
regulatory change, including ancillary
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a lot of pressure from
investors to say, look, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: ways to make money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if I'm coming into the cannabis
sector, do I want to pay a premium or a
[SPEAKER_07]: discount because of the added risks
associated with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think that that story is changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're seeing that change a little
bit in the last few months, literally
[SPEAKER_07]: since two, three months ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're starting to see that
narrative change.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there are more investors
willing to pay a premium, but the bar for
[SPEAKER_07]: how good a company needs to be in order to
get that and what their path needs to be
[SPEAKER_07]: has changed as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you go back six months or even
a year, there are very few people who
[SPEAKER_07]: would say that they thought federal
prohibition was going to end in the next
[SPEAKER_07]: two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very few people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there is almost a consensus starting
to brew that by 2020, we will see very,
[SPEAKER_07]: very meaningful federal reform that will,
in effect, be legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that has changed the trajectory of
most companies in terms of what your path
[SPEAKER_07]: is.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a world where all the big dogs are here
and every major company that has a
[SPEAKER_07]: solution is going to want to be in the
space, are you a build or are you a buy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they just going to build it themselves
or are they going to buy you?
[SPEAKER_07]: And are you going to be far enough along
when that happens in order for you to be
[SPEAKER_07]: in the mix for that buyout or to be able
to compete with them, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_07]: So the whole calculus has really changed
in the last three to four months.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're starting to see some of that
premium in conjunction with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one other question I want to get
to before we wrap up that I think there's
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of first time founders here is just
you're in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vesterpool is obviously seemingly smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, how do you identify investors?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you approach them?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you talk to them?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's that order of operations to
getting that first term sheet or dollar in
[SPEAKER_05]: the door, whether it's friends and family
money or more formal VCs that are active
[SPEAKER_05]: in the space?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants to take this one first?
[SPEAKER_08]: We were fortunate to go through Y
Combinator.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we pitched at demo day and we got
introduced to 600 investors.
[SPEAKER_08]: But before that, my first pitch was at
Arcview.
[SPEAKER_08]: And props to Arcview for setting that up,
which ended up, we didn't end up raising
[SPEAKER_08]: money there.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was Vegas 2014.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I got introduced to my mentors,
Emily from Emily Morgan from Poseidon
[SPEAKER_08]: Asset Management, who eventually invested
later.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it was really about putting
yourself out there and meeting different
[SPEAKER_08]: people, being present.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just like lobby conning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't just go to every conference.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to build your business.
What?
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have a lobby con?
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't buy a ticket to the event.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hang out the lobby.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for everyone else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or outside in the smoke circle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just bring some good.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I see you outside of an Arcview event,
I will come get you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make you pay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone give me a badge.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: But spend your precious dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: We use wristbands now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are ways to hack that, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's one area.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You speak with people.
[SPEAKER_08]: People like Justin over there that just
came.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's looking to invest in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should hit him up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what he's investing in,
but I know he's an investor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other area is looking online.
[SPEAKER_08]: AngelList is a really good area of seeing
who's invested in other companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crunchbase is also pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the time, you're going to get
funds.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you drill down, you can see who's
participated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what other deals they've participated
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can really see the whole history of
what someone's doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have the idea of syndicates.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have the ability of getting
people together, they can form a syndicate
[SPEAKER_08]: investing in you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, crowdfunding.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you could do something on Seed Invest
or WeFunder.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if they're doing cannabis,
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Republic.co, some of these platforms that
allow you to have your friends and family,
[SPEAKER_08]: your neighbors, all put in money,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you need to have the narrative.
[SPEAKER_08]: The narrative is super important,
and you need to have a big dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you're doing VC money.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're doing VC money, you have to
understand that their economics is a hit
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the Grand Slam ballpark.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want big returns.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're pitching angels, if you're
pitching smaller funds, they may not have
[SPEAKER_08]: those high aspirational value targets.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why, as you're researching the
investor, you want to research the sector
[SPEAKER_08]: that they're investing in, the stage that
they're investing in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And their typical check sizes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you have more of these
conversations, you can start layering in
[SPEAKER_08]: your pipeline and do the dance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because raising money is a dance.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you ever watch those birds in
the peacocking thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, one dance is over here, and one
dance is over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's totally like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to project confidence and the
ability of executing on your vision.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you need to also be humble enough to
understand that they could help you move
[SPEAKER_08]: forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: And have enough friends that you pitched
along the way, so that your narrative,
[SPEAKER_08]: and the way you explain it, and the
questions that come up, you're ready to
[SPEAKER_08]: just spit off of everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should know everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't, you're going to get back
to them, and you do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just add, everywhere you go,
it's networking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it the conference, be it on the stage
of Arcview.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know when those people are going
to come back in and around of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I flat out have been told no many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just say, no for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we'll talk in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Big Fun, we just closed, was a flat no
in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're a big yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing to know is that keep them
updated on your progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep them updated when new things come
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because somebody who's a no today,
or a no in May, might be a yes in
[SPEAKER_02]: December.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are going to be a no
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But continue to meet new people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And come back around to the ones that
weren't interested with those who are
[SPEAKER_02]: interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because let's be frank, human are
definitely bandwagon in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once somebody takes interest that
they respect, they might start to take
[SPEAKER_02]: interest too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so be cognizant wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know, it might be on the
chairlift in Aspen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be amazed where you'll meet new
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely one of our investors we met
on your small event in New York when you
[SPEAKER_02]: were doing the local town one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to everyone and anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to finish this up, Troy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think with raising money for
cannabis companies, there's a bit of a
[SPEAKER_07]: signal versus noise issue, which is that
everybody wants to talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody, it seems.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're talking to somebody like
everybody will take a meeting.
[SPEAKER_07]: But being able to figure out who will
actually write a check is another project
[SPEAKER_07]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for people who've raised money for
other businesses, it's like just getting
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody to take a look at your whatever
is hard to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everybody will take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you're with investors that
are specific to cannabis, one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: biggest mistakes I see people do that
somebody who's a dedicated cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: investor, they've made plenty of bets in
the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they're looking at you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the first thing that
entrepreneurs will do will start going
[SPEAKER_07]: through the growth charts of how the
market's going to grow and all this kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, don't waste your time on
they're already in.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're already in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about your solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about your team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about your know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got to arc your perspective
differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that a lot of people put a lot
of attention into their pitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, at Arcview, that's the
whole idea, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pitching.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people put so much attention into their
pitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the pitch is a very small piece of the
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is important.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also about follow up,
follow up, follow up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because life starts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people see lots of things that they
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to figure out how to keep
people interested over the long haul.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means you've got to develop a
relationship.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of entrepreneurs that are just
constantly pitching.
[SPEAKER_07]: They go, oh, you're an investor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, let me tell you about my dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing I always want to remind
people is that this is a peer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a peer-to-peer relationship.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some entrepreneurs go out there,
and it's like a scene out of Oliver.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, can I have some more?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some investors are like the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like walk in.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got their suspenders.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they look down on folks or pepper them
with really big questions or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then are sitting back kind of like,
oh, they have all the cards.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not how it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any deal that happens is going to happen
because there's an even trade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that investor needs you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That investor needs a company that they
can get behind that can help make them
[SPEAKER_07]: money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, in a lot of cases, it's more
than money.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about them feeling like they're
having an impact and a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_07]: things that come with why somebody backs,
particularly a seed or early stage
[SPEAKER_07]: company, often has to do with a lot more
than the tangibles of money, a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: intangibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so realizing that this is a peer
relationship, and how would you speak to a
[SPEAKER_07]: peer that you wanted to build a long-term
relationship with?
[SPEAKER_07]: You would act in a way that was confident
and assertive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you would ask questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would ask questions of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you into?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you do besides investing in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a whole host of other
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you work with an investor,
it's a long-term thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just about getting that
investment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about building and being able to
enlist their support over time as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I would say about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we are out of time in terms of
additional questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But are there any questions from the crowd
that we didn't answer?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take five minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Question was, which bank?
[SPEAKER_07]: Which bank?
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I don't even know at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: My CFO handles it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bank's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called Alpine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't touch plant touching,
so only ancillary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been able to get at least a half
dozen ancillary providers in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't just go in and say,
I hear you do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to find somebody who banks
there to make introductions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relationships are key.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also a Colorado bank,
so it's not quite as relevant here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a Colorado company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're ancillary too, so it's
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: On silent partners and investors,
what's your analysis on taking on people
[SPEAKER_03]: for operating agreements and licensing
agreements?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like white labeling,
but you're having a management firm,
[SPEAKER_03]: a real estate firm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second thing would be,
how exactly does it benefit a company by
[SPEAKER_03]: dividing your different operating arms
into different companies?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you gain advantage through the tax
system, exactly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's looking at me, but I don't
have an answer to any of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I have lawyers for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you asking specific to 280E issues
right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, there's the tax piece,
but then there's also the question about
[SPEAKER_07]: the licensing and creating operating
agreements.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is called the time when you
really want to go call a lawyer and ask
[SPEAKER_05]: them these kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: First one's free, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing, though, to keep it cognizant
about the white label and the licensing,
[SPEAKER_08]: in the regs 50-32, in the proposed regs
that now are now post-commitment,
[SPEAKER_08]: updated OAL regs in the gray zone,
there is regulation that doesn't allow
[SPEAKER_08]: non-licensed entities to work with
licensed entities to do white labeling.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that's kind of the route that you
want to go, it may or may not exist in 30
[SPEAKER_08]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hurt your brain too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Perry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just coincidentally talking to
Jeff Jones in class about the Delaware
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually interested in probably
cooperating, but why didn't you or how did
[SPEAKER_00]: it go with the Delaware account with you
as far as it being an LLCC and how can I
[SPEAKER_00]: protect myself best in that process?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so the software side of the
business, which is my side in our
[SPEAKER_08]: household, is Delaware's C Corp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Traditional, pretty much how you would see
it in most.
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife is a California C Corp.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, one thing that you want to do,
I mean, I guess it's like how you're
[SPEAKER_08]: divvying up your equity, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you're granting it all to
yourself, you should fill out an I-83B
[SPEAKER_08]: that allows you to, if you do sell,
you don't have to pay that much taxes on
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess it really depends on your
business and how your business partners
[SPEAKER_08]: are and how you're structuring it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're trying to go for investment
and you're trying to get founders and
[SPEAKER_08]: you're trying to get equity and an ability
to do advisory shares, I'm the C Corp.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know many other groups that are
doing it, but C Corp.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what I would do.
[SPEAKER_05]: LLCs are a little weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: From a liability perspective, LLC versus C
Corp, is in theory going to provide you
[SPEAKER_05]: the shelter from personal liability,
just on an operating standpoint,
[SPEAKER_05]: like if you got sued for running your
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we're talking on a cannabis level,
it's a little bit different because
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is not legal in Delaware.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't form a Delaware corporation
to apply for your, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation permit in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that instance, you need to be
looking at alternative structures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally, what we have our clients do
is they're either going to see,
[SPEAKER_05]: we do have some where they will have,
they'll form a Delaware company that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: holding company for another company that
is formed in California to apply for the
[SPEAKER_05]: license.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for example, you'll take your
investments through the holding company
[SPEAKER_05]: level, but you actually operate your
cannabis business in this subsidiary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to reach out and we can provide
you a little further resources that you
[SPEAKER_05]: can read up on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question is regarding fundraising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever tap into other communities
that you belong in besides being a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis entrepreneur?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I'm a queer woman of color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm trying to tap into networks
where they're trying to support
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs in that kind of community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you did, what were some of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely, when I first did Arcview,
actually, I honestly hadn't had much
[SPEAKER_02]: experience pitching.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thankfully, my pitch is much better
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did great.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first moved here to San Francisco,
I tried to find all the interesting pitch
[SPEAKER_02]: events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the best ones I went to was
female founders pitching female funders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was super valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, it helps to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have lots of nice things to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, those were funds that were very
conventional VC funds, not cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our tech is going to scale outside of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today, we make all our revenue in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that definitely is limiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was great because I got
relationships out of that with Urban
[SPEAKER_02]: Innovation Fund and Bessemer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both check in on me quite
regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they might not be our investor
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I knew I was going to run up against
an issue with the rest of our financing
[SPEAKER_02]: based on something our leader had put in
there that I couldn't really fight him on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was able to call them and say,
hey, how do you suggest I frame this when
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to do the next part?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both answered me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we'll use them down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, the female events are good,
if nothing more for mentorship and the
[SPEAKER_02]: introductions that come through that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would also say that looking at
college, alma mater, alumni networks,
[SPEAKER_07]: these sorts of things, especially because
cannabis is exciting for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of circles that you
can tap into.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a certain novelty factor about
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: That people will be like, oh, yeah,
let's check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I know through Arcview,
about a year ago now, we started the
[SPEAKER_07]: Women's Investor Network within Arcview,
which has really become a real source of
[SPEAKER_07]: power and mentorship and camaraderie
within the group, where we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: women investors who are specifically
interested in backing women founders.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that's been happening
a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I encourage that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The common wisdom is that when times
become hard, people tend to gravitate a
[SPEAKER_04]: little more towards their vices.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people think that a recession is
on the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curious to hear your opinion on whether
you think that a current entrepreneur in
[SPEAKER_04]: the space looking to raise, say,
a Series A should maybe try to accelerate
[SPEAKER_04]: their fundraising process in anticipation
of an upcoming recession, or if you think
[SPEAKER_04]: that even with the oncoming recession,
there won't particularly be a tightening
[SPEAKER_04]: of the capital markets in this space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Money is very finicky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it when you can is a good motto.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't raise too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: But usually what I find is companies raise
too late and not enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's usually not the other way around.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I would say is that when
the economy goes down, it's not good for
[SPEAKER_07]: us because it means people have less
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a little more protective.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also, in a lot of ways,
we're a little bit recession proof,
[SPEAKER_07]: too, because if other things are going
down, this becomes one of the few places
[SPEAKER_07]: where you see the CAGR, the compound
annual growth rate, still being really
[SPEAKER_07]: strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it has too much to do with
people clinging to their vices.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that particular thing,
I think, is maybe after everything's legal
[SPEAKER_07]: everywhere and you've got something going
on like that, that it would have that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the factor of new states legalizing is
far more of a push from that side of
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be what I'd say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to answer Nancy's question
while I have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Investors are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have different meetings and groups,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of conferences.
[SPEAKER_08]: I chose to go into my startup community.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Launch Festival is something that we've
been a part of, that we've gone to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Runway was another group in the cannabis
space that had something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lesbians Who Tech, that's a whole other
group in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually investors are going to those
spaces and trying to figure out who to
[SPEAKER_08]: invest in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So jump around.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can meet new people everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this space is interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting enough that a lot of
people may consider it.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the recession question,
I think as a founder, this feels very
[SPEAKER_08]: .com-y, but also 2008, 2009, when you had
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that dire.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't see that happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think when you feel recession
coming in, then as a founder, you have
[SPEAKER_08]: three ways to really bulletproof it.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, sure, you can go raise money.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think more importantly, cut your
costs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Figure out where you don't need to be
spending money.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then figure out how to make some
money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes the best cure for a founder is
not to go pitch 20 people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to go sell or pitch 20 potential
partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: That way, it gives you traction.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives you money in the bank.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives you product feedback to see if
you're resonating and if your pitch is
[SPEAKER_08]: resonating.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to be in a situation where
you need to raise because investors can
[SPEAKER_08]: smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know you need it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you do that, you lose a little bit
of leverage in your negotiating.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're like, I don't need you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got my business.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a strong team.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've cut our costs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be profitable later.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the biggest thing that we've
learned is it's not about the first one
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to be one of the last ones
standing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And by making sure you constantly have a
runway, whether it's three months,
[SPEAKER_08]: six months, ideally, 12 to 24,
I think that gives you enough longevity in
[SPEAKER_08]: this thing to ride out the three,
six month interim waves, then you're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you ramp up costs, if you ramp up
hiring, and you know you're not going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be able to hit your growth targets,
then you're going to be in a situation
[SPEAKER_08]: that just is a downward spiral.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was a very good note to end
on.
Thank you.
