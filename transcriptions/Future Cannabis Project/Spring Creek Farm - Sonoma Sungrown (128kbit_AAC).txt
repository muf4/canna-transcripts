[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, so what do you do,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the deal, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it grow, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you with Bobita or what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tox soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you're going to share about the
reality of what it took to grow that this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was a tough fucking year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it started with a
atmospheric river and a 150 year flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where did you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right here in Casadero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Casadero in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_02]: A 150 year flood?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was maybe exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were dealing with some severe
water events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every bit of a 100 year flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the worms literally rise up
out and try to find shelter from the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I personally didn't flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other farms did flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're up on a hill on the
mountainside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're at about 800 feet in
elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: South facing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have northeast and west facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, which perspective is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just really depends on.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do your girls like it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they like growing with the
different light profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I do mix light depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so it's not just only an outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I specifically focus on full spectrum
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really push it to the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of have a hodgepodge of lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have HPSs, T5s, far reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the light depth cover itself,
which you're manipulating the sun then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically have about four different
ways you can just come at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can control the timing of the
photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really manipulate a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It to express itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working with it in a lot of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I've really worked
on doing is like this silver OG,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a 63 day plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to finish it in 53 days,
100 percent for real, no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like in 2017, we took third at the
Emerald Cup in light depth with our silver
[SPEAKER_01]: OG that we grew in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like 10 days short from where.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was in like our 12 year old
soil at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not tilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not ripping it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're loving on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do this no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing no till light depth for
like 16 years, 17 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we haven't bought bottled
nutrients basically in 15 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it great?
[SPEAKER_01]: For pretty much ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now and then a little a bottle
here and there just to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe for some.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, yeah, I haven't bought
anything in ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, when we placed third at the
Emerald Cup, we really were eliminating
[SPEAKER_01]: everything opposed to adding stuff to our
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a process of eliminating,
refining, getting rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it is broke, get rid of it or fix
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really what I focus on is trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about trusting nature, trusting your
relationship with the plants and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: what they tell you and not imposing your
will on them and just do what they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really simple, except it's really
not that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's not simple because
literally everything we thought we knew
[SPEAKER_02]: tells us to do something a little
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to spend time with my kids and I
don't and I have no fear of them eating
[SPEAKER_02]: anything in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no poisons.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use life to grow life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people go out and they buy a
probiotic and they take a pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: That life is on outdoor grown living soil,
no tilled, mature life that it's on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to take a probiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your food is life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I grow potatoes, South African
ground cherries, anything invasive,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically with my cannabis for,
you know, for several reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether it's IPM or just for
food to just because they're part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which ones when you grow for IPM?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just different flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have chrysanthemums and yarrow and
nettles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, pretty much all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marigolds are often recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found this year that the sunflower,
like it was the indicator species if I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to even see an aphid and then it
became the bank species where I never had
[SPEAKER_02]: a problem on any plants, but there were a
few on a sunflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a lot going on this year
because it was kind of a crazy year and we
[SPEAKER_01]: were actually not going to plant at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't really planted at all until the
last minute, you know, because we started
[SPEAKER_01]: the year with a atmospheric river,
which, you know, brought down like a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred year flood, which kind of fucked
everything up, slowed everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a phone, you know,
phones or, you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys were overwatered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, on our road slid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was literally doing tractor work for
from whenever up till whenever you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I should have been working on my
farm, installing my cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: my outdoor site, which so I wasn't doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I'm doing road work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time and then plus the
state, they were, you know, stalling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, you know, you're kind of
broke at this point as a small farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got like five grand and you're like,
should I spend it on plants or should I,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just keep my pocket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I spend on the plants,
which the state hasn't renewed my license
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and if they don't renew my license,
then I'll be out of compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I'll have no money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to cut down my plants,
dig them up, sell them, try to hustle
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or whatever to recoup whatever your
last, which, you know, your last dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to just not plant,
you know, which was like, at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're playing Russian roulette because
you're like, will the state renew my
[SPEAKER_01]: license on that date if I'm planted and
then will they're going to just come and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, slam you if you're out of
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had plants in pots just waiting or
did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do seed and would have a whole
bunch of plants, but I didn't do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: because I didn't know what was going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when it was like Sunday night at
like six o'clock, they call us when Monday
[SPEAKER_01]: morning it's going to expire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call renew it Sunday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was like in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so then it was like,
you know, so then, you know, July 17th,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, or that first week of July.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, everybody's almost everybody's
out of everybody's out of out of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to find like desperately like,
give me anything you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, whatever block to block,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to get some of my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I managed to get some good,
you know, I got some silver OG luckily
[SPEAKER_01]: from my guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, you know, I'm yeah, I can work
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some 24 K, which was beautiful,
was challenging because it literally like
[SPEAKER_01]: quadrupled in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had a plant grow so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it was because of my the regime
that I was doing with this Jadam liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's some great stuff starts to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really I really feel like have you done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the KNF practices and the IMOs,
it's it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the science behind it is on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is not guesswork anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can prove with scientific tests
that the plant grown in your soil is
[SPEAKER_02]: different than the same cultivar grown
down the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the bacteria are, you know,
there's just that's what IMO is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why that's what IMO is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just working with your team
that's already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to give them a hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're they're like, dude,
we like the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to hang out at the bar,
but he doesn't want to get paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just likes to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feed my soil like twice a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even I'm not on like a plant
feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a soil feeding schedule twice a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll feed my my soil like basically like
high fungal wood chips, worm castings,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just keep lots of green matter,
grasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drive around if whatever I get,
see tannoy leaves where everybody else is
[SPEAKER_02]: driving to the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like that wood chip pile has value.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gardener over there, I know that lady
doesn't use any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get that grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some like rotten log rolled off into my
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like full white.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, oh, they're the fun guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yes, I'll take that home with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just pretty much anything you
can and I have a track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go to the beach with my kids and it's
buckets of kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I went to the beach with my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any kids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have two kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a boy and a girl.
Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, isn't it great?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they out in the garden with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not in the cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not allowed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I mean is my kids know about
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes how I interact with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm growing them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so they're they're learning
about patience and character.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my seven year old, he had his big,
he's got like 104 gallon, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's his.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do whatever he wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he chopped and dropped the whole damn
thing in the middle of veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's his learning experience because
he's in the garden with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I want them?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like your garden is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this year, the beautiful thing
about focusing on the plant spirit
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine end of it is that it distracts
you from the pathogen of compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from Josh from Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like for you to wait and repeat
that because that's not from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from like Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh shared that with me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, so we just have to find a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you know, I'm kind of like,
I'm really, I'm really like, if it ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just listen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, this is where there's
all this science and science is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But technically you just don't need to
know the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only really need to know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a problem, if there's no
problems, why would you spend your whole
[SPEAKER_01]: life researching something when you don't
have to?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just do it this way with,
with, you know, which is like a very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, you know, yeah, this,
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way is basically like five things,
you know, as long as you do the five
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you don't have to do the,
the it's, it's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I won't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list of what I won't do is like huge,
but the things that I need to do are five
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is focus on the ground, you know,
focus on the light, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fire or light, air and water, and then the
void or the plant spirit medicine end of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as I focus on those five things
and stay on track, that guides me and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to impose my will because
everything is done for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, so I don't need to know all the
science in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because it's just like, you just have
to listen and do what you're told is
[SPEAKER_01]: really simple, except it's, it's,
it's challenging because you have to build
[SPEAKER_01]: that relationship of trust, which takes
time and you got to put in your time to
[SPEAKER_02]: build that relationship of trust with your
plan, with your plants, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like grabbing smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ropes of sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to, you just have to like,
yeah, I'm listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where dog is like right there,
you know, like we're, we're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: they could wag their tails.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't all the time where the plants
are like, you know, it's just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a whisper in the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, wait, wait, wait,
if you think you heard something you did,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like have you, I know you have,
but most people don't hang out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wait, don't tell me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're working on to remind a
bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, but there's, there's a freedom now
that you can grow a plant outside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just be at peace with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go hang out with your kids.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is allowing for that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your personal space, you can have your
family, your whole family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants are part of it because
they're part of the ecosystem and you are
[SPEAKER_02]: part of that ecosystem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we build soil, when I type,
does your phone ever auto correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a phone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get a phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just get one about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it'll take your life over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just like, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally have the rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go out to the garden, I'll,
I'll record like time-lapse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I can't be on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone's doing something and I'm doing
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a time-lapse of us rolling 150
joints last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, so tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so tell me about your strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about your girls, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can run anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to be able to adapt and,
and feed the, you know, just adapt.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about feeding soil,
we're talking about feeding the biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: the life that's in the soil that eats the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that in a lot of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of ways to skin that cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like you use cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have other life growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just lone soldiers standing out
there by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to lay it on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, a scalable, high production,
no till, micro-remediated, subterranean,
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum, light depth, bio-retention
pit technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, that's what we've been missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you know what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: The layers upon layers of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That took a while to realize, even realize
that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've always been doing that
technique, honestly, since the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what I was told to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that and it, and I, now I just
trusted the process from the beginning and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like now, now the benefit of
having a microscope and learning all the
[SPEAKER_01]: science, it's like when I, when I learned
some science after living it for 15 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh my God, that's what that's
called.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know I was doing no till for
12 years that I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate those labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the first year MJ Biz in Vegas
and I was like, I was like, I'm doing no
[SPEAKER_01]: till.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was like, I think we're doing no
till.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I learned all these labels,
you know, JDOM, now I'm doing JDOM,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I've been doing for 15, 16,
17, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm doing living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the newest one is JDOM that I,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just, it's just, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's about is, is adapting,
growing, you're growing yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the, the, the, the,
the most beneficial thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you get to actually work on
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some real shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of work and dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing light, light depth so
long, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got like 5,000 hours into just
pulling covers alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's equal to pulling a cover every day,
twice a day for the next 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: straight, every day for 10 years straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, that's discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's with the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were some of the things you learned
with experimenting with different parts of
[SPEAKER_03]: the spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just shortening, shortening my
harvest times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take a 63 day strain and finish it
in 53 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I was taking a purple punch and,
and that's like, that was finishing it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's still, I have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 35, 40 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like completely 40 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was like dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people are like,
oh, it's late.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like you must have a,
a decreased yield because you planted
[SPEAKER_02]: blades or, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean the silver OG I've been doing
when I took third at the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do I, not only do I shorten the
harvest time by 10 days, but I don't water
[SPEAKER_01]: for a month because of my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I charge my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I charge my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the last month, I don't water
for 28 days straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, but who does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean the, the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're literally feeding your plant and
it's, it's, it's allowing that plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: control that very fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus they're just like diving and,
and just, but you know how they'll also
[SPEAKER_02]: grow out a lot of the root spread,
but it's, it's the other life that's part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so you can literally like,
I know people that dry farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have water at all.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite in the, in the environment
for that, but you got to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that environment is that the
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what turns dirt into soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to focus on like high fungal,
you know, which anything high fungal I can
[SPEAKER_01]: gather.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, you know, there hasn't been
a lot of, uh, this is all kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: coming about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just kind of winging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're all kind of winging it on
some level, but it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really just, uh, in love with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Connection and that relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, now that I, the science is just
going to be like, if that's what blows my
[SPEAKER_02]: mind is like learning, like really what it
creates a, just a different language.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows you to interact with deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did instead of pulling light depth
tarps, they spent the last 10 years
[SPEAKER_02]: looking through a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that same intensity and passion,
and they figured some tricks out that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've learned too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulling tarps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't do it the same way you did the
first day, do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having that bigger picture,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your soil creates that depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to farms that like cannabis and hemp,
but also strawberries and spinach and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe squash, you know, whatever,
you know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those plants grow in dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like, and you can see, I can show
you like it is that clear cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we miss something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be like that with,
with, uh, it doesn't have to be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you don't even have to like know
all the labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the nice part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to know the name of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to get like hung up on
the labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know what your intent,
what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to encourage fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they eat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ligden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wood pulp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to add it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's a, with the wood pulp,
there's a lot of meat on the bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good description.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where grass breaks down super quick,
the wood chips will just hang out for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, yeah, you know, cause it's just
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to apply, you know,
it's just a job, you know, so try to
[SPEAKER_01]: simplify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day you're working.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hardly, I hardly even touch the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, but you hardly even touch the
plants these days because you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork, compliance, compliance work.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you can go out to the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not work anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You exhale, maybe you inhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's time that you spend out
there that even my wife knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not focused on the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not focused just on money,
then you can enter that zone where that's
[SPEAKER_02]: where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the nice part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not work as in I need to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's work as in I'm going to go grow for
me, my plants, my community, my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my ancestors, out of respect for our
ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For seven generations, for the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generations back and forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three are like the Trinity as far as
in my mind, when I, when I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I fighting this, this beast or to
do this simple act of growing a plant for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the, because this is why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're losing a little bit of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm doing it also to help
people to remind, you know, so that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: be reminded by pushing, it's reminding me
so I can help other people remember so we
[SPEAKER_01]: can all remember why we're doing this for
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real reason on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not what we had to do to get by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not what we endured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not what we put up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not what we get to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do get hung up on that because it's so
like, ah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is, where we're going,
that stays out of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, where we're going and it's not
where we've been.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, okay, we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the cool part.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, we can say, like I asked farmers who
are so overwhelmed by today, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: really, they're overwhelmed by yesterday
and last week and everything else,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paperwork and ridiculousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, the wife, like, yeah, it's like,
it goes down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you felt like, when you're out in the
garden, like time is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just cannabis because I'm,
I do that all the time, but you have this,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it's a different rhythm and it
doesn't settle right with this sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rush and the pace or the,
the phone call that says, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to pick up your kids from school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, I'm literally in fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smell like, like, fish death,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful for the, I smell like,
like the sulfur or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a phone call from the school.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, your son just puked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're covered in like, but that's what we
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how old are your little ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Six and nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nine year old.
[SPEAKER_02]: How, how does they take to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, she's a little savage.
Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm teaching her martial arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's learning to be an herbalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's learning to like, work on,
you know, trucks, run a tractor,
[SPEAKER_01]: butcher a deer, you know, real skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real life skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't fake calluses.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to like, you know, work a shovel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them shields.
[SPEAKER_02]: They help protect you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the boys will be like, I got a new
shield today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My callus last year developed into like a
claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have like climbed a building with
that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a ninja claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, just, yeah, it was nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Past two years working like 18,
20 hours a day for two years to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: this point, you know, just about killing
yourself vacation, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like a, a part of a scuba rig
that I have seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: A scuba rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of a scuba rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the regulator on a scuba tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps me breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, I call it the industrial
steamroller.
[SPEAKER_01]: The safety is on right now because it's
not really in steamroller mode
[SPEAKER_01]: technically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's the safety is on
because, uh, it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hits hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't necessarily pass it
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have an inner chamber and,
and tubes that, is there water?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just direct drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a manual transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it sounds like a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: High throttle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really started as a joke, but like all
good things that start as a joke,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're actually a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just kind of kept rolling with
it because, uh, you know, it, it worked,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I had a buddy who says,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the shit and turn it into
something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I make compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, sometimes you can do
it for real and it feels really good to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like metal work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a welder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do shipping container buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I build, I build like expedition
vehicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use, I have a 40 foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a 40 foot shipping container,
a sea train, but I use, it was like three
[SPEAKER_02]: grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper than one of those sheds at
Home Depot, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grow, I have worm bins in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like, it's, it's alive and it
allows me to have a habitat that's out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the elements and I can control a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just lit cruising all year long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built this 3000 square foot shipping
container building out of scrap and
[SPEAKER_01]: surplus steel by the pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I built the building essentially by the
pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I built all the decking out of
old growth, redwood, two by six that I
[SPEAKER_01]: milled from my property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are even your trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are trees from our they needed,
you know, they were not the healthiest
[SPEAKER_01]: trees because they're old growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been through a lot of fires and
bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was more of a culling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more of a culling of the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I'm fucking cutting down old
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm culling, I'm culling the
forest for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the health of the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trees that are not scarred to shit
and full of bugs and are rotten and burnt
[SPEAKER_01]: out and you're going to fall over on your
house, whatever, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's better to take those down,
mill those, clear the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the trees that are there will
grow like 30 to 60% more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your children will most will be more
likely to have some millable wood in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future and protect the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You changed the photo period of that
space, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've changed the life and it explodes in
stuff that you haven't seen in years
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's just been waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it takes a long time for those
giants to fall on their own and it waits
[SPEAKER_02]: for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what is that in my pocket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you really have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I have this new thing for my
excavator, this flail mower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I can reach like 25 feet in the air
and just like mulch a tree to the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes it three dimensional.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally takes away this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't have to touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take like down to a five inch tree
just right to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in one motion, like literally
just work it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can suck all the branches in and just
shoot the leaves down and just mulch the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll have like mulch like this deep,
knee deep, knee deep mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forest is like so happy about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could not be happier because that's
what the forest wants to eat is its own
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I've been focusing on just
feeding my plants cannabis leaves because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the males out of the garden,
they have purpose.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cannabis leaves fed to your plants
in an anaerobic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it speeds up the process of breaking
down the organic matter and makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: inorganic nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're literally growing with life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, instead of it taking a year,
you can you you quick, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you speed it up to like three days,
two weeks, a month and three months or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did soil testing and it was a total
total basket case of the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing there except what they call silty
clay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like concrete or moon dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is no in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went from a two inch to a three foot
soil depth just by adding life and feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's amazing if you grow grasses
like Sudan grass, cut it down and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: laying it down and then spray it with like
an IMO for that life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go travel down 50 feet or whatever
into the ground and just bring it to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's straight up magic as far as that's
impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I need cobalt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go get a bag or I can go to this or
you can just feed the life and it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you introduced yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a wild, awesome ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has.
[SPEAKER_01]: An amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just these past couple of years,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: These past like three years have just been
like mind blowing for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never, we, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And where is it going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not in a million years, three years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you have thought that right now
you'd be sitting here and this is what be
[SPEAKER_02]: going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were about to sell our
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were selling our property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we won the Emerald Cup and we
were like, fuck, now I'm supposed to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were about to, you know, we were going
to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like, I'm going to give up
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took that as a sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I.
[SPEAKER_00]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took third in light depth with our,
you know, 13, whatever decade old soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with just water, you know,
with one compost tea, water and like one
[SPEAKER_01]: super light top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, I was just really
like trusting the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, that's what was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what one is the process,
the methodology, the soil, the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, you know, by trusting them,
that's what they produce is the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, you know, so for the least amount
of money, you know, the most consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I've been able to, and I've been
able to hit my, you know, 50 pounds per
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I grew like 250 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in 2017, it's called return on
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, when we wanted to see if we had
what it took to stay in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we doubled our production, cut our
costs in the half, in half, and then one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, took third in, in light depth in
the, at the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were like, okay, I guess let's keep
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were testing out at like 30,
29 to 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistently 28 to 30% with our OG,
silver OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's THC or full, full, full,
uh, total cannabinoids like about 29 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been holding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and then we took a third at the weed
con this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we were in the harvest box for organic
and farm again, spring Creek farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're Sonoma County's oldest living soil
brand in light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, technically I think, you know,
cause we've been, uh, this, this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: funny one that it kind of gauges your
grow, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you, when you go out there at night,
do you see worms hunting around on the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they come out to play while you go
home and go to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still out working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love spending time in the dark in my
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really like addicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad that's my new addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green light, the green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a, you know, a headlamp with the
green light and I'll just hang in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and just, I, the vibes are just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard of method seven?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would connect you with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make these lenses that they literally
were designed scientifically because a man
[SPEAKER_02]: was tired of seeing his friends go wrong
lines and he knew about filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a photographer, like visually going
blind, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going back to these grows year
after year and he's like, what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: with George?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, people are getting blind from the
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it changes how you see things,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they've developed it enough
that you can put these glasses on and it
[SPEAKER_02]: can be purple or HBS orange, you know what
I, and it's like walking out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more people need to remember that
that's where plants grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it'll change the industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That if you remember that plants grow out
in the garden, it's just that mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I'm not sure how to use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's some Keith.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Keith.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like hand pressed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't forge the metal,
but you know, I mean, yeah, I put the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces together and I assembled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's quite functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bottle opener has many uses
conversation grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of have multi-tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude, it's, it's a hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it as a hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be, you know, use as many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's straight up, like a bottle opener,
like right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That edge pop, like give me that boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've used as a hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's like a handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put like shopping bags from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you bring stuff in the house when
you're carrying something in your arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus it's, um, I've got a solar attachment
for it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little like solar oven one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a magnifying glass, but it's
enough and it mounts to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, yeah, it bolts onto here,
but I just, I fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's not working right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put like a chunk of hash on there
and you can just like hit it with the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, where's that light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, give me a lighter here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, uh, let me get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put, let me refresh it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's in steam roller road,
steam roller mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it'll, it hits hard,
really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took it to steam roller mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I won't go steam roller mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to hear about the safety though,
and how you choke the carb on it or
[SPEAKER_02]: however it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, if I remove the end,
you know, and you just use it as a steam
[SPEAKER_01]: roller, you know, like, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I just usually roll with it like
direct drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just safer, you know, in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's safer in public like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to, I don't want to fuck
somebody up too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be like fucking kill somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm looking at trying to find a,
I need more volume and I don't do
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: More volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking like vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I do just flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't like dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, wait, let me, let me put a,
let me put a chunk on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it gets going.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to feed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you've been on this property for
18 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've said, no, I've been there for like,
uh, in, in Zadaro for, yeah, like seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: 17 years, 16, 17 years or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on this property for like 10,
12, 13.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What year is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I do, I do want to come back to 14
years, I guess the return on investment
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were saying that because of how you
cared for your lands, you spent $150.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you, the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 pounds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I was buying stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year I didn't spend anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except from brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't buy brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even buy the brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm JDOM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing like a KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF is like, that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like KNF is like sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: JDOM is more protein based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF is more sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: JDOM gets it out of breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacterial versus more complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A protein is more protein based breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's stinkier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas KNF is like sweeter smelling,
which, you know, can draw bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the spring I'll charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I'm just, I don't, I'm not going to
buy sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In springtime I'll charge the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I have to go buy, where's the
sugar?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, is it on my property?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I see bags of sugar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get me some sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some brown sugar?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already like kind of, that's just
my, my minimalist, extremist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of who I am anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the JDOM methodology really,
I was already, you know, I'm very Fukuoka
[SPEAKER_01]: about how I operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very Fukuoka like, you know, it's like,
that's why I say I do like a no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it called stunned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like no-till trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's like, there's like,
you can do no-till, but then you're like
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing anything, then you're like
doing it, but you don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to not do it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between not doing it and like not,
not doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, it's just doing it.
Does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally get what he's talking about
because you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fine line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not dicking around with your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're focused, you're being so efficient
and effective that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might look like I'm not doing
anything, but that's not what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally doing some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some shit's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to take three months for
you to really see it hit that direct
[SPEAKER_02]: drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because the plants now we're not
operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like the turtle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the rabbit and the, and,
and, and the turtle and then the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then plant speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different rhythm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like the, the rabbit, the turtle,
the tortoise, and then a plant speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, but the plant just like beats the
rabbit because it just connects into the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelial network and pops up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant can do it all while not even
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nothing even changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't even, nothing even happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wake up one day and you're like,
wow, plants are just magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's growing really well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take sunshine and make sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here like this, like, you know,
as science, as science can go,
[SPEAKER_02]: they really don't understand how that
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like this one round I did,
I just was giving it water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't, didn't feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't even give it a top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looked perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife was like, you know, do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, do you, how's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, oh, you do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to the plants and I was like,
she wants me to, I should do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, and the plants were
like, well, if you really feel the need
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to, you know, if you want to do
something, if you want to met,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you really want to do
something, you know, go ahead,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't need you to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to mess something up to
make yourself feel useful as a human,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to mess, like everything was
so perfect, why mess it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the garden and I'm like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, all right, I won't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm like, I'm just not going to,
she's like, so what'd you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to talk with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told me like, I'm just going to fuck
them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my wife was really saying,
spend some time in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, isn't that ideal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get some time for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's just functioning and rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can go mushroom hunting and
spend time with my children.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, work on my tractor or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get my equipment, you know, do some
welding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a knife maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like blade smithing, you know,
so I got no shortage of.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of irons in the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Projects to work on, whatever metal work
thing, you know, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build a truck, building, you know,
my trucks or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I just like to keep busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with your light desk, are you doing
artificial light at other seasons or is it
[SPEAKER_02]: only sun, sun growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just supplementing just to,
you know, like sometimes we'll have like
[SPEAKER_01]: no sun for six weeks because there's a
fire and we have to have that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so I'll need to supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use, I'll use my HPS because I mean,
I got them and it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid like 300 bucks for, you know,
all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as somebody shutting down,
it worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know, it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel the best about it,
but it helps me stay in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, you know, that's about the
worst thing that I do is use some HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the most blessed soil I've come
across in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the worst thing I do for
real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it more light when there's no
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's like no light, I supplement
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll hit it a little bit and,
you know, finish it with at the end just
[SPEAKER_01]: to pop off, but it really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really hate the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, the plants literally tell me I
hate this spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I know, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for our eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing the best I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the banks would just, if I could just
get a loan from the banks would just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if we could just figure out this
fucking banking thing and I could just get
[SPEAKER_01]: the LED lighting that I need instead of
having to pay some stupid high rate just
[SPEAKER_01]: to get like the basic lighting I need,
which is like the most important tool when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like doing finished cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a fucking piece of shit saw you found
on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: With a fucking saw with teeth like that
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still making it look perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it grew there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still making it look like it grew
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what it, that's what,
that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I... So do you have stuff in
the cup this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just roll it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, no, I just, we rolled 150 joints
and we're just like gonna smoke everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't even, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just so busy doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even like get to town to really
enter and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably should have because this Mimosa
actually is like... Is that what this is?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but that, that, I think this one,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The joints that you guys rolled?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these, those are 24K.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this Mimosa, I mean,
you can see, you know, that's just like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis leaves and like some,
some, some thistle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fed like thistle, horsetail,
cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played with fennel?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it has that like licoricey mint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, I do, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, let me smell this and I'll let you
smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it like warms on the backside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty strong too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like a, I've got a big jar of it
and I'm blowing through the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm halfway through a large jar,
so I'm like damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Mimosa, is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mimosa that I've grown was,
it was a really nice sativa without being
[SPEAKER_02]: racy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's this one grow for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was like really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like freestanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: More indica style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't need any trellising basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It held its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it wasn't even trellised.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, didn't need any.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, the ones that I did didn't
even need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have just not done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the 24K had like three layers of
trellising was falling all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every which way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you pull 15 pounds from that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like three layers of trellising to just
try to hold it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a... Oh, you, you,
you did that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I've seen, like the living soil
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I had a full greenhouse full of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it quadrupled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I planted them in July 17th at the last
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like just clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean they were tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all whatever you could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got eight feet there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just, Patrick King, I got him up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came to the rescue, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the soil king.
[SPEAKER_01]: His little facility, his facility there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hooked me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: With those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got some others from somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just ran with what I could get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit the crunch, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you made it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the fact that I have any weed this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we ended up in the harvest box
with Organican as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were in there last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it was, I'm really honored
on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fight that we've been fighting,
it's, you know, it feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any win, anything good is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything positive is so huge right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just to connect with people and,
you know, just to be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feeds the soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's bringing us all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, I was like about as lone
wolf as anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you don't even come off the mound
for sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm about as lone wolf as if you
only knew, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you only knew the stories, you know,
so but it's 100% necessary for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, you know, I don't want to be
doing this necessarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to, you know, understand it in
myself and cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to cultivate that in myself so
I can become a better person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my, the things that I'm teaching my
children right now that have taken me this
[SPEAKER_01]: long to learn, I'm just like lighting them
up, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter is, that's why I say she's
pretty savage at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: They engage with you on a whole other
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's savage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about, this is like six months
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should see her flying knee like Tony
Joss style, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're teaching her all the tricks.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's savage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's a healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's learning to be a healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife's on the healer end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're teaching her to grow, you know,
grow, you know, grow food and medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to use them, how to protect people,
how to protect yourself, honor and respect
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and, and the earth, the people
around you and everything you do,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you work, walk through this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like, like cannabis,
like as an entity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that sound weird?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like coming out of the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's not having to be grown
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's shifted the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even in, I know like people who are
doing, yeah, we're going back,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going back 100% indoor, but it's in
living soil and it's changing the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's helping the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going back in time to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent on a lot of levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's been said many times lately
because it's, it's really a necessary,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, method.
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology to a mindset to focus on.
Okay.
