[SPEAKER_00]: The next person I'm going to have call up,
a call up here is from Angelus Emeralds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan Svetko is working the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole other thing going on in
the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jonathan is working his butt off too,
along with other people, to really make
[SPEAKER_00]: this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to jump up there so people can
see you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give Jonathan a hand.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again, Jackie, very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little over a year and a half ago,
we started this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember very clearly when we had
our first discussion in the county that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were fighting against the ban at the time
they were putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a whole six of us that showed up
to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since that time, the organization has
grown and we've had amazing partners join
[SPEAKER_01]: us, CCIA, DPA, Los Angeles Cannabis Task
Force.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to effect quite a lot of
change within the county itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really want to tell you here
more than anything else here tonight,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very proud to say that as of Friday,
the county has finally announced that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a working advisory group that
they have put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that for the next two months,
they will be working together hand in hand
[SPEAKER_01]: with the county to start forming
regulations so with any luck with the next
[SPEAKER_01]: few months, hopefully by January 1st,
we're going to have actual regulations for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to come out and start applying for
your licenses within the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick, quick facts I just want to put out
there because many people oversee this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see LA City as you well should.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within LA County, Unincorporated LA makes
up over 65% of the territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: 65% of the territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, please,
in the back over there, you'll find our
[SPEAKER_01]: booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris is going to be able to answer them
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here for you as well tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I can't stress enough what a
great thing this is that the county has
[SPEAKER_01]: actually moved the needle and we are
starting to work towards regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
