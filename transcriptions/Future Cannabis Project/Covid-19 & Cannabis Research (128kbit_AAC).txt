[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we are joined by two University of
Lethbridge researchers who have been
[SPEAKER_04]: researching COVID-19 and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Husband and wife team, the dynamic duo,
Igor and Olga Kovalchuk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give some background on kind of
what we know about what coronavirus
[SPEAKER_04]: attacks in the body and then kind of your
thought process in terms of solutions to
[SPEAKER_04]: either mitigate or eliminate coronavirus's
ability to do what it does?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll share the screen now and Olga will
give you a presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for organizing this
very interesting webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when coronavirus hit, we of course all
were kind of completely dumbfounded by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came out of nowhere and
essentially mixed up all the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then everybody in the world,
including us, started looking into what do
[SPEAKER_00]: we know about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we learn about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything we can do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that standpoint, because we were
previously working on medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we thought, okay, is there room for
medical cannabis there in our fight
[SPEAKER_00]: against COVID?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and what I'm going to talk today about
is a bit what we did in terms of bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis from mechanisms to
evidence-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we all have seen those pictures
and these are essentially our enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of what COVID-19 is,
so COVID-19 is a disease that's caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is highly
homologous to the first SARS virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly to the SARS virus,
SARS-CoV-2 interacts with ACE2 receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetic and geotensive converting
enzyme receptor, enzyme two receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it uses it essentially as a gateway
into the tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tissues that express ACE2 are oral
tissues, nasopharyngeal tissues,
[SPEAKER_00]: lung epithelial tissues, ovary epithelial
tissues, overall intestinal epithelial is
[SPEAKER_00]: also expressed in kidneys, it's expressed
in testes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tissues, specifically the airway
tissue, as well as the intestinal tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: are considered gateways of the virus,
because essentially how does virus gets
[SPEAKER_00]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either through airborne transmission,
whereby we breathe in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: particles that contain some of the,
not viral particles, but essentially it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a little droplets that contain
virus, so they go and they land on our
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alternatively, we can ingest something
that's contaminated, so it can get through
[SPEAKER_00]: also intestinal tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as such, what the virus does,
it interacts with ACE2 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it is brought in, kind of in the
minivysical that forms, it is brought into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell, whereby it is uncoated,
of course, and this is the RNA plus virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have then essentially it's RNA
being further used to produce more of its
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic material, as well as to produce
more of code protein and more of a code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then essentially the classical life
cycle of the virus, whereby later more
[SPEAKER_00]: virus is made and the tissues are
essentially being attacked further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course our, so this is from the very
recent paper with a very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: article in Nature talking about the role
of ACE2 receptor in SARS-CoV-2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the potential and the
hypothesis of the role of ACE2 overall in
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other very important feature about
COVID-19 disease is specifically the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that number one, it is a very,
very, it's a disease of a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have very, very light form of
disease, many people are asymptomatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas some people develop moderate
COVID, they would develop some,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, fever, cough, fatigue,
myalgia, and in many cases it goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pneumonia, of course, in terms of
severity can lead to essentially acute
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory distress syndrome and
respiratory failure and death,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereby we'll have up to, according to
different estimates, up to 20% of people
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a kind of more severe or moderate
to severe COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them will require IVL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of acute respiratory distress
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mechanisms of ARDS are another very
interesting aspect of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: ARDS is not a new phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: ARDS has been described to occur in SARS,
it occurs in MERS, it actually is really
[SPEAKER_00]: well known in very severe influenza cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key to it is what is a phenomenon
of what we call the cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereby we have a very significant
overproduction of IL-6, TNF alpha,
[SPEAKER_00]: IL-1 beta, the whole array of CCL,
and essentially the overstimulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-inflammatory cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have upregulation of other types
of inflammation markers, the reactive
[SPEAKER_00]: protein is up, and essentially
interleukin-10, so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have downregulation of the very
important molecules that we do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight, essentially to fight the virus
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a disbalanced storm, balanced
towards heavy pro-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when this was reported,
many groups, including our own,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we noticed that, again, interleukin-6
and TNF alpha are the key kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, perpetrators there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tocilizumab now is being trialed as a
potential to treat cytokine storm in
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19, and tocilizumab is a monoclonal
antibody blocking interleukin-6 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to that effect, colchicin went into
clinical trials, and with a potential also
[SPEAKER_00]: to inhibit cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lancet, in the beginning of May,
came up with a very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: correspondence, slash editorial,
talking about calling for new anti-TNF
[SPEAKER_00]: modalities that are needed to be trialed
against the cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to that effect, what we have been doing
before, and again, we haven't been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on COVID because COVID wasn't around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been working actually on
analyzing the medicinal properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together with Igor, his lab has
developed about 1,500 different new
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, different new hybrids,
marijuana-marijuana hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana-hemp hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we started doing is profiling
their extracts for their potential
[SPEAKER_00]: biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the questions we had, of course,
the big part of the story, we were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: into potential anti-cancer effects,
but we also were looking at a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had interest in, for example,
whether or not some of the effects can
[SPEAKER_00]: curb inflammation in oral tissues,
something along periodontal disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also focusing on effects on
intestinal tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is historical evidence
essentially from cases where people would
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that it is important in
inflammatory bowel disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, we had been working with
tissues that, as it appears, are gateway
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues for the virus itself, oral
tissues, airway, and intestinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have been inducing inflammation and
then treating with extracts, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects, as well as using batteries of
cell lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when COVID hit, we thought,
okay, first and foremost, let's take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look whether or not application of our
extracts affected ACE2 receptor itself on
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the way we do profiling after
treatment, we do NGS, and we do the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptome profiling with pathway
analysis to see what pathways are affected
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand the mechanisms of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the effects on the epi-oral
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have profiled several extracts,
as you can see, four, and then two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four, and nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is 13 extracts that were profiled in
two different experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have noted that on the level of
gene expression, the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptome, two extracts, 81 and 30,
were actually showing pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were several that were showing
the pretty solid trends in the epi-oral
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue in the second experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then went further and got the ACE2
antibody and tried to see what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening on the level of the protein,
because of course, that is really very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that several extracts actually
did down-regulate ACE2 expression on the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein level, which was quite promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the lung tissue and the
epi-airway tissue, we noticed that three
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts down-regulated expression of
ACE2, and there were some trends observed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the other two extracts, like 49 and
114, whereas the way extracts actually
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing quite the opposite,
which was quite interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have then, since then, repeated the
experiments using other models,
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually, we have seen pretty much the
same reproducible picture, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every extract behaves the same,
but what is really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's shown in the preprint that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have it in this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to compare the CBD to THC
ratios of these extracts, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively comparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all are high CBD lines, and there are
some lines that have, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 1 to 21, so THC to CBD, and one line is
active and the other one is not,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, again, pointing to the fact that
CBD is not just the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to cannabis than just CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in intestinal tissues, on the level of
transcriptome, we have seen one extract do
[SPEAKER_00]: spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extract number 45, and when we
further expanded that to the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: level, we noticed that, yes, extract 45
still did the best, and there were some
[SPEAKER_00]: other extracts that did show the activity,
extracts 1, 7, 129, and 169.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting aspect we noticed that
some extracts may be active on one tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: and inactive on the other one,
and right now, we are trying to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much do the array and compare
against the same extracts against the
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of tissues to identify
ones that are targeted multiple aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, cannabis is non-generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis does have, specifically,
extracts do have certain tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity, which, if you think in
biological terms, makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were also some interesting
findings that we found that we've seen on
[SPEAKER_00]: the level, again, of a transcript on
TMPRSS2, which is a serine protease that
[SPEAKER_00]: was reported by the group in Germany to be
important in, again, interaction with the
[SPEAKER_00]: spike protein, and it's important protease
that's involved in cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, there were pretty good
indicators of the effects in oral tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: and in intestinal tissue on the level of
TMPRSS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still looking in the lung tissue,
again, because a lot of it has been done
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but additional work we're doing in
the partial lockdown situation pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: probably is everybody else right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the story of the
cytokine storm crumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, as I mentioned, we have been
doing some work on anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: potencies of extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take the extracts and apply them
to tissues where we would induce
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation, and in this case,
we used human 3D full-sickness epidermal
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue, and induced inflammation using UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very strong induction of
inflammation as evidenced by TNF and by
[SPEAKER_00]: induction of other inflammatory markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will treat the extracts,
treat the tissues with the extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, harvest the tissues,
do the global transcriptome profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: and take a look at what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have preselected the extracts
with which we went forward, and further on
[SPEAKER_00]: zoomed into seven in the context of this
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of these seven, what was really
quite impressive, that extract number
[SPEAKER_00]: four, eight, and 14 were actually the most
effective in terms of the down-regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: TNF and interleukin-6 very profoundly,
and they also down-regulated a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of other inflammatory cytokines like
interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-26,
[SPEAKER_00]: interleukin-23, interleukin-17C,
which are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, the CCL-2, again,
one very, very important pro-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokine, and F-coppa-b was
down-regulated, TLR-2 was down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, was a very, very strong
response in terms of concerted
[SPEAKER_00]: down-regulation of inflammation markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at extract number six,
for example, the NSAID did down-regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: TNF as well as interleukin-6, but it
didn't really affect the other chemokines
[SPEAKER_00]: and cytokines, NF-coppa-b or TLR,
and actually CXCL-12 was up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at, for example, extract 13,
it didn't affect interleukin-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only affected TNF, and again,
it actually even up-regulated some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: CXCL molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And extract number 12, quite
interestingly, up-regulated interleukin-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extract number 15 did nothing,
so essentially there were no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: changes at all whatsoever on the level of
the entire transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were quite puzzled by this,
but again, what this signifies is,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, cannabis is non-generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very important to identify the
right strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, of course, will be an,
shouldn't say uphill battle, but will be
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a lot of work to be done if we were
wanting to identify the key molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the effect, because as you know,
there are so many cytokines, cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are so many terpenes, and of course,
the entourage effect is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is already a very important piece
of work, because again, we have three that
[SPEAKER_00]: are really good in this model,
and they can be developed further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, originally we were hoping to
work with them to develop them as within a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trial against rheumatoid
arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing that rheumatoid arthritis and
cytokine storm essentially share the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism, interleukin-6 and TNF are the
mechanism behind it, is actually they can
[SPEAKER_00]: be developed along both lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at the level of protein,
as you can see, it was pretty strong
[SPEAKER_00]: induction of inflammation, as seen here by
Cox, doing a little interleukin-6,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see that the extracts did
downregulate interleukin-6 and Cox to
[SPEAKER_00]: extra 15, if anything, kind of upregulated
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were differences, again,
between the extracts, but we can say that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the very, you know, extracts that
we found to be very interesting and potent
[SPEAKER_00]: actually can be further looked into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little snapshot of some of the
pathway analysis we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the facts of extract number
four on cytokine-cytokine receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction pathway, and you can see the
cytokines, the chemokines, and green in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case denotes downregulation,
so you can see the majority of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you look at extract 12,
this is the same pathway, we see
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is really very, very important to
start properly looking and selecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, and we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that just based on CBD to THC
ratio, because ratios are comparable,
[SPEAKER_00]: you hit the wrong strain, and you have
essentially an undesirable effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you upregulate things that you'd
want to downregulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this slide, this is a comparison of
rheumatoid arthritis CAG pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, as affected by extract number four
and extract number 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, again, significant and
very concerted downregulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway by extract four, and quite the
opposite actually by extract 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, speaking for the fact that cannabis
is non-generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to sum it up, this is where we think
cannabis versus COVID fights, the lines
[SPEAKER_00]: along which the cannabis versus COVID
fight can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one opportunity is blocking the
entry by interacting with ACE2 receptor as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as DMP2 and PRSS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is actually very
promising again, the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the cytokine storm, because
cytokine storms is a cause of acute
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory distress and multi organ
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potential to influence the levels
of the cytokines could lead to the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential clinical trial looking into,
for example, if people are dosed with the
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and we see how many of them do
develop severe disease and hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: admissions at a hope of decreasing the
disease severity, decreasing the hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: admissions, shortening disease duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that of course is, sorry, the slide
slightly jumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we have been doing before
COVID, focusing on cancer, on brain as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, for disease of CNS diseases,
neurological psychiatric, skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as inflammation, trying through
preclinical testing, identify the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that can then be used to formulate
clinical trials, focusing not just on
[SPEAKER_00]: safety, toxicity, tolerability,
but on quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course there have been some works
done along the quality of life improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, meaning affecting appetite,
sleep, pain, depression, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also focusing on disease improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some alliance that had very
significant anti-tumor effect and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping to see as a secondary outcome,
for example, one could look at the general
[SPEAKER_00]: tumor burden and the metastatic load,
or in context of, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: rheumatoid arthritis, whether or not we
could, along with quality of life and
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, also influence the disease scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, focusing on skin diseases,
skin aging, skin cancer, and in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, Parkinson's, dementia, stroke,
MS, and trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those are really pretty much
targets for future development in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and in the cannabis
research and hope when COVID is over,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have learned something from it,
we would have probably developed more
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies of developing clinical trials
and so on that can later be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: combating the other diseases and these are
the people on the teams with whom we work
[SPEAKER_00]: with, and I'll just go back space so that
we can keep cannabis and COVID here as our
[SPEAKER_00]: placeholder if we wish to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a question, and I'm not an
infectious disease person, I understand
[SPEAKER_05]: pathways, mechanism of action,
things like that, and I was wondering if
[SPEAKER_05]: you could address in a short sort of
layman's terms, are you saying that the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids are interrupting the ability
for ACE2 for the virus to bind and get
[SPEAKER_05]: into the cell and go into the
relationship, and maybe I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely, so you can correct me,
or is it the abilities are actually just
[SPEAKER_05]: reducing these cytokines and impacting the
cytokine storm, so is it affecting the
[SPEAKER_05]: symptoms or it is affecting the actual
mechanism of the virus getting into the
[SPEAKER_05]: cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there are two aspects there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we haven't studied the virus
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only looked at the effects of cannabis
on ACE2 receptor levels, and our
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis is that if ACE2 receptor levels
decrease, this may lead to low
[SPEAKER_00]: infectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have just submitted a proposal
to actually to test that hypothesis
[SPEAKER_00]: further, but that was our fundamental
preliminary data piece to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we were just to come up and say
cannabinoids may affect infectivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: people will say, what the heck,
why in the world are you thinking that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that it actually reduces the
expression of the receptor, it may lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and again, that has to be tested,
and we are hoping now with our colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: who have CL3, because we need a CL3 for
that, so we need to test that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, reducing that expression means
there are fewer receptors on the surface
[SPEAKER_08]: of the cell, so for any pathogen to infect
you efficiently, there should be a rate of
[SPEAKER_08]: infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: There should be a certain number of
infected cells per minute, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there are many viral particles
around and there are only few receptors to
[SPEAKER_08]: bind to, the virus may not have enough
time to interact and get into cells and be
[SPEAKER_08]: eliminated by immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, this finding led to
another hypothesis that we will now be
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, whether or not we will actually
affect the rate of infection itself in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues or in cells for now and in
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is, yes, the second one
is through the cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, you're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is by the anti-inflammatory mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: How exactly is it mediated through CB1,
CB2 receptors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking into that now, but we do
see on the level of pathway analysis that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is major downregulation of
pre-inflammatory pathways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with regards to the extracts,
I guess you're trying to figure out if
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a specific terpene or flavonoid
profile or different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess you're looking into that to
see separating out the ones where we're
[SPEAKER_05]: producing overexpression cytokines versus
downregulation cytokines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything there?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to probe into anything that
you might not want to report, but that's
[SPEAKER_05]: great.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I knew, I would let you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, we have started with 400
extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went down to 48 that have strong
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of these 48, we discarded high THC
ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: For one specific reason, most of the
doctors are not comfortable prescribing
[SPEAKER_08]: high THC and most of the patients would
likely not benefit from being constantly
[SPEAKER_08]: high while taking the medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they simply may refuse to use it,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So that means we focused about on 24,
let's say, that were high CBD or balanced
[SPEAKER_08]: one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And out of these, there are certain that
are active, certain are not.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not understand yet by erasures what
is active or what not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would have to do some so-called
fractionation where we do take fractions,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then see which one is the most active
and so-called reconstitutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we add these ingredients back and see
what is the minimum that is active and
[SPEAKER_08]: what is the maximum that is active.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think in terms of what's your
timeline like?
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like you're getting access to
your BCL3 lab and you're going to start
[SPEAKER_05]: working with virologists and they're going
to start doing some work with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what sounds like the direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much where we want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, we're now waiting for
the funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a play, you know, probably
globally right now, there is funding
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis everywhere in science, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of opportunities that have
been posted, we try to respond to every
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we hear and fingers
crossed, we hope to hear within a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether or not we do get the funding,
if we do get the funding, that will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually we'll form a, we've already
formed a big team that has several
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions involved, virologists,
clinicians, specialists in infectious
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, two independent BCL3 labs will
be conducting testing to make sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all of a sudden, because you know how
the funding rates now, if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: working, then we will still try to,
because again, these collaborations are
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll try to see what is the,
you know, the bare minimum we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is, you know, their pockets
are also not made out of rubber as ours
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't have funding, it will be
more difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Michael, in terms of moving forward,
we also are ready to go to clinical
[SPEAKER_08]: trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what Olga is describing is to identify
what are the mechanisms, what are the
[SPEAKER_08]: active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as the patient concerns and
concerned, we know that we have active
[SPEAKER_08]: extracts, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and now, so we want to do a clinical
trial, high CBD extracts should go through
[SPEAKER_08]: the safety and toxicity, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be sufficient to demonstrate
what's known in the literature,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So because it's been done many,
many times.
[SPEAKER_08]: So technically we just, I can go to
clinical trial phase two and demonstrate
[SPEAKER_08]: the efficacy of all the formulation with
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you guys think it's the CBD that's
the active ingredient here or is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it was great paper,
by the way, sorry to interject halfway
[SPEAKER_03]: through.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have already addressed the
question, but I read the paper and it
[SPEAKER_03]: looked as if you had a lot of extracts
that were behaving, but it didn't seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: correlate with CBD or THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's something else that's perhaps
at play.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so I just hypothesized that CBD may
be one of the active ingredients,
[SPEAKER_08]: but its activity definitely is modulated
by something else.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something else unlikely is THC
because we have extracts that have more or
[SPEAKER_08]: less same CBD to THC ratio and one of them
works, one of them does not, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it may be some minor cannabinoids,
it may be some terps, and their
[SPEAKER_08]: combination.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it will, if to do the science properly,
it may take two or three years until we
[SPEAKER_08]: know what active ingredients combination
is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, patients cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there is an active botanical
extract, why not study its effect more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you happen to, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I said, especially if it's high CBD
and it's considered as generally regarded
[SPEAKER_00]: as safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's a great path from a
regulatory standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you happen to see, there was a paper
out of Vietnam that screened 4,200
[SPEAKER_03]: different compounds out of the plants in
Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one that came at the top of their list
as a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor
[SPEAKER_03]: was cannabisin A, which was wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only find a couple papers on
cannabisin A.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I'm gonna probably murder the
pronunciation of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think curcetin is another one,
which is not necessarily unique to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But was found as another zinc ionophore,
which might behave like a
[SPEAKER_03]: hydroxychloroquine, but maybe not with the
arrhythmia issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been asking around and I don't
know of any people that are searching for
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cannabisin A is like molecular
weight of 594.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it falls off of some of the scans
people are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think curcetin might be a little
easier to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about where these are
expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cannabisin A is more in seeds,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I've read, from some HEMP papers
that Richard Rose sent me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I really don't know much about
the levels of curcetin in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, so basically botanical extracts
are very powerful.
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem with the new ones is if there
is no established safety and toxicities
[SPEAKER_08]: through monographs and literature,
it will take time in order to move to
[SPEAKER_08]: clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with ICPD extract, so if you claim
that CBD and THC and maybe some other
[SPEAKER_08]: major cannabinoids, if they're active
ingredient, you can go ahead to the
[SPEAKER_08]: clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the way the rules work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you guys for doing that so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just amazing that after a few
months into this, there's suddenly dozens
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis extracts screened against this
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a welcoming paper to read,
mainly because there has definitely been a
[SPEAKER_03]: backlash of people talking about the ECS
and COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you read into the literature of
this being an ROS disease, there being
[SPEAKER_03]: vascular stress going on, all the comorbid
patients seem to have some overlap with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis patients like cancer and COPD.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sister's like a vascular surgeon,
she sees this as an ROS disease in the
[SPEAKER_03]: vasculature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can quench that, you can make
tremendous strides on limiting cytokine
[SPEAKER_03]: storms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while there's no data that shows
any prescriptive dose one could use today,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's certainly reason to go and
investigate, like, what can we do in this
[SPEAKER_03]: space?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is a medicine that is not
going to be in short supply, if you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: can scale this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we know how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we were to go for a clinical trial,
of course, we will have dose escalation
[SPEAKER_00]: going in first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you build in a proper dose escalate,
even though it is the low THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: because dose escalation is crucially
important if you are really going into,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you start in reaching doses of THC
that are, you know, three milligrams and
[SPEAKER_00]: plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, but within a clinical trial,
that's all very, very doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in parallel, if we were, you know,
we're going for clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really hoping to start some to get
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in parallel, we will still be doing
the fundamental studies like that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: just discussed, trying to understand what
exactly is going on, trying to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, the exact mechanism,
the perpetrator as they call them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the good ones, and not the perpetrators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the good workers kind of in the
extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious, what is it like to get the
appropriate lab or to I noticed you were
[SPEAKER_03]: just talking about BO3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're at the intersection of handling
cannabis and BO3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be a really interesting
regulatory quagmire.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we have two.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't work with a live virus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and I've been working on medicinal
poppy for the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had license deal license for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and cannabis from 2016.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the measures are established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within BCL2 lab, you know, when we were
writing the proposal, many of us the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of us who are on the team,
we all have BCL2 labs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can work with lentivirus,
for example, or I can work with a viral
[SPEAKER_00]: replica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one essentially that will not
assemble into a particle, but that already
[SPEAKER_00]: is a huge probability, you know,
capacity to us to see whether or not we
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibit the replication of the virus
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were actually expecting to
get the replica from our colleague,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very soon, fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and then we're still discussing
actually with some regulatory folks here
[SPEAKER_00]: as to whether or not we can use
inactivated virus, like wild virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, within the BCL2 setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially the answer is yes,
but we don't have the full answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have gamma irradiated SARS here for
testing when we can use it in BL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got it from BEI resources here in the
States will offer it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a PCRs, even though it's gamma
irradiated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't, I've not put it on viruos
cells, it's not supposed to replicate in
[SPEAKER_03]: viruos cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's probably something that I'm
hoping that people who make this are
[SPEAKER_03]: checking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is a, it's an area we were asked to
look at a couple grows here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts got the trimming teams got
hit with COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were also concerned that there
was some, there's some bat guano,
[SPEAKER_03]: but getting used in the field and they're
finding all the coronaviruses and bat
[SPEAKER_03]: guano.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been just screening cannabis
samples to see if we can pick up COVID on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're ever going to find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not a replicate host there,
but I don't know, someone sneezes on it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's sick maybe, but that's probably a
lightning strike event.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we got familiar with this,
but we can't take in the replicated
[SPEAKER_03]: version of it either, unless we build the
BL3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what I've heard from my
colleagues, they were saying that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, as was in many labs in
Canada, they do allow the radiated virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just waiting to hear from our safety
to sign off on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they sign off, that's exactly what
we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the virus that, that's the
virus that all the testing companies are
[SPEAKER_05]: using to develop their tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty widely available.
[SPEAKER_05]: But getting into that BSL3,
[SPEAKER_05]: it seems though right now, you know,
right now is the point, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're dealing with where, you know,
folks that have information, good ideas,
[SPEAKER_05]: good hypothesis could push forward in ways
that typically would take forever to get
[SPEAKER_05]: something done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And nowadays it's like, how do we help?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I think, you know,
I think it's just, it's, it's really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, it's solid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's part advocacy,
part science, and, you know, doors are
[SPEAKER_05]: opening pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work in a couple areas, the COVID and
COVID response.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is, it is particularly remarkable
how quickly things are moving just as much
[SPEAKER_05]: as what, as what you've been, what you've
been doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, I've got a lot of faith
that you're going to be able to find the
[SPEAKER_05]: right virology partners in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, you know, now's, now's the time
we need to be working fast and science is
[SPEAKER_05]: if we're, you know, just, it's,
it's really impressive what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really, really honored that,
that you've taken the time out to,
[SPEAKER_05]: to, to put your data out there and allow a
general audience as well as scientific
[SPEAKER_05]: audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see a lot of the funding starting to
open up in the, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: with regards to COVID and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: If something pops up, there is some tiny,
tiny amounts of funding for cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: with regards to pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know where they might open the,
they might open up a grant function.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, you know, I'm paying attention
to at least the, the federal grants coming
[SPEAKER_05]: through as something that, that,
that, that shows, that, that sort of dials
[SPEAKER_05]: into what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll forward those links on to you and see
if, see if you can help, see if,
[SPEAKER_05]: see if we can, we can get some funding to
help you in that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, you know, any, anything we can
do to help you know, we're all in this
[SPEAKER_05]: together and, and you're definitely a tip
of the spear.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
it's quite, quite, you know, I'm kind of,
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of speechless over it because I'm
still processing the data that you
[SPEAKER_05]: presented, but it's, it's quite good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it really, it really looks like if
you could separate out any strain,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, any, any indication separating a
positive, the over expressors from the,
[SPEAKER_05]: from the, from the future expressors,
you know, that really should be a,
[SPEAKER_05]: a way forward to say, Oh, no, this is,
you know, that, because that's that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that seems to be the biggest safety issue
that you can see, at least with the in
[SPEAKER_05]: vitro data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I run into any of the folks that might be
able to come to bear to help you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will send them in your direction as
quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So correct me if I get this wrong,
but it seems like you found that a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: extract, certain strains are more or less
effective in certain past or older through
[SPEAKER_02]: the lungs or through the skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if so, do you have a theory why that
might be the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there are some strains that
are actually show what I would call
[SPEAKER_00]: potential tissue specificity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be due to the fact, I would say
probably has to do something with
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, not being
absolutely actively expressed in every
[SPEAKER_00]: cell and tissue type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be kind of, you know,
my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying now to look into this
because, but in parallel, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to identify the strains as I
will call them, you know, multipotence,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the ones that will hit all
tissues properly, rather than trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, this is a good strain for oral
vessels, this is a good strain for
[SPEAKER_00]: intestinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the roots are somewhere in the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you use obviously extracts to do your
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my takeaway was for anyone who's
listening to this, that the probable
[SPEAKER_02]: method of use of anything that comes out
of this would be extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would take that form.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't be smoking or vaping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that type or how do you see that
happening?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the delivery method can be any,
but you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's better to extract what's
in there, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So probably solvent based extract is the
best, like ethanol, because it takes all
[SPEAKER_08]: sorts of molecules, not only lipophilic,
like CO2 dust, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but all the others.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's essential.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the delivery can be a nasal spray
mouse, or even inhaler, right,
[SPEAKER_08]: to this effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: But right, I have no idea what we will get
from smoking, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would second that because actually I was
talking to one of the colleagues who is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pulmonologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially to that effect,
sorry, we have a little interruption here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the form of our cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I was talking to a pulmonologist
and what he suggested that actually trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it in the medical type of an
inhaler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something akin to the one that is used,
for example, for Ventolin where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of smoking, no, we did not
look because smoking also creates tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rare articles that have suggested
that smoking itself may, like smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes, may shoot combustion products,
may influence the ACE2 and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we were a little bit uneasy
about that, but the idea is either a
[SPEAKER_00]: mousewash or a nebulizer or medical type
inhaler, or actually using some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts in pill form, in oral form.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the cat going to make a cameo?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all want to see the cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron, when we are done, we'll show the cat.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have quite a number of cats and one of
them getting impatient, so hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was just calling to me and trying
to.
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually really twice pushed the
computer by the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I was trying to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing something on the side,
I was just trying to keep the cat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever is going on may well be
independent of THC and or CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it could be a minor cannabinoid,
it could be terpenes that are doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, I mean, can we say what components
of cannabis is doing this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the headlines that are picked up
by the general press or CBD shows,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what you guys said.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's understandable why they are
saying that, because CBD is a big market
[SPEAKER_08]: in the US and every person or every
company that produces it wanted to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: big story so that they can sell more
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have talked to so many and we always
say it is not CBD, it is not CBD,
[SPEAKER_08]: but everyone who reads and wants to hear
it say it's CBD, it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just stopped.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no point of arguing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the thing, because the title
says high CBD cannabis extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't read beyond high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's cannabis extracts and the
keyword is cannabis extracts, not CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, people read that and they
sort of focus on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a combination of several,
because definitely it's entourage effect
[SPEAKER_00]: in work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what it's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just putting a link in the notes here
for that paper that talks about a few of
[SPEAKER_03]: the main protease inhibitors, cannabis and
A is one that popped up on that radar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Peter was offline when we were
discussing that, but there's the link.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like Kevin, when I look at the
numbers in your paper and trying to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find any rhyme or reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so fascinating why certain
strains will be effective and others that
[SPEAKER_02]: have close rations are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a mystery in the making.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mystery that needs to be solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with the lines of specific
pathways, keys to tissue specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that mystery can hold the keys
to tissue specificity.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you pursue your research, which is the
most important avenue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it trying to identify other
cannabinoids, the useful ones and less
[SPEAKER_02]: useful ones or pathways or which do you
see a priority to the type of research
[SPEAKER_02]: that needs to be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from my side, I see kind of two
key priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would want to see number one is
more clinical research on the currently
[SPEAKER_00]: identified ones to see whether or not we
can do, for example, a small scale phase
[SPEAKER_00]: one to kind of essentially primary phase
two, but we'll have a little bit of phase
[SPEAKER_00]: one if need be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but in parallel, looking into these
specific modes of action, the links
[SPEAKER_00]: between the role of endocannabinoid system
in governing the effects that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing specifically in context,
for example, the cytokine storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it looks like from the preliminary
data we have already some on the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, there is some correlation,
of course, with the key receptors CB1,
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2, we are looking at the other ones,
but that is also kind of fundamentally for
[SPEAKER_00]: research kind of study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be the avenue where I would want
to go in terms of more fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me, yeah, now I'm just showing,
so this is what Kevin just sent to
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will put that in a link to the video
after the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: One question I have is between the two of
you, you have a lot of peer-reviewed
[SPEAKER_04]: studies out there, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my question is, this is not
peer-reviewed, it's pre-print,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So why did you feel that, was there an
urgency to get this information out there
[SPEAKER_04]: now rather than later?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how long, well, probably the
colleagues know how long it takes to
[SPEAKER_08]: publish a paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be four months, it may be four
years, and I'm not joking, some papers
[SPEAKER_08]: take four years to publish.
[SPEAKER_08]: So especially if it's a controversial
story, the reviewers will ask again for
[SPEAKER_08]: more and more and more information.
[SPEAKER_08]: You may go through 20 different journals,
20, I'm not kidding, until you get it
[SPEAKER_08]: published.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have submitted it to peer-review,
it's been in peer-review, first story,
[SPEAKER_08]: been there for about three weeks or two
months, and second, we submitted at the
[SPEAKER_08]: same time, we put it out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're right, because of the time's
essence, and we really wanted to recruit
[SPEAKER_08]: some potential partners who would pay for
commercial trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked to many different agencies,
you know, no one give you money just
[SPEAKER_08]: because just like that, and I was thinking
if we make a public outcry, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna happen, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but the other thing is also in
order for even to get applying for grants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have some preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, granting agencies would
say, one thing is I will say, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: preliminary data and give you a picture,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is if I think it is complete
enough to be able to put it out there into
[SPEAKER_00]: a form of preprint because they are still,
you know, you have comments, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions, people post often times,
sometimes some comments are general,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes people suggest quite very
interesting things that could be added or
[SPEAKER_00]: one could look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, that was to put it out,
to put it out to see what people will say
[SPEAKER_00]: to attract attention of other people who
may be doing similar research,
[SPEAKER_00]: that immediately led to actually us
forming a team and applying now for CHR.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as a preprint was out,
one of the colleagues who was working in
[SPEAKER_00]: the similar field said, oh, I just saw
your preprint, we're working along the
[SPEAKER_00]: same lines, let's collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, because we may not
necessarily know who else is doing what,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this led to more synergy and
collaboration, which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, one of the really good
scientists, Antje Baranova, she works in
[SPEAKER_00]: aging, she was given a couple of seminars,
and one thing she pointed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: she said, you know, right now people
started posting their stuff on preprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are not trying to make a paper
to be perfect and to go as high as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they see something, and they can see
the use of it, and they can see importance
[SPEAKER_00]: in following up and carrying more
research, they will post and then say,
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, of course, being reviewed now,
but it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sharing, it enables quicker sharing of
results rather than steam cooking it and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make, you know, a big runny nose
splash and shoot the paper, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: into a 20-impact journal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding layers and layers, we may be
more catalyzed in collaboration that will
[SPEAKER_00]: later lead to way more bigger papers or
bigger teams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think during pandemics like
this, the preprints get more scrutiny than
[SPEAKER_03]: the peer review.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can go online and see 100
different comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember that, there was a paper
that came out talking about an uncanny
[SPEAKER_03]: similarity between HIV and SARS-CoV-2,
and it kind of riled up a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: conspiracy over this thing being
bioengineered, and it got wrecked,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, in the course of a weekend with 100
people showing why it was wrong,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the authors agreed and pulled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't get that all the time in a
peer review, particularly during an
[SPEAKER_03]: epidemic like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the reviewers are reviewing COVID
papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I've had one I submitted January
5th, and I probably won't see anyone touch
[SPEAKER_03]: it for six months because it's not related
to COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the reviewers are getting recruited
for this topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and when it does get reviewed,
it's going to have maybe three people that
[SPEAKER_03]: review it, and I won't know who they are,
and I may not necessarily get to see their
[SPEAKER_03]: comments, depending on the journal,
whereas when you put these preprints out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see all the color in the
commentary of these things, whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: polite or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets rolled out there on Twitter and on
your paper, and I think it's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: really refreshing that we have this outlet
now, and everyone should, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: read the paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the preprints with a little grain of
salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the comments sections, too,
to see what other people are saying about
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always really helpful, but I,
you know, waiting six months for
[SPEAKER_03]: information like this to get out,
just think about what that does throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire scientific community if
everyone's paper is in isolation and in
[SPEAKER_03]: quarantine for embargo for six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it really limits the metronome on
innovation by doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting these preprints out, other people
can start working on it before it's fully
[SPEAKER_03]: reviewed, and I think it's the way to go
in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to improve on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, there's going to be papers that
slip through that create, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the media takes them and runs with them in
the wrong direction, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get better at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we really need to speed up the
rate at which these things get reviewed
[SPEAKER_03]: for the peer review process to keep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing about the media coverage
also is that, you know, out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, just take the headlines and run with
them, and I've seen a whole bunch of that
[SPEAKER_02]: on the... going, yeah, I'm protected,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it, you know, and I'm curious,
you guys, if there's a message you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: put out there to people who might be
getting the wrong message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, because we have heard
this, Tom, you're absolutely right on
[SPEAKER_00]: target when people will say, oh,
I have been using cannabis recreationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: so COVID ain't going to hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the fact that, you know,
people have been using cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they have been using cannabis for
medical purposes, even people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not necessarily mean that then you
are, you know, protected and it shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: give people false hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key of this study is that,
number one, we have shown pre-clinically
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are reasons to believe that
cannabis has the potential to be effective
[SPEAKER_00]: in fighting against COVID, enough to
believe that we can conduct clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clinical trials is the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before the trials are conducted,
I don't think it is responsible to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis besides the fact that
cannabis is non-generic will do X,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't looked at smoking and in
general, combustion products getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: the lungs, they do influence H2 system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, again, with a grain of caution
there, but the key message is we are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to create a medicine rather than a
false hope and trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go the same way as every pharmaceutical
company has to go about it, conduct your
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will let you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate your time and I hope this
was a little more interesting for you to
[SPEAKER_04]: talk to other scientists than to talk to
like the press.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the first scientific one we've done
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's forced today, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But the first scientific one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do hope we stay in touch
because we now have each other's emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sending those links.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want to hope we will continue
communicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I have a question for Kevin while we
have him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Kevin, like, what is the current
state of research collaboration around
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis just now, generally speaking,
in the middle of a pandemic?
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone knows, you should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's been challenging because some
labs are shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know that I spoke to Roger
Coffey a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: His lab in Israel got shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the godfathers of our space can't
get to get the lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's open now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, there's a period where that
was shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got saved by the grace of good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're considered essential because we're
making reagents for testing for pathogens
[SPEAKER_03]: on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cannabis industry was deemed
essential here in Mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't get shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I know a lot of other
people that have that complicate this.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the academic laboratories,
actually, are on half staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're wanting to collaborate with
people in Cambridge, they're kind of on
[SPEAKER_03]: hit or miss schedules right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also, I think, a big migration for
a lot of people in the space to start
[SPEAKER_03]: getting pulled into the vortex of studying
this, which is naturally challenging,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, for any small company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you pivot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should you pivot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should you be looking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at this right now, is it going to
go away in six months and we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: waste all of our effort on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are unknowns, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of risk for small entities to
make pivots like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly hope there's more work like
what they're doing because I think there's
[SPEAKER_03]: so much hope and promise in the ECS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today, if you're a physician,
you really can't recommend this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't say, hey, yeah, you should take
cannabis because of one esoteric HCV paper
[SPEAKER_03]: that's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what the FDA would approve of.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really controlling of the language
around medical use.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, if I were a physician
and someone asked me, should you stop
[SPEAKER_03]: taking your meds, I'd be equally
frustrated with my answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you should change course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably veer away from smoking it
and maybe stick with more edibles than you
[SPEAKER_03]: can with anything that might irritate your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wouldn't want to be in the position
of telling somebody that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you should stop taking the medicine that's
working for you because we don't know what
[SPEAKER_03]: this is going to do with this particular
virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the numbers and the frequency
which just infects people right now is
[SPEAKER_03]: extraordinarily low.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it's a complicated time
without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly affected us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pivoted a little bit of effort toward
trying to detect this as a foam light,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's going to be in the
environment anywhere and people's
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer or on trimmers or on plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a test that can pick
up COVID on SARS-CoV-2 at least on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to get high use
for a long period of time, but we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be caught flat-footed if it ever
breaks out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it ever gets found that one of these
dispensaries or grows that have employees
[SPEAKER_03]: that had COVID put something on an inhaled
product by accident and it makes it to a
[SPEAKER_03]: patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our industry, we shut down overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that scares the hell out of us that if
we don't have that test, it's a liability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're building things as insurance
policies that may never get used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might be deemed a distraction in a
year from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's definitely chaos,
I think is the right term for what's going
[SPEAKER_03]: on right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The scientists are now, and I'm on a
couple of collaborations too, have put
[SPEAKER_05]: proposals out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems as though we can't do the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Writing in Zoom meetings are basically the
nature of science has turned into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is a happy ending here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I read something from the DOD,
they're issuing a Newton Award.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their whole description was when
Newton was dealing with the black,
[SPEAKER_05]: when they had the black death,
did you see that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That he was on furlough and he figured out
gravity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, we're all sort of like the
right people to be stuck with the pandemic
[SPEAKER_05]: right now, because we're the guys that
would be like, okay, I have time on my
[SPEAKER_05]: hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to get stuff done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the skill set to go do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all starting to change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as scientists, we're getting,
yes, there's some competitiveness and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's egos involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is this, the collaborative
effort I think is returning to the
[SPEAKER_05]: sciences where over years and years and
years of funding cuts and difficulties and
[SPEAKER_05]: selling our souls to VCs at times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the VCs are now, the money is
looking at, there's a lot of funding
[SPEAKER_05]: coming into COVID.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is a sort of like,
okay, let the experts do what they need to
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't put them under your thumb.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is an appreciation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a renewed appreciation for the
scientists doing their job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going into the whole concept of these
preprints, like this was just a good idea
[SPEAKER_05]: internally among scientists.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now everybody knows how to get access
to the first data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's kind of a deuteristic
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas scientists were, we have to
advocate for certain things and exercise
[SPEAKER_05]: caution in an environment and actually
accomplish the job of solving these
[SPEAKER_05]: problems in record times in the context of
this tremendous amount of chaos and
[SPEAKER_05]: chatter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're all trained,
we're all kind of trained to deal with a
[SPEAKER_05]: level of chaos, just not in a global
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of my thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of, I'm a little bit of idealistic,
but when I saw that, the fact that the
[SPEAKER_05]: description of what happened with Newton,
I was like, oh great, we're ready for a
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific boom if we could just get past
a little bit of the chaos and manage to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep our you know, keep some integrity
with the fact that we're the guys that are
[SPEAKER_05]: both the skeptics and the ones that have
to say, you know, okay, everybody calm
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, are you actually zooming
from a boat right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm zooming from a boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am quarantine in this place imaginable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give us a shot of your view?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what kind of boat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flip the camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So ordinarily, it's a little bit cloudy
today, but ordinarily there'd be kayakers
[SPEAKER_06]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're all socially distanced by nature
of the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in Marina Del Rey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you in Connecticut?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in Connecticut?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in Beverly mass and the background is
so boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to put up something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, that's a pretty wild
background.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, how do you, how did you,
you know, I was, I was about to ask you
[SPEAKER_06]: like to zoom out, like adjustable
background stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green screen function on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put any pick up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a picture that a phased
genovic sent me of a Jamaican lion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work on the genome and sent us a
portrait of this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's become my zoom background.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, brought a smile to our faces.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think this whole, you know,
like, and I want to address your point
[SPEAKER_05]: about that this might be gone in six
months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the virology community is starting
to realize that, that we will,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we'll get through COVID,
but this will, this will be a normal thing
[SPEAKER_05]: where the, the, the, the rapid preparation
and knowing what to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: hands down the next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think this whole, everybody's
real.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, none of us are virologists.
[SPEAKER_05]: My virology friends are out of work right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, you're, you know,
you're getting promoted.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, there's a lot of the
virologists didn't really get a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the, a lot of the boom, you know,
everything went into, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, cancer, you know, you name it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the virologists are, are,
you know, they're, I think it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, it's, it's going to bring some news.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to bring some new
scientific assets to the storyline that
[SPEAKER_05]: from, from, you know, collaborators and
colleagues that, you know, we're,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not really getting a fair,
fair, you know, getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: able to, able to get careers out of what
they were doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, so I think there's,
there's some realignment going on and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, the smart will,
you know, I don't want to say the strong
[SPEAKER_05]: will survive, but it's kind of like the
smart will, will make it through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of have a lot of faith in
science now, like after, after stepping
[SPEAKER_05]: away from science and coming back into
science and be like, do I want to put up
[SPEAKER_06]: with this shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I want to do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And to, and to realize that this is what
we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's, you can't take this away
from what this is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do it no matter what.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's, it's going to lend some,
some new, some new eyes and ears to the,
[SPEAKER_05]: to the, to our, to our world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's certainly a, I think
everyone in the investment community was
[SPEAKER_03]: not expecting cannabis to be deemed
essential through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if there was any investor that was
worried about federal legalization and if
[SPEAKER_03]: it would reverse itself, I think those
fears are over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having seen it survive this is something
that I think is a real strong testament
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and I, you know, I've been kind of
scratching my head as to why, like how the
[SPEAKER_03]: hell did we luck out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, what, what happened that this,
that was deemed this way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's the medical base, you know,
they, they're really worried that if all
[SPEAKER_03]: these patients ran to the hospital right
now to get alternative meds, it'd be a
[SPEAKER_03]: disaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just to leave them open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I mean, every state was
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass only led medical be open and closed
rec and they're opening rec now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and you know, of course those people
are going to revert back to getting cards
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of them are going to go to the
black market and there could be issues
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there, you know, what was kind of
interesting through all this is we were
[SPEAKER_03]: just dealing with this valley thing and
you know, a valley came to the table with
[SPEAKER_03]: very similar symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it had a ground glass opacities
in the lungs and created pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has any evidence is infected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's infectious and you know, it's
probably vitamin E acetate, but it was
[SPEAKER_03]: just starting to tail off.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing came on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so naturally there's people here that
were, you know, Charlie Baker was quite
[SPEAKER_03]: concerned about a valley and made it,
you know, close a lot of the vape shops
[SPEAKER_03]: down in the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, the conditions I've spoken
to is like, what happens when these two
[SPEAKER_03]: things intersect?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when these things have similar
symptomatology they probably exacerbate
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a real problem, but you know,
I was seeing that wave as, oh no,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is going to crash the cannabis market
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next thing you know, oh,
you're essential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our investors and on any other
investors in space just kind of did a 180
[SPEAKER_03]: on that saying, wait a minute,
you guys are, you know, you're in
[SPEAKER_03]: volatility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're, you're, you're non
correlated to the rest of the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're open and everyone's closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to park more money in those types
of businesses because they're likely to
[SPEAKER_03]: sustain the next shutdown that's going to
occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We those just chalk it up as things you
would never predict.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I got brought in through some clear
labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pairing up with cannabis testing
labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the clinical labs that deal with to
deal with, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was, it was just this odd,
all of a sudden I was on a zoom call and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, and there was all these scientists
all from the either CLIA labs,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis testing lab, environmental
testing labs, health testing labs,
[SPEAKER_05]: all trying to bring assets and capacity to
the scenario.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in California, uh, they didn't,
they didn't really, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_05]: still not sure whether they're going to
allow cannabis labs to, to, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: to, to switch doing clinical labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you basically have the people,
you know, you basically have your assets.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just, you know, there's a,
just a couple of things to go through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so, so there was a whole little
organization that we started, we renamed
[SPEAKER_05]: it pandemic laboratory action network.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it literally was just all these
different equipment suppliers and reagent
[SPEAKER_05]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and it's, it, you know,
things started to pair off and some of
[SPEAKER_05]: these families testing labs started to
reorient completely to get, to get CLIA
[SPEAKER_05]: certified, to handle the overflows.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been a, you know, this is really
like in an area where the cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_05]: labs were getting hit hard and then the
CLIA labs are doing okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was on the clinical side of
things, there was a whole bottoming out of
[SPEAKER_05]: the CLIA labs in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were the perfect storm, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you were one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, yeah, we got out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were a CLIA lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so you were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is actually topic number two I
wanted to jump into.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let, let's start with kind of an intro
to the topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically in all these states,
they're kind of bottlenecks of testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's CLIA stand for?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the acronym?
[SPEAKER_03]: Clinical Laboratory Proving Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bottlenecks in terms of,
you know, if we want to test large
[SPEAKER_04]: portions of populations, we, we just,
we don't have the capacity right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have the PCR capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the regulatory capacity,
if you will, to get a CLIA license can
[SPEAKER_03]: take you a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took us probably two or three years to
get it in New York, at least for DNA
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing, which is maybe a little bit
more complex, but they are still asking
[SPEAKER_03]: for high complexity laboratory CLIA
licenses for COVID testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a fast process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You usually have to get CAP involved,
which is the, I think it's the College for
[SPEAKER_03]: American Physicians to come in and audit
your laboratory and look at all your
[SPEAKER_03]: workflows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's a, it's a, it's a long,
I would say it does make sense to do for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, sequencing where you're,
you might be making life or death
[SPEAKER_03]: decisions on someone like with a BRCA
mutation and whether they're going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, do a cancer biopsy or,
or, or cut something off, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but PCR, is really simple and people can
do some of this in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we want there to be all types of
great audit trails, I think cannabis labs
[SPEAKER_03]: are fully capable of doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have those things in place and they
can track samples and patients can always
[SPEAKER_03]: get retested when there's error.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's a host of, no one's
expecting these tests right now to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred percent sensitivity and
specificity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all know that there are false
negatives and they're all false positives
[SPEAKER_03]: from the tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that in most cases, hospital settings
are requiring multiple tests to release
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody just to have some error
correction in the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think if there's really a
shortage, I'd rather have labs like
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis labs and know how to run QPCR
running the excess capacity than not
[SPEAKER_03]: running anything at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, that I think is doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, that's, that's, that's
challenging to get the FDA to necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Michael, that's kind of what all,
so these cannabis testing labs in
[SPEAKER_04]: California have kind of come together and
stepped up to try to basically repurpose,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, their capabilities to COVID-19
testing, correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the, it's, well, it's not
just the camp.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a, there's a, there's a,
the whole, when it comes down to testing
[SPEAKER_05]: and folks that have PCR, I mean,
Robert probably can, he knows this,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he knows better than I do,
which sounds like, cause he's been in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have basically a clinical
tradition of testing labs in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a clinical trajectory that labs
are in, and then you have pretty much
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis testing labs are in the
everybody else category.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the wording in there's CLIA
waivers, but you can't, you can't get a
[SPEAKER_05]: CLIA waiver for high complexity testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's employee, you know, there's like
several different, you have to have board
[SPEAKER_05]: certified CLIA, you know, CLIA accredited
staff that are already certified for the,
[SPEAKER_05]: to do this type of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause in a lot of it is logistics and
knowing, you know, knowing what the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: safety and health and being able to,
to, to, to operate in a, in a high
[SPEAKER_05]: complexity fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's, you know, these,
these folks go through training
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The equipment was, equipment and reagents
are the biggest supply chain issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reagents were key.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, in a lot of these labs,
there's folks that have already have,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they have deep net deep networks
in terms of reagents and supplies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so the bottlenecks have been,
you know, reagents and equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the thinking was that if we can
just activate, you know, get, get labs
[SPEAKER_05]: activated and you know, there,
there hasn't, you know, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the, it's an entrepreneurial art.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you have a lab you have to get
through some certifications.
[SPEAKER_05]: California, there has been some,
you know, some descriptions that because
[SPEAKER_05]: they can't do the site visits,
the CLIA, some, some CLIA labs are being
[SPEAKER_05]: approved in a, in a, in a rather expedited
fashion to, to sort of increase that
[SPEAKER_05]: capacitance and increase that capacity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a day of phone, a day of phone
calls talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's some different assays
that are, that are not, that don't require
[SPEAKER_05]: as much complexity.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's these isothermal assays that are
coming out that are, that are based on a,
[SPEAKER_05]: on a, not needing a thermo cycler or
needing, you know, needing as much
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment in order to achieve a,
get a desired result.
[SPEAKER_05]: There, there's tests that are,
you know, that, that we're done in low
[SPEAKER_05]: resource countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So countries that didn't have resources
and didn't have the types of equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: that we have here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, there's some different techniques
that are being approved in by the FDA
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a small, small handful of it,
small handful in comparison to like the
[SPEAKER_05]: general PCR.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the, the, the nature is, is,
you know, it's a, it's an actively
[SPEAKER_05]: evolving scenario.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think anybody has the answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we don't really, we are a biotech
rich country.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have tremendous, we have all the
equipment we need.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reagents are the problem,
but we have the scientific capacities,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have the technical capacities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a matter of just trying to,
how do, how do we line this up and how do
[SPEAKER_05]: we get this moved in a fashion that if
we're dealing with percentages of testing
[SPEAKER_05]: that is theoretically needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you follow the Harvard study,
it's somewhere in between, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: two to two to 5%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even more of the country would have to be
tested on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the, if that's the modality of
to control the control and the pandemic,
[SPEAKER_05]: nobody really has the, I can't say that
everybody has the answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that some leaders are really,
you know, they're working really hard to,
[SPEAKER_05]: to, to, to dig deep and, and, you know,
put their liaisons and trying to get these
[SPEAKER_05]: labs, get them whatever they need as
quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: City of LA has been, you know,
the City of LA announced two weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Garcetti said, anyone who needs a
test can get a test.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be defined by having
symptomology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that was a step in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so literally on the city, the county,
the state, even the feds, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's trying to work to,
to, to get these labs active and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and as well as, you know, here's your
billing code, go to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there was a lab in Irvine that,
that Irvine, California, that was a clean,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they were, you know,
they were originally from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: testing area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had a cannabis testing lab,
but they also had a CLIA lab set up and
[SPEAKER_05]: they, you know, they were breaking down
walls and expanding their CLIA capacity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CDC came in and said, you know,
you now, you know, you now work for Uncle
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a tremendous amount of back load
and they just started throwing sand,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, not throwing, but, you know,
sending them samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, now they, you know,
now they've been them sort of activated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is, you know, it's boots on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think any testing, anyone who's
working in this environment is,
[SPEAKER_05]: is a, you know, has to be some boots on
the ground, some entrepreneurship,
[SPEAKER_05]: networking, and, and getting moving,
getting, you know, if you don't have the
[SPEAKER_05]: approvals, you know, don't, you know,
don't take me, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: don't take no for an answer and kind of,
kind of, you know, work it through,
[SPEAKER_05]: through, you know, whatever, you know,
whatever needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great that we had cannabis
regulatory people that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: pouring over CLIA, you know, Rhett,
you know, this, you probably got through
[SPEAKER_06]: this with the, with the, like,
you know, okay, I've got this set of
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations and now I've got to deal with
this set of regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I put the two together?
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now I think Lori's, Lori Ajax in
California has been like, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could do either or, but I don't think
they wanted to commingle.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was just maybe some, you know,
imaging, you know, some thoughts of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: how do you, how do you do both?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, you know, it just made, I don't know
whether it was an image or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they just were still trying to get their
heads around it of, of, of, of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what, what would it be like if a
cannabis testing lab were to engage in
[SPEAKER_05]: these more advanced, you know,
getting into high complexity testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, the staffs, like you said,
you know, the staffs are there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them, you know, a lot of folks
came from CLIA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's not probably better
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you look at a lot of the CLIA
labs, they oftentimes get very specialized
[SPEAKER_03]: in a few niche areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we had DNA sequencers and QPCR
instruments in our CLIA laboratory,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we didn't have mass specs,
ICPs, all these other tools that might
[SPEAKER_03]: actually be very helpful at studying
COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I hear your people trying to pick
some of these things up with peptide
[SPEAKER_03]: scans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who knows what they'll,
they'll create.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really excited when I heard people
were trying to bring them in involved
[SPEAKER_03]: because I like the cannabis labs and that
they have such diversity of
[SPEAKER_03]: instrumentation that they're likely to
bring a couple other innovative ideas into
[SPEAKER_03]: the picture once they start get in,
once they start moving on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it does come to CLIA.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should put you in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone who works on CanMed here,
Doug Kennedy is involved in LA doing
[SPEAKER_03]: testing with Sean Penn.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some network out there that's
doing like, 10,000 tests a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know who they're, they're
channeling the actual work through.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more on the set up the tents and
out in parking lots and, and, and get the
[SPEAKER_03]: sample collection going, but they might
get off the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just set up at the Dodger Stadium,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to use this time to tell my
anecdotal Los Angeles testing story
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure everyone is, is doing their best,
but after the mayor announced that anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: could get tested, my wife called up and
made an appointment for her and my son.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I decided not to do it,
to drive down to Carson and get tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which is far from where we live,
over an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went, they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were told 36 hours, they would get
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's maybe 10 days later, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No results, no call, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, whatever they were to tell us
is meaningless now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told her this morning, I go,
you know, I ask her every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, has anyone contact, you know,
doctors are supposed to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, they, she, she did contact and they
go, we're behind and doctors will be
[SPEAKER_02]: contacting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told her, had it been me,
I, I, I'd be raising, I'd be, I'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: really making a stink.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I can say because it's,
you know, in, in, in the trying to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the most constructive way possible,
because I know, I don't believe it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I, I believe everyone's trying
their best, but obviously the testing
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity, the lab capacity isn't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an, that's a good story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the system is, the system
is stressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got, you know, it's, it's,
and how do you, you know, you want a
[SPEAKER_05]: bitch, normally you'd be able to bitch a
bitch at somebody, but now you can't,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, now they're too busy to get,
they're too busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to, you know, I mean,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was quite, you know, it's like,
it's, it's funny, but it's not funny,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gallows humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at how quickly this fired up in
South Korea and it was a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: embarrassing being a, in United States
where PCR was invented and we're here
[SPEAKER_03]: tripping over ourselves, trying to get
this running.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that we don't know how to run
PCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have enough of the thermal
thermo-cyclers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have enough of the laboratory
staff that are CLIA approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in a CLIA setting, you have to
like submit your resumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have people on staff that don't
have less than certain degrees in certain
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to have a petition sign off in
every test.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it creates a tremendous amount of
infrastructure that does not respond in
[SPEAKER_03]: pandemic timescales.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, what's the difference between
being 17 0 2 5 and CLIA certified?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, enormous.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not even, I can get a 17 0 2 5 in
a weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's really easy to do ISO
17 0 2 5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not a weekend, but you know,
a week award.
[SPEAKER_03]: CLIA, your team could spend six months
getting all the books documented,
[SPEAKER_03]: your, your limb system proven,
your people signed off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, we had to go and get the college
transcripts for our staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the colleges were like,
this dude graduated 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have his fucking transcripts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had to request my diploma.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a PhD diploma.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, nobody's, nobody's on
campus right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: My whole university, but I'm like,
trying to dig up my diploma.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your transcripts, get your diploma,
get everything together.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know when you might need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Kevin, while we have you here,
you can, you give us like, sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: preview of what we can expect to see in
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think some COVID research will
make its way in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to pull in some of the folks
that were, I should, I should speak to the
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that were just here and see if
they're interested in presenting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try and hit them offline,
but we've reached out to a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that have published work on cannabis
and A and on QCertain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been some other work that's
going on with people demonstrating
[SPEAKER_03]: synthesis of these cannabinoids and cell
free systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is getting the enzymes to express
in full precursor without any cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: So still a synthetic biology approach,
but it's almost more like a PCR reaction
[SPEAKER_03]: that makes these things as opposed to
getting cells involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of excitement in the
field bringing, we're starting to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: genomics and the synthetic biology really
kick in and give us all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: tools to play with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing some work on detecting COVID
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just adapting what we do now to some
different targets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing some work studying its
longevity.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long does, if someone were to sneeze
on a plant, does it sit around?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it degrade in a day?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's RNA, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it there for weeks?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've also been doing more work
ourselves on, there's a Cannat
[SPEAKER_03]: Assemblathon we've going where some folks
at the Broad and Sergey Corrin who's built
[SPEAKER_03]: some assemblers and PacBio and a few
others are all throwing their newest tools
[SPEAKER_03]: at trying to reassemble the cannabis
genomes to make them better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to get the telomeres nailed
and the centromeres nailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that requires a lot more finishing
work, if you will, in the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of that's getting presented there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a panel out there on
Appalachians, which is kind of interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: The California Appalachian system is
starting to get some traction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one on sort of environmental
impacts of growing cannabis indoor and
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor, which has always been interesting
to me because I think the price
[SPEAKER_03]: differential is now almost 5X between
indoor and outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all this, putting it indoor in a
prison to grow it is really not a green
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're consuming shitloads of
probably coal fired energy to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis inside of a prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hoping some of the rules and
regulations over time will loosen up on
[SPEAKER_03]: THC grows that we don't have to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last I heard it was a couple percentage of
the entire energy grid in Colorado is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to cannabis lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that seems to be not a carbon friendly
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some of the carbon discussions
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's healthy, because when
you look at one of the synthetic biology,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got a plant right now that's a
carbon sink that grows 20% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got yeast, which are a
great model organism and a great tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're feeding those things sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sugar comes from chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 99% of the sugar in the world comes
from photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Calvin cycle and the yeast output
CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I haven't done all the
carbon credits on this thing, but there's
[SPEAKER_03]: an argument for some of these things
growing outdoors and being more effective
[SPEAKER_03]: than brewing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think some of the really interesting
cannabinoids that are coming through the
[SPEAKER_03]: yeast, because you can isolate a single
gene and understand the circuitry and get
[SPEAKER_03]: it to do what you want it to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's harder to do in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has like 90 different cannabinoids,
synthase genes, some that are extinct,
[SPEAKER_03]: some that are still partially functional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a more complex system to
manipulate than a yeast strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'm just, right now we've been
telling it's still on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pasadena Convention Center isn't going
to hold back.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to space people and have a
bigger auditorium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people don't feel like they've got to
sit right next to one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hotels are another manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to sort out the hotels,
some of the hotels.
[SPEAKER_03]: When exactly is it again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's end of September in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully enough time for this to blow
over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it'd be great to have the presenters
today at CanMed, because this is really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the intro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember reading the paper, but didn't
have any personal connection with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll try to reach out and see if they
have the time and the interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll put everyone on a group email.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the things, Jamaican lion,
I see it all the time in your kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like, what's the significance of Jamaican
lion like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just the first one you did something
with, and that's why you're talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: it all the time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it unique in some way?
[SPEAKER_04]: And where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have like Jeremy Menard as the
person I in my head know related to
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaican lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what was his role in all this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And Doug, look at that, Doug Kennedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how long my hair is, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: No haircut in three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to see mudflaps myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: See you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long time no see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in Malibu?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in Marina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's cloudy down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're getting clouds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you up in Malibu?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's sunny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely socked in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely socked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you heard, but I'm not
working with, but I'm helping Sean Penn
[SPEAKER_01]: and his COVID-19 testing sites around LA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin was saying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we should get in touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm working on some of the testing aspects
and aligning patterns.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually getting on the phone
right after I get off the gear with some
[SPEAKER_05]: testing companies that just got their UA's
that want to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's a way for us to work together,
it'd be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you and Sean doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sean responded to the mayor's plea for
help with the COVID-19 testing sites when
[SPEAKER_01]: he had the fire department leading them,
because the fire department was
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we took over the whole vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have eight sites in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seven in Chicago, a bunch in
Atlanta, a bunch in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nashville, we have them in New Mexico,
key spots where there's hotspots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Dorsey from Twitter gave Sean $10
million to finance staff to work on site
[SPEAKER_01]: to be there with the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're drive-through sites, so the
patient takes a test himself in the car
[SPEAKER_01]: and they drop it off on their way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing at Dodger Stadium,
we took that over two days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That site is seeing about 6,000 to 7,000
patients a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing is just to build data so
that way people in leadership can make
[SPEAKER_01]: good decisions off of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this PCR data or are you doing
antibodies?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is PCR data.
[SPEAKER_03]: PCR, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they want to go into antibodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I was in talks with Eurofins
Kevin just yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have antibody tests, COVID-19 testing
for people, for animals, for surfaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bunch of stuff, so they're wanting
to get involved in what Sean is doing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll soon have one for testing it
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how meaningful it's going to
be, but they are rarely finding this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: in cats and ferrets and dogs, so it's not
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're interested in finding it in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't be replicated in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone sneezes on it, that's the only
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or bat guano might get it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some bat guano fertilization going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what you're developing is a
test could be beneficial to Eurofins'
[SPEAKER_01]: desires to want to get involved that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it may.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an inhaled product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what people are worried about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's contaminated, got it on there
and then you inhaled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the patients are comorbid with the
same conditions that COVID seems to hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a remote lightning strike event.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more of an insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be ready with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the main problem we have with
COVID is when it hit the shore,
[SPEAKER_03]: no one was ready with the test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas they were in the other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then it took us 60 days to get all
the tests out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't want that 60 days to exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this ever gets found in cannabis,
we want it on the shelf, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people can deploy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kevin, you mentioned the bat guano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were those domestic bats?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that study was done like in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got no evidence of them being found
in US bat guano.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, these things, these cold
viruses, the news has kind of spun this as
[SPEAKER_03]: some scary novel virus that's never been
seen before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while the sequence is unique,
I don't think its immune epitote system is
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've seen enough antibody data
and enough number of people that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: on ships and have been on aircraft
carriers, where those studies show that
[SPEAKER_03]: like 82% of the people were clearly
exposed because they were contained in
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the tightest quarters you can
possibly hold people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't get the disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't pick up anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a cell paper off for you guys
that came out showing that prior
[SPEAKER_03]: coronaviruses, like HKU1 and a couple of
the other earlier coronaviruses,
[SPEAKER_03]: offer up CD4 and CD8 cells that are
responsive to SARS-CoV-2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the history of this thing is really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that it's been around before in a
different form and creating some
[SPEAKER_03]: antibodies in the population is probably
why the spread and the attenuation has
[SPEAKER_03]: been attenuated to some extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's going to be here again
next year, but probably in a different
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor and slightly mutated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have to adapt to whatever it is
that comes around next season.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is what we deal with with the flu
is every year you kind of have to refactor
[SPEAKER_03]: the vaccines.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flu mutates a little bit faster than
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's never a single target.
[SPEAKER_03]: You end up having to run epidemiological
studies every year to find out what this
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is turning into.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then retarget your energies at the
next seasonal version of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I would expect if you surveyed
enough stuff here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they're finding it bumping into
ferrets, into cats, into tigers,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going into pangolins.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found it in some dogs recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this thing just wants ACE2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really care what you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're a mammal, it seems like
it's going to grab hold and replicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't be surprised if we do find
it if it's surveyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just may not be SARS-CoV-2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be rat G13 or one of
the earlier ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means it was here longer,
maybe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, its earlier ancestors have probably
come through, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think SARS-CoV-2, the earliest evidence
we have is really in January.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, those dates keep getting moved
back as they find some earlier versions of
[SPEAKER_03]: them that hit shore the deeper they dig.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm even somewhat skeptical of the
December date in China being the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time it was ever in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the first time we had a
sequencer near someone who was sick in
[SPEAKER_03]: China that picked it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wouldn't be surprised if people had
it earlier and they just wrote it off as
[SPEAKER_03]: some other respiratory virus and off it
went and no one sequenced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you look at the epidemic,
if you look at the phylogenetic clocks on
[SPEAKER_03]: this, the gap between the bat,
which is called rat G13, and what we have
[SPEAKER_03]: circulating called SARS-CoV-2 is 40 to 70
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so there's a lot of information
from missing links that we don't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm under the assumption that they
exist, we just haven't sequenced them,
[SPEAKER_03]: because all things have ancestors unless
you make them in labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if this thing has natural
ancestors, which I think a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: penguin data shows it's likely natural
origin, then there's a lot of natural
[SPEAKER_03]: coronaviruses that have been out there
circulating that we haven't bothered to
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence because they probably were less
symptomatic than this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't register on the
epidemiology meters to go into pandemic
[SPEAKER_03]: scale and start sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's history, and that means
our immune system's probably seen parts of
[SPEAKER_03]: this before, and there's more immunity out
there than we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the antibody tests are
starting to show this, but the antibody
[SPEAKER_03]: tests, they're really specific to
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or the end
[SPEAKER_03]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be, they design those tests
with exclusion criteria so they don't hit
[SPEAKER_03]: MERS and they don't hit SARS, SARS-1.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting to track this
particular disease, but it may give us an
[SPEAKER_03]: underestimate of the people that are gonna
be affected by this.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a go back to work tool, it may be
conservative.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have people out there that are
immune to this because of their prior
[SPEAKER_03]: ancestral coronavirus exposure,
and we're never gonna see those with the
[SPEAKER_03]: current antibody tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it makes sense because some people are
asymptomatic then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those people that are
asymptomatic, there was another paper that
[SPEAKER_03]: came out saying a good number,
I think it was 33% of the people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even, initiate antibody production off of
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their innate immune system clears it
before they trigger an antibody response.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some people who just clear it
without even getting any memory for it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there are a lot of other, there are
asymptomatics that have antibodies,
[SPEAKER_03]: and let me get that cell paper and pop it
up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really interesting read,
but they demonstrated that there's some
[SPEAKER_03]: ancestral coronaviruses that are eliciting
at least CD4 and CD8 cells that are
[SPEAKER_03]: cross-responsive to SARS-CoV-2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Complicated space to fully test,
but the testing's needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Peter, I think you have that paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had sent it to you yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: The BioRivix one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have it on my fingertips here
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a nice read and sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, so Douglas, while we got you,
a question just occurred to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any plans to sort of upscale the
incredible testing you guys are doing to
[SPEAKER_02]: do then some tracing, which will be
necessary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that a next step in the- Yeah,
so we talked to the governor's office
[SPEAKER_01]: three times a week about tracing and other
stuff, and he wants to bring on 20,000
[SPEAKER_01]: people to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll definitely be involved in that
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, the COVID-19 test won't be so
needed as much as it is right now with our
[SPEAKER_01]: different sites that we have up,
so we'll condense our sites down,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll use our people that we have to
focus more on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If California asked for 20,000 people to
trace, they'd get 120,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or volunteering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have salaries, though, for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with Jack Dorsey's money and some other
money that's been coming through,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're able to fund people that are on the
ground at the sites and people that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be up and about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a team of volunteers that help
from home, like myself, that just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: help here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the staff, the people that are hired,
the staff are on full-time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were about to talk about Jamaican lion
and why it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why were we using that strain?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, we wanted a type two plant,
the plant that has both the CBD and the
[SPEAKER_03]: THC genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those loci are very different in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're usually like seven megabases
apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of the genomes that we had
done prior to that were either all type
[SPEAKER_03]: ones or all type threes, and we never had
a plant that made both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to make sure we had a
reference that included those.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some intellectual property
stuff that you guys have covered in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past that it may play a role in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the biotech LLC patents were
speaking toward type two plants like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's for lawyers to decide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gauged enough on that to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a type two plant that Jeremy
claims dated back prior to the filing of
[SPEAKER_03]: those things, but that's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what the audit trails are
and all that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the history of it, I actually picked
this up with Martin Lee.
[SPEAKER_03]: He brought me up to a Hopland dispensary
up in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I pulled down a few of those seeds and
years later decided to pop them and see
[SPEAKER_03]: what the hell they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lo and behold, they're type two
plants, interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's claimed it's powdery mildew
resistant, and I think we agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've not ever seen the plant get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to clarify, he being Jeremy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk about Jeremy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is he?
[SPEAKER_03]: I only met him after we published this,
and we identified that we picked it up out
[SPEAKER_03]: of Emerald Farms in Hopland.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people there were nice enough to
connect me to him, saying he's the one who
[SPEAKER_03]: provided us with the material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's where that kind of that
connection grew from.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's since given us a lot of data in terms
of how old it is and how long it dates
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually a two to one CBD to THC line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sometimes makes beta-carotene dominant,
sometimes mercy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not clear to us why and when.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the other complication there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does have a cannabichromine
cassette, which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a two megabase region in the plant
that a lot of other plants were noticing
[SPEAKER_03]: are missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't know that going in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that and sequenced another 40
genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw that, oh, God, this thing has a
region that a lot of these other ones are
[SPEAKER_03]: missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might be very important figuring
out residual THC levels and hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three genes that are predominantly
involved in cannabinoid synthesis that are
[SPEAKER_03]: on people's radar and have high sequence
similarity to one another are CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: synthase, THC synthase, and
cannabichromine synthase.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD synthase, if you put it in yeast,
will still make THCA, a little bit of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably a 20 to one ratio or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people are now growing CBG
plants because they don't even have that
[SPEAKER_03]: gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: The THC gene's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CBD gene's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just make the precursor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's even still some THC coming
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think that's coming through with the
cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not been proven yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems to line up with what we're
seeing genetically with a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did this to build a really nice
reference, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's now been used as a reference for
the urofin chips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Urofin's building a 90k SNP array with
this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're now in their earliest trials with
that chip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's chips in and they're running samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing a study on this with a
couple growers in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also providing them with a cross of
Jamaican lion to something that's powdery
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can try to track the resistance gene
when it's crossed into something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not resistant and see if we can track
those genes into other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put some of that in a preprint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll link up here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably several different ways
that the plants have evolved to become
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant to pathogens without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only looking at one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the mechanisms we're seeing in
Jamaican lion is a combination of a
[SPEAKER_03]: thometin-like protein and chitinase that
seems to be giving it its resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've cloned those genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've expressed them in a CoI.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've now spiked those expressed proteins
into aspergillus growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can demonstrate that those cannabis
proteins absolutely inhibit the growth of
[SPEAKER_03]: aspergillus in culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to clarify, if you put aspergillus
in a petri dish and you added this to it,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would not multiply exponentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: It slows its growth on a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing it now in liquid culture
to try and mimic what might happen with
[SPEAKER_03]: the foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll put maybe 20 aspergillus spores
in TSB and let it grow overnight with and
[SPEAKER_03]: without these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ones with the enzymes grow like
64-fold slower than the ones without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's doing something to slow the growth
of aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to repeat it on penicillium and
pusarium and a few others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the petri dishes are another way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just a little bit less
quantitative to measure than QPCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to take photographs and imagine
them not growing as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of digging into some of
those genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think you'll see, they had
asked earlier, Doug, some things to expect
[SPEAKER_03]: at CanMed this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I threw out a few things that I
remember but I figured you're a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: more intimate with that than I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll probably be sharing some of this
data on pathogen resistance in Jamaican
[SPEAKER_03]: lion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was mentioning that you guys had
some interesting panels, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: on environmental impact of growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a cultivation panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember correctly, wasn't there tissue
culture that you guys were hunting down?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few like that that we're
finalizing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess they're going up on the web in
about a week with a description for each
[SPEAKER_01]: one and who's presenting on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can send that information to all you
guys before then, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's coming along.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are finishing the abstract process now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're leaving room for people coming
in past the deadline that have stuff of
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're about 85% to 90% full on
our schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so you all know, the mayor's
office, I'm in touch with them all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's looking good for CanMed to happen
with the guidelines that the governor will
[SPEAKER_01]: put out for events like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to allow events of up to
2000 people starting right now as of
[SPEAKER_01]: mid-July, mid to end of July.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to have strict
guidelines in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Eurofins is interested in coming on,
Kevin, to present their different tests
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have to even for offices to use
to reopen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they want to test the convention
center before the conference starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure it's spick and span free of
virus.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe we'll throw them that test if
they have QPCR on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can check their cannabis if it's
got anything, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, on that, I'll let everyone go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, Kevin, I'd love to if you think it'd
be interesting to do like a Zoom
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation with you and Jeremy and other
people related to Jamaican Lion to have
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of a... I've never met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we might... That's why I think it'd be
kind of wacky and interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'd encourage that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try and get that going.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me stop the broadcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for jumping on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you.
See you next time.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
