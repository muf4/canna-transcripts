[SPEAKER_05]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little rise in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings and welcome to the townhouse
here in Venice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks to Budgasm over here for
bringing us all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Nick Atti of Essential
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joined by Phil Salazar of Soil Grown
Solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some other family over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks to everyone who's shown up and
come out, shown support and is here to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to you about the history of rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to provide a little education
and throw it back to some of the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been involved since day one that
have got us to where we're at today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Philip, did you want to say a little
something about yourself before we get
[SPEAKER_01]: started?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just here to talk about the history of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like where it's gone, where it started
and where we're pushing towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just stoked to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I'm going to break into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love giving credit where credit's due
and I'm extremely blessed to have been
[SPEAKER_01]: here from basically day one from when this
term was coined basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this started before Instagram
and before Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of underground forums and the
forums were where a lot of us growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: hash makers gained a lot of our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was this gentleman named
Confession, Compassion, C-O-M-P-H-A-S-O-N,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, or A-S-H-O-N.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is out there freely.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Chadwick Bostardo and I really
like to give credit to this gentleman
[SPEAKER_01]: because back in the day there were a few
forums that I was on along with this
[SPEAKER_01]: gentleman, Compassion, and he was really
the one who started using this term The
[SPEAKER_01]: term rosin has actually been around for
centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for a long time in the
adhesive and in that world, the adhesive
[SPEAKER_01]: world, just for a gummy substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instruments too like, you know,
violins, rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, rosin, that term has been around for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was brought into the cannabis
industry when Confession started utilizing
[SPEAKER_01]: a stainless steel bowl with a stainless
steel spoon, heating up that bowl,
[SPEAKER_01]: heating up that spoon, and literally
mechanically pressing his bubble hash into
[SPEAKER_01]: that bowl and stirring it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started noticing this ring of oil
on the outside of that bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he started pulling that ring of oil
with his dabber tool off of there and back
[SPEAKER_01]: then it was knife hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started taking that oil off and
taking knife hits and noticing that there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a lot less residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then the term full melt clear
dome, FMCD was a very popular term for
[SPEAKER_01]: when we got bubble hash or water hash so
good and so clean that it would bubble up
[SPEAKER_01]: and make these clear domes and basically
burn to very little, if not no residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until Chadwick, Compassion
actually started playing with this
[SPEAKER_01]: technology of utilizing hot stainless
steel instruments and mechanically
[SPEAKER_01]: separating the oils from the waxes that he
took this knife hit, saw these clear
[SPEAKER_01]: domes, and saw zero residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want to say that that's where
Rosin started.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that time there was no way to make
that technology commercialized or
[SPEAKER_01]: scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people in this industry talk
about how is it scalable?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you scale this technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where a lot of things are
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so back then it was the hash maker's
treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin started spreading that term.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is back, I want to say 2005,
maybe 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really bad with the actual date.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is pre-dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back then it was the hash maker that
got to keep that ring of oil for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin really wasn't able to get out to the
masses until people like this gentleman
[SPEAKER_01]: came along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want him to talk to you guys about
what really pushed Rosin to be scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the term that you came up with
and what were you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I called it like
sovereignless hash oil, SHO, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way it started, I was just really
into making hash and all my melts and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got to a point where I ran so
low on what I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any more of my harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got so low on my melts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was literally trying to smoke four star,
three and a half star, low quality melt
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to give thanks to you because I
remember seeing a tip on your page back
[SPEAKER_00]: then where I would take my low grade melts
and I'd put them between parchment and I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: use a hair straightener just to thin it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to get a better dab off low
quality hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got tired of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm trying to remember exactly,
but fast forwarding past flattening my
[SPEAKER_00]: hash out and just dabbing it like that,
getting to the point where I'm running out
[SPEAKER_00]: of my dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something went off in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember just thinking like,
OK, OK, going back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I messed up doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pressed it too hard in the hair
straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd see it would be real shiny on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dry in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't think anything of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd fold it up, do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd fold it up three times so it'd be nice
and homogenized, a nice good melt off of a
[SPEAKER_00]: low quality hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The best you'd get off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light bulb goes off in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that shininess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have a hair straightener
laying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the longest story possible of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't have a hair straightener
laying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually took a chunk of hash between
a piece of parchment and shoved it up
[SPEAKER_00]: against the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried not to burn myself or burn the
paper on the side of the coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, I pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was oil like I was hoping that
would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough to dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept doing it, doing it, doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me like five, 10 minutes just to
get one dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, my father-in-law,
family was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It melted to nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from there, that's where it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's where the rosin for me
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started by a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came back to me later on as an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was pressing hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all started with hash for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screen wasn't any part of it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was making low-quality rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still small contaminants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, it melted to
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ran out of all my hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just smoking bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, bing, light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, when I was pressing the
hash, my wife had come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she brought me a hair strainer because
I had been using her hair curler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she swapped that out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get back out of the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm at the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pressed a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 400 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super freaking hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pressed it on the parchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crazy amount of oil came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like three of us got a dab off of like a
little half gram bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were just amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just went nonstop from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nights of just pressing out eighths,
taking like five, six hours just to press
out eighths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an eighth on a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I think that's where all of
our light bulbs turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're like, that's where it's
scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is pressing flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because before we, as hash makers,
we didn't want to press the best quality
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got amazing quality hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to keep it as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have started playing with the
hair straightener to press it so that we
[SPEAKER_01]: could dab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we weren't anywhere in the mindset of
actually removing that waxy cuticle until
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like flower rosin came about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that term, I really want to give
credit to Phil over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's what changed game
for a lot of people, especially on the
[SPEAKER_01]: mass level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because kids all over the world had
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot harder for them to come by
amazing water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what changed game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time is when I really believe
we're pushing towards safe extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wanted to make oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all dabbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at a time when solventless was scarce
and when you'd get hash and it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: melt, it's just a disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to come by six star,
five star, even good hash to even know
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost my thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hash flip right before, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, going back to it, we came from
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to give you guys a
little recap right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came from somewhere where we were
watching forums of this guy named
[SPEAKER_01]: Confession taking bubble hash and pushing
it on some stainless steel bowl to then
[SPEAKER_01]: playing with hair straighteners to then
pressing flower itself into flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, look where we've come.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been so many different advances in
technology since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man helped put out one of the very
first rosin presses on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been so many other rosin
presses since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the technology just keeps changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's thanks to the education
that we started, the open forum education
[SPEAKER_01]: style that Confession was pushing it on
originally, that we've continued that
[SPEAKER_01]: trend of really pushing education to our
peers, to our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just continues to evolve into
something that I had never even imagined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up making bubble hash in my uncle's
barn in a hot barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're actually separating THC or
THCA on a scientific level, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing 99.9% THCA without the use of
any chemical solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, really, really come a long
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up everyone that's involved in that
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, big ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about where it's going now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you guys familiar with some of the
new consistencies that we're seeing out
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Show of hands out there in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you guys have tried rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we first started making rosin was
really when the consistency of earwax was
[SPEAKER_01]: popular in the BHO world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to bring it back to 2008,
2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: And BHO had really just hit the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: BHO was called earwax back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as hash makers started to make water
hash on a more controlled level,
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher level, we wanted to mimic what
was happening in the BHO world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is pre-rosin, but we started
making hash on a higher level where the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash was coming out gold rather than
brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was coming out smelling really like
the flower that it was come from because
[SPEAKER_01]: we were controlling the variables of the
water, the temperature of the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: our environment that we were making the
hash in, and that starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started really, really paying attention
to the starting material rather than using
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff at uncle's farm that had been
sitting on the side of the road that he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want on his property because that
was more weight on his property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we were making bubble hash out
of initially up in Mendocino, Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started making bubble hash out of close
trim and not just the close trim mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the fan leaf and everything else
they were throwing away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we started making water hash out of
fresh frozen material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 2008, 2009 was when I first did my
first wash with fresh frozen material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, we're making water hash
with whole plant fresh frozen material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, we're going to talk about some
of the amazing magicians in the crowd over
[SPEAKER_01]: here that can make fire with dry trim
that's been sitting around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, the pinnacle of water hash
is using whole plant fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jumping around a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But throw it back to that 2008,
2009 generation when earwax was popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start learning a little bit more and
then shatter becomes extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2009, Colorado, California, 2010,
and shatter is the consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started wanting to recreate that
consistency of shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started heating it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started heating up our hair
straighteners a little bit hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, pressing in between parchment
paper, just our water hash at a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature to create more stability,
more of a clear see-through shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's another one of the
variables that pushed us as hash makers to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out what rosin was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted more stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to create these
consistencies we were seeing in the BHO
[SPEAKER_01]: world, but we weren't seeing as much
stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just press hash at 200,
250 degrees, you're going to see it turn
[SPEAKER_01]: into shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, you're going to see it
start to degrade, turn darker,
[SPEAKER_01]: butter up some of those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until rosin came along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rosin, the actual art of rosin,
is removing the rest of that waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at cannabis, cannabis is a
plant that has a lot of these shiny
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes on the outside, the crystals,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plants have different structures of
these crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as hash makers, and specifically rosin
makers, we're learning about this
[SPEAKER_01]: structure even more with every strain that
we run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains have that longer stalk with a
very small head, with a thick waxy
[SPEAKER_01]: cuticle, and they may not run as well in
water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not press as well in rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start seeing some strains that have a
thick stalk and a really bulbous head with
[SPEAKER_01]: a thin waxy cuticle, and you're seeing
them run better in water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing the waxy cuticle affect the
rosin less, and you're seeing higher
[SPEAKER_01]: yields, higher potencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so moving forward, we started seeing
these different consistencies,
[SPEAKER_01]: like shatter, like the earwax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we move, we started seeing
this sauce consistency in the butane
[SPEAKER_01]: world, where we were seeing a layer of
terpenes on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pushed us rosin makers to
continue this movement and to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to create a higher echelon for our
industry by pushing education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've taught each other at
this point that we can now separate THCA
[SPEAKER_01]: via different temperatures and different
pressures to pull those terpenes and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: the THCA, separate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now as we see these saucy and jammy
consistencies in the BHO world,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been playing with pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like butane hash oil is utilizing
these columns, basically, to pull pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: and then keep the butane and the trichomes
under pressure, creating separation,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're now seeing the same thing in the
solventless world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are calling it rosin jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are calling it solventless sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing these consistencies now
via solventless means and rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rosin history just continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we see different consistencies,
as we see, I feel like as we see now
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbon guys starting to separate
delta 9 and CBG and THCV, that's all with
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure and columns and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think as we continue that might
be some of what we see in the future as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as what rosin can really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a column.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need heavy chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to possibly blow up your
neighbor's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing all of these different
consistencies via solventless means thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: to rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the use of heat, pressure,
and force, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that really kind of concludes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any questions from the audience
or anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody think that rosin is going in
another direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody disagree with what we talked about
as far as the history of rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far we've come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, this started what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's on the commercial market
heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just actually came from Cookies in
Maywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a ton of different rosin
brands on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd say, realistically, it took off
about five years ago when the masses
[SPEAKER_00]: started to learn and do it themselves at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more minds that are able to focus
and work on it and share the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: that they find, I think that's why we've
quickly evolved this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to Hashell, it's been around
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's taken so long to get to where it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the butane extraction and with
everybody hands on trying to learn new
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and do the next best thing with
solventless or with rosin, I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're breaking through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find all these different
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be able to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already at the point where we're
separating THC and fats and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty crazy to see some of the
hydrocarbon companies switching over to
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I feel like that's when we
made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This education really did something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the guys that have been known for
making butane, making solventless now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of January 1, 2019, a lot of the new
regulations came into California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very difficult to just set up a
closed loop system, get the fire
[SPEAKER_01]: department out there, go through all those
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were able to get to the end goal of
a concentrate and a nice, healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative right when regulations hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the first companies to come to
shelf were rosin companies or solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: companies because it was a little bit
easier to get manufacturing going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Licensing for type 6 via type 7 was a
little bit easier to push through because
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't have to deal with the fire
department nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of factors have really,
really changed game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like when we started putting
solventless products or water hash
[SPEAKER_01]: products on the shelves in Colorado back
in 2009, we were maybe 1% to 3% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate market was water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, I think we're
definitely pushing 20% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates, especially in places like
California and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big up yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate all the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep pushing education, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what puts the products on the
shelves that are healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what puts the quality on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what helps the consumer
understand what's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Quick question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talked about innovations in
solventless.
[SPEAKER_05]: As solventless guys, talk about
innovations you've seen in the solvent
[SPEAKER_05]: world where you've been like, oh,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, the perfect example is the
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of touched on it, but I'll back it
up a little bit just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody didn't catch that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the hydrocarbon world, right when
we learned about rosin, a year or two into
[SPEAKER_01]: learning really about commercializing and
scaling up the creation of rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: we started seeing the butane guys make
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were like, uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to step up our game over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on shatter right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're starting to make this butter and
these lighter consistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But diamonds, uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make this in the lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we compete?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, it was all in playing with
different temperatures, different
[SPEAKER_01]: pressures, different separations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the first diamonds were not
actually grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now seeing, on the solvent side of
things, growing diamonds with pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first diamonds to come to the
industry were actually mechanically
[SPEAKER_01]: separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amorphous solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amorphous solid crystalline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to bring it up a little
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have touched on the gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to big up a man named Jeff or
the cannabis reverend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Church, cannabis reverend,
was one of the first gentlemen to bring in
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual micron screen to separate the
oils from the waxes or what we later found
[SPEAKER_01]: out to be a lot of that THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that bag not only contained a lot of
the waxes, but it also contained a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually, we learned that pressing at
higher temperatures would completely
[SPEAKER_01]: remove the rest of the terpenes and
actually a lot of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at those higher temperatures,
we were just retaining THCA, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, we learned that that white
powdery substance was the THCA that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were seeing some of these hydrocarbon
companies put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started testing some of those,
that white powdery substance, and hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere from 94% to 99% THCA in our
regulated licensed labs in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were like, whoa, how do we
turn this white powder into what looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like the diamonds?
[SPEAKER_01]: More heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we brought the temperature right back
up to around 250 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do it at different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, to melt that white powder
back down into a solid form, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: can mold that form into whatever shape you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we first started doing it,
we were just making very, very thick
[SPEAKER_01]: slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started with the white powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heated it up into these thicker slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were smashing it in the lab and in
our parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was basically just making it making
all different shapes and sizes of crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started getting that tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with that slight temperature up
crease, upwards of 250 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were not seeing any THCA turn into THC,
which was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our labs were telling us that it was
pure 99.9% THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, some of the labs that we were
using, not to put anybody on blast,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some of the labs that we were using
were giving us test results back at
[SPEAKER_01]: 108.4%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to step back and say,
OK, we can't put this on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have over 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we contacted the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, we've never seen
anything that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started looking at the standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be an ongoing issue
in newly regulated environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the standards came from
ResTech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another standard that's put
out by another company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few more companies that are
putting out cannabis standards now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ResTech's standards range from like
97% to 98.9%, their THCA standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we turned in our THCA sample,
it was higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we bumped the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like they have to create some
new standards at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we started leveling it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab started learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were mechanically separating THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get back to the original question,
mimicking these hydrocarbon guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: it started with the earwax.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created solventless wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the rosin has really, really given us
the advantage to recreate different
[SPEAKER_01]: consistencies we're seeing in the
hydrocarbon world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw diamonds become instantly popular
with butane extraction and propane
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, a few other methods to create
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had to find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we utilized heat pressure and
mechanical separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much A did you throw away before you
figured out that it was THCA?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the craziest thing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, luckily, we were actually using a
lot of it in other products, topicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles, and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things of that nature because we were
seeing the test results in our coconut oil
[SPEAKER_01]: and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just didn't put two and two
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy to think back on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we definitely threw a lot away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely used some for purposes that
we shouldn't have been using it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: In mechanical separation, I always like to
talk about allocations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is maybe something we can take a
little break on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But allocations are extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of those allocations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were throwing away something that had a
lot of value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another allocation I talk about is,
especially when we're talking about butane
[SPEAKER_01]: versus solventless, I use the strain Blue
Dream for the perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a full indoor operation of Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring it into your lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got the hydrocarbon guys next
door, butane extraction guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're yielding 18% to 24% on this
Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring that same exact Blue Dream into
the water hash lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might be yielding 3% to 5% on that Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And originally, I just started this
discussion about the trichome structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it has a thick, waxy cuticle or a
longer trichome stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Blue Dream is one of those ones that
has a long stock, a very small head,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a thick, waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not yield well in water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find the very specific cut that
does do well in water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for general purposes, a lot of times
the Blue Dream that we see is just not
[SPEAKER_01]: good for allocating towards water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the same thing goes with
allocations on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that that white powdery substance
that we were taking away in our bags and
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping the clean, clear, beautiful gold
raws in, we were throwing that away,
[SPEAKER_01]: as Phil mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've now learned to allocate that and
utilize that THCA that we're throwing
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got lit up here, so I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we're used to the full
spectrum, like 45 to 160.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys played with the 160 plus for
separation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've found some good heads in the
160s and bigger heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys tried exploring that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying, do we basically isolate
the 160, 180 micron and press that out and
[SPEAKER_00]: see the quality of that rosin and do stuff
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just recently, it was some indoor,
but it was isolated 180 micron from an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, to me, not a common thing to
find for ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 180U, and it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually put out about 91% return on
the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the most impressive 180 I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he talks about that return on the
rosin, he's talking about the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome head being pressed into rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're talking about a 91%
return, that means there's barely any waxy
[SPEAKER_01]: cuticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you're barely losing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start with five grams and you're
yielding, what, 4.2, 4.5, or 4.6 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm horrible with math.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with the gram and you're getting
0.91 back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, for the most part,
a lot of strains, I like the 180,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really depends on your methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gentle agitation, depending on strains and
knowing what you're working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment you're working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And controlling all your variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the 180 and the 150 are really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for the most part, I usually
isolate everything, depending on what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find in the end, a lot of things end
up just making it into the same batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I'll do is I'll isolate and
then I'll press everything out and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: separate everything by quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not quality just by color, but quality
by terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have to dab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste, I noticed the 40, the 40 micron is
usually not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep that little separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't know if it's more fats and
lipids that are in it that's giving it a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's still great oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, I think keeping the 40
separated is better than keeping the 180
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 150 separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, the 180 and the 150 have a
high terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, those have my favorite terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can ever catch a 150 or a 180,
those are just, man, lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to really summarize that, it's so
strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually speaking of your OG Kush
that yielded amazing in your 180 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran some lemon Kush, Himalayan lemon
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a strain that was brought back by a
soldier friend of ours that we ran in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one round that one of my growers
grew, we yielded over two ounces of full
[SPEAKER_01]: melt in the 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to go back on what Phil said,
I really like to emphasize that we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We separate all of the microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a couple 220 bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually run a couple there and in the
washing machine just to make sure we've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten all that plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then run a 185, a 160, a 120,
sometimes the 100, the 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes to run a strain that we've never
ran before, I'll put all my bags in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try and separate as many as I can
because each strain, each grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: each medium is going to be a little
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even from one row, you might be running
the same strain in a grow house but have
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs in one row, have your HPS in another.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even there's differences from the top of
your plant to the bottom of the plant as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as the trichome formation,
the amount of oils in them, the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really like to, especially when
we're running a strain that we haven't run
[SPEAKER_01]: before, is run all of those different
micron sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can combine them in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't combine them if you've started
with only three microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't separate them, sorry,
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like to start out with as many bags
as we can, see where the heads are lying,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then eventually on that next run when
you're running that same material from
[SPEAKER_01]: that same garden, you can remove some
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use all those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think right there,
I think what that is, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: is every strain has a different head and
tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the head's the cream and the
tail's going to be your butt end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be its lower quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, when you see the
head and tail together, like a full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum hash oil or something,
it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you actually pull that tail end
out of, let's just say, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: a headband we're running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run seven, eight spins,
30 minute spins, and you're still pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five spins in, it was just quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it's getting darker,
more contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get to the rosin,
and you're pressing everything out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything's just coming out gold,
regardless of the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got 100 grams of high quality
and 10 grams of just some darker oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other strains, you'll notice, regardless
of the yield, you might have got the same
[SPEAKER_00]: yield off that strain as far as hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to pressing,
you have more wax membrane to those heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, you're getting more tail end
with that head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at, let's just say you
get 80 grams and 30 grams of tail end,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the darker oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more when you're looking for
when people are separating their rosins,
[SPEAKER_00]: having their head stash and then just the
edible grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I'm more of a full spec guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep the tail end out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an important part of
extraction, is the head and tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of what we're doing,
rosin, ice water extraction, a head and
[SPEAKER_00]: tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about knowing when to pull and
what to keep separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amateur grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anybody here ever explored what
ultrasonic cleaning for washing hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, literally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we've, yeah, the question is,
has anybody utilized ultrasonic cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: with hash or ultrasonic technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've used it on actually a number of
scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, companies that I know right
now are utilizing that technology in a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of ways as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll touch on a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a company come into our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were one of the first licensed
facility, blessed to be one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed facility in the world,
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of companies from the cold
brew industry, from the wine industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: beer industry, started contacting us
because we were able to do license
[SPEAKER_01]: protected R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an ultrasonic agitation company or
cavitation company, similar technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: contacted us from the cold brew industry
and brought in machines and machinery into
[SPEAKER_01]: our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started playing around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, cannabis is a lot different
than coffee and hops, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just kept having clogging issues
with that machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I saw value in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did utilize that cavitation or
that ultrasonic technology, not to
[SPEAKER_01]: separate the heads from the material like
we initially wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still do think that there is value
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there is viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead, we ended up, because it costs
so much money for the machinery and to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep making these diodes bigger and these
passageways bigger because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: had to flow, but we wanted to get an exact
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of variables that cost a
lot, millions of dollars, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: in R&D that this cavitation company didn't
want to just keep shelling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we ended up finding out that on a very
high level, turning up that cavitation
[SPEAKER_01]: device, that ultrasonic device,
we were able to actually fully homogenize
[SPEAKER_01]: the oil into the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for edible products, for topical
products, there's a lot of value in
[SPEAKER_01]: ultrasonic agitation and cavitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do think there is value in
separating the oil via this technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys aren't familiar, basically,
ultrasonic agitation is a wave that is so
[SPEAKER_01]: intense that it can actually separate oil
from water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've used it in actually separating
rivers and things of that nature on a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger scale, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: cavitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we saw this value because we started
turning it up and actually breaking the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome heads in water, which would be
our solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have oil and water in one
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started going back to, okay,
how do they get oil out of water?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started playing with some of the
technology that they're using in the
[SPEAKER_01]: oceans to get spills out of the oceans.
[SPEAKER_01]: These polymer tubes, basically,
that run on the bottom of the ocean that
[SPEAKER_01]: are pulling the oil out of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we played with that, but we weren't
seeing the yields we wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do think that there's a lot to do
there, and there is a future for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get there yet myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think one of y'all could.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one of Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Boeing model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing with it, and I've been
getting some amazing results myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share it with everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it up on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw it up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tag these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's about, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found each other somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found compassion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of us found compassion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep spreading knowledge, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stick around today, because I think we
definitely have some more discussions,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little round table with a few more hash
makers in the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to take a little split
break, I think, right about now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that on?
Yes, it is.
