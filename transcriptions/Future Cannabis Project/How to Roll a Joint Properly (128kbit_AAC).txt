[SPEAKER_00]: I've rolled a few joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've rolled many joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never rolled a joint on board the
Queen Mary before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami, you're a legend of cannabis
cultivation, but you've also got a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific joint rolling technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you can share it with us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's called a Swami joint that we
roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first of all, I never started to be
giving a seminar on rolling a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, you need a certain number of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, a rolling tray is nice,
and a nice piece of wood is very good,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you keep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I like to use a grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like scissors or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with really good flour, you need
something to really break it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because actually, the quality of the grind
is also very much part of the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: the joint you roll, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a special tamper that I
use to tamp the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my traveling tamper, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone doesn't lift this one off,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a golf pencil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the lighter and papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the papers I do want to put in a plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elements papers, as far as I'm concerned,
are far and away the best papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just beautiful papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hardly leave any ash, and they're
also very easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the first thing you want to do is
pick your flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I would always suggest
Swami's flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that lever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these jars are special Ultraviolet
jars that only let ultraviolet light in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it preserves your cannabis in a much
better way than everyone else,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course, you have your tube to
carry once you've got the pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to break this up into
little, little pieces to go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will take a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I've found is people
kind of lose patience watching me roll a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint, because if you're not being careful
If you really, you're not rolling a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're crafting a smoking experience,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the whole thing about the smoking
experience, we were talking about earlier,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: About how the joint is the most efficient
way to deliver everything that the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, so say for imagine for a moment
that this is your joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later, and the top of it now has a
cinder, which is combusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, it's actually,
you're getting at room temperature what
[SPEAKER_01]: you just, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the combustion goes down,
what's back here on your mouthpiece is
[SPEAKER_01]: rising up one degree at a time,
one degree at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every different cannabinoid vaporizes
at a different temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you smoke a joint, you start from
room temperature, and eventually you get
[SPEAKER_01]: the combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything in between is delivered to
you by smoking from a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's the only actual method
that really does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because vaporizer has got one or two
temperature ranges only, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a bowl, you're flashing it with your
light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you hit it with that lighter and it
all goes up at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with a joint, you get cannabis that's
off gassing at room temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then all the way on a continuous scale
up to combustion, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's also like, there's a
ritual to it that should be embraced.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now we're getting the
philosophy of things on a deeper level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I think about cannabis is
that one of the things that cannabis does
[SPEAKER_01]: is stimulate all your sensory perceptions,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Heighten them and make them deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rolling a joint itself is really
celebrating the cannabis because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the tactile, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the olfactory, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you actually smoke it,
that's called the gustatory, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also get the sound, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the joint, and to clean it out,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The grinder, to clean it out, you have to
clap it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's like telling everybody in
the room that you're in the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that'll bring people in from the
hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it the Mendocino mating call.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's to clean up the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the whole idea now is you want to
get a good grind, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're making coffee, the best way
to do it is grind it just before and get
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the grind you want for whether
you're using a filter or a French
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, for cannabis, the grind is
perhaps one of the most important things
[SPEAKER_01]: about the quality of the smoke that you're
gonna get with your joint, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to hurry up here because
this takes, we're manufacturing a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're crafting a joint here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing about the joint is
that the paper to cannabis ratio wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: be favorable to cannabis, so exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the New York Pinner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can pick your teeth with a New
York joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking paper, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's not a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say, however, that to really be
able to grow a Swami joint, you almost
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be a grower because they're gonna
be almost an eighth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be a pretty expensive joint,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we always share.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the thing we always share with
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it gets passed around and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: See there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're getting the, you want to
smell that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's loving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which one is that that I did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that's what we call Pine Angel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's a cross of in the pines
with, I think it's a Durban in there too,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pine Angel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the consistency you're looking
for on the grind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, since every kind of,
every cultivar, as we're saying these
[SPEAKER_01]: days, not strain every cultivar of
cannabis, has its own kind of textural
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also how is it cured?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too damp?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so each one is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes if it's really kind of
sticky and lumpy, I'll grind it twice to
[SPEAKER_01]: really get that proper texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as I said before, it's a smoking
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just you're getting high,
you're getting, no, you're engaging all
[SPEAKER_01]: your senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you do finally smoke,
it's really, you know, you want to really
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it like a cigar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever smoke cigars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly I cut them open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that coffee analogy is a really
good one, too, because if you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-ground coffee, it just cannot be of
the same quality as grinding it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much is released in the first 30
seconds of the grinding.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have a rule when I make coffee is
that I don't allow more than 30 seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 45 seconds between grinding and
pouring the water over it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all those volatile organic
compounds again, which are vaporizing out,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, if you want to get a really
good sense of the aroma of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that moment after you grind it is the best
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually sometimes not always the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cup we found, I'll break open a bud
and I'll get a really really wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but then when I grind it somehow it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is unique in cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, yeah, it's always so unique
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the little tricks about rolling
with the paper is, I don't know if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see that, but you don't roll it square.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about the line that they fold and
make your own fold slightly on an angle
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a little taper close to the
mouthpiece, right, and it kind of holds it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little, what do they call those
trade secret kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secret sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secret sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, another thing now about terpenes,
you were exclaiming about the terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: with the flowers here, and I was reading,
a long time ago I was reading one of Ed
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosenthal's books, and he's got a little
graph there that shows the peak of terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this graph it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just before dawn, just before first
light, terpene saturation is maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at its least at sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at a certain point I said, okay,
let's harvest in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I harvest the cannabis,
and I found out that's what wine people do
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You harvest your grapes, because that's
maximum sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually people going to farmer's
market, they're gonna harvest their
[SPEAKER_01]: lettuce early in the morning, because
that's when everything at its peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started harvesting my cannabis
in the dark in the morning, my terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile just went right through the roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well not through the roof, in the,
wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that's a, oh, this is a
little sticky, this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, there's two kinds of sticky also.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sticky because it's not dry
enough, that's gonna, you'll find some now
[SPEAKER_01]: in November, October, and then there's
sticky that, this is a year old,
[SPEAKER_01]: this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's been in those jars,
right, it's still got that terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: saturation and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I gotta drink a water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now people think you're
finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, you're not finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you, now you've created your
tube or your cylinder, which you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: proceed to stuff full.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there's all this stuff left on
the tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm a sloppy roller too,
I'm spilling all over, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have complained, they see when
they say, how come this got dirty
[SPEAKER_01]: fingernails, Swami?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're, because I'm a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't had my hands in the dirt for
a few days, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this is what you do carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tamp it in and then you squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what's great about these
elements papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they're dry, you can really
mistreat them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm squeezing it down to get all the
air bubbles out and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it from the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is gonna take a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I'll do it from this end,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, now this is what gets kind of
tedious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just putting this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else do you wanna talk about while
we're doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how was this year on the farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this year our plants are gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really, I've got, with the county,
they're allowing us to do a few more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a few more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm slowly expanding, which is difficult
to scale up without growing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we've got our plants and they're
really gorgeous and green and big and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're starting to put out those
fragrances and aromas that sort of just
[SPEAKER_01]: bring you into the garden from a long way
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking forward to a good
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also looking forward to the
Emerald Cup, which is happening this year
[SPEAKER_01]: in kind of a new context with the new
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working out a lot of the details
for that, but Nikki and I are still be
[SPEAKER_01]: judging the flowers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody wants to enter the Emerald Cup,
please do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems like a peak joint rolling
opportunity, the judging the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, we see what I would do for the
Emerald Cup is they give us a gram in an
[SPEAKER_01]: unmarked jar, just a number on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a totally blind contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only one that's really blind like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a couple of weeks to test
it usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we tested on the look and the
fragrance, aroma, and the flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then finally the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effects get double the points,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the look is 10 points maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fragrance 10 points maximum and the
flavor 10 point maximum when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the effects gets 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the results of that kind of
scoring is that the winner of the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Cup has never had the highest THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the experience of looking at it
and smelling it and so on, something
[SPEAKER_01]: scores really high on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking at the total
experience of the cannabis as a smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: event for the flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it roll up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it really dusty on the tray or
something like that after you grind it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it super sticky because it's not
quite dry yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the contest is in December and
maybe they harvested in November,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those little things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be perfectly honest, we don't
actually smoke all the entries because not
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them are worth smoking,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shaggy trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really scruffy or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can't be a winning bud in the display
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no smell, no terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it kind of missed something,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even smoke those two,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll get one, oh, the terpenes are
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like a nice bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some crystal on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trichomes are kind of golden amber and
all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those little signs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you roll it up and then you smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden I'll look at
Nikki and I'll say, you want another hit
[SPEAKER_01]: of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll say, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you take two hits off this thing
and you say, okay, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get one that's really,
really, really good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say, you want some?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the really good ones, you smoke all
the way down to the bottom because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes where the best hit is because
it's kind of accumulation, summation of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's come before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now see, we're almost there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost got, it's got a little bit
more at the bottom, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still, it's a pretty solid joint
and see, it's got that taper a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the other thing is you'll notice I
didn't put a filter in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's a lot of people consider filter
necessary, kind of a courtesy or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the little bits of, you know,
cannabis can get in your mouth or what
[SPEAKER_01]: have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that can be an issue for
people, but in years at the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: I found I can taste the cardboard in the
filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm trying to judge someone's
cannabis purely for that, it's not fair to
[SPEAKER_01]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I never use a filter
cause I can, I can taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the, you know, the one bleach filters
and so on, even the white ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can taste the bleach actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I have a, I have a roach
clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I like to do at the end of
the joint is to put it on to the roach
[SPEAKER_01]: clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know about these, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little alligator clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a boa feather on the end of it
if you want or, you know, anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have to tell you a little story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I had originally, I shouldn't tell
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the roach clip makes it easy
to pass and the joint doesn't fall apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, yeah, I am gonna tell that
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years and years ago, I had a roach clip
like this, and I had a gold chain attached
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the end of it, I put my Phi Beta
Kappa Key.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what a Phi Beta Kappa Key is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you get, it's an award you get when
you graduate from college, cause you had,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, straight A's or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I have this roach clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hippie in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a certain point, somebody steals
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just had to let it go, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was sort of something like,
well, not just stoners, not just whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, I got a Phi Beta Kappa Key
here and I'm using it to pass you a roach
[SPEAKER_01]: and let's share this and let's,
let's get down to it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's a, did I have to tell
the story?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say, it'll be on the DVD extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just about done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently because of various other
situations, we're not allowed to smoke it
[SPEAKER_01]: in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's still a stigma to
cannabis and the smell and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, people don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to honor that and so on,
but we can go outside and smoke this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there anything else we need to tell
people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is your Swami joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's only one thing left to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You read my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to the starboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
