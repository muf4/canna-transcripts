[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm really interested in what you
think about the elevation of both chemovar
[SPEAKER_00]: and phenotype in the cannabis plant
through earth conscious, through
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology conscious, through
environmental conscious, environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing as well, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think that that intertwines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing a real dichotomy in the
cannabis industry between what I'll call
[SPEAKER_01]: factory production of cannabis and I've
seen some very sophisticated operations
[SPEAKER_01]: all under LED lights, artificial media,
and there's a uniform product that results
[SPEAKER_01]: but whether this is really something
that's going to be truly therapeutic is an
[SPEAKER_01]: open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere in the middle I've seen indoor
operations with all organic media and
[SPEAKER_01]: their real effort to create a biological
foundation for healthy plants and it shows
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of what the plants look like,
their trichome density and all those good
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side is regenerative
agriculture which philosophically and
[SPEAKER_01]: conceptually really appeals to me as
trying to maximize the potential of what
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, there again, there are different
considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fond of saying that if you want to
produce good terpenoids like in lavender,
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually need an environment like in
Provence and France.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a very poor rocky soil and it's
actually that stress to the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: causes it to produce more of these
protective materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it possible, question is,
for a plant to be too happy and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to produce as much of these
materials because it's getting everything
[SPEAKER_01]: it does need from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in the flip question, is it producing
all of it because you're giving it an
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate nutrient?
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen so far the answer is
the latter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a situation where a plant that's
in a rich soil and has the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae there has the ability to
uptake anything it needs and under those
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions you're definitely going to have
a happy plant and my suspicion is you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have the most therapeutic kind of
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be helpful at this point to have
a few more scientific studies that either
[SPEAKER_01]: confirm or refute this kind of concept but
it is a question we can easily answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I think it's pretty amazing that I
think that we're noticing now from
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding maybe like the same varietal for
12, 13 years and just you know not keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: a mother for that whole time but you know
picking out varietals each year for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production that visually look like that
olifactory look like that are growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way and that's the way that we do our
breeding so you know it's not so
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific although we have done you know
labs and different tests we haven't done
[SPEAKER_00]: it in particular of what we're seeing with
varietals starting to raise their CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG especially so we'll get something
maybe even a one point whatever and have
[SPEAKER_00]: that varietal for a long time the CBG
levels are really skyrocketing the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I notice is that and I want to
ask you this next is that the THC goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down and other cannabinoids raise up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well certainly I think that's a good thing
somebody who believes in the entourage and
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits of these other components it
shouldn't all be about THC that is in
[SPEAKER_01]: contrast the aim of production and most of
the factors
[SPEAKER_01]: that we hear from doctors that are using
diversified material is they're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: better results that it's working better
for a variety of conditions also better
[SPEAKER_01]: toleration by the patients you know it
shouldn't be all about getting a high THC
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right so do you think that like if you're
milking heavily one cannabinoid then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a ratio thing that other
cannabinoids will go down to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it doesn't need to be we're seeing
some more balanced normally you've got one
[SPEAKER_01]: that's predominant maybe another one that
could have close to the same amount or
[SPEAKER_01]: more often a lower amount but we're also
seeing some very balanced ones where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're actually reasonable amounts of
four different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the maximum amount of
percentage like if you had to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all these different lab tests
everybody's got a percentage there's only
[SPEAKER_00]: a max amount of weight that can be in a
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's absolutely true I don't
believe anything above 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 is a logical upper limit and that would
be from a top bud that's well manicured
[SPEAKER_01]: where everything has been done to maximize
that number but that'd be a total so it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a reciprocal relationship you could have
25% THC but you can't have 25% THC and 12%
[SPEAKER_01]: of CBD you know a trichome is only a
certain percentage of the mass of a flower
[SPEAKER_01]: so there are limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah I'm very interested in seeing
these balanced chemovars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again in contrast there is a tendency the
approach at GW Pharmaceuticals was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely specific cannabinoids in the
highest concentrations and then if
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary could use that to blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativex is in fact a combination of a high
THC and a high CBD chemovar so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: another way to do it a blended medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally it's nice if you get what you need
from one plant but that is going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of selective breeding and a lot of
experimentation with patients to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what about the idea that you know
not only are deep soil beds and really
[SPEAKER_00]: rich microbiology environments that are
heavy in fungi and a continuous feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle good for cannabis this we know and
we need to be studying it we need to you
[SPEAKER_00]: know really put it to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely so there are two issues here
one is what's best for the plant and its
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic potential the other is what's
best for the earth and the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: that's no contest we're already know
people should be doing this because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most ecologically relevant and
helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that you can have a rich soil you
haven't added any nitrogen there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be any runoff that's getting into
the water table producing algae blooms
[SPEAKER_01]: downstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is critical because you know things
are changing we're going to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: increasingly harsh environment on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be doing everything we can to
mitigate the harms and regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture is absolutely one of the top
priorities in that effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and we're really noticing that as
cannabis farmers right now because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting pathogens on our plants that we've
never had before in amounts that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: never had before of course that definitely
has to do with the trade of this plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to make clones and then you're
passing on the pathogens with the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're even passing on you know
pathogens of chemicals and long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic things but what I wanted to get
to is not only are we noticing that deep
[SPEAKER_00]: rich soils are good for the cannabis plant
but because of these pathogens and our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment being so pressing and so toxic
we're also noticing that the plant does
[SPEAKER_00]: best in a multi you know faceted garden
beds with many different varietals in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that are feeding pollinators and I'm
wondering about now the idea that it just
[SPEAKER_00]: only seems natural to me and to a lot of
other cannabis farmers and growers about
[SPEAKER_00]: compounding this medicine with other herbs
and utilizing you know the grand spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: of herbs on this planet to help with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about compounding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it's something in which I think there's
great promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that hasn't really been
accepted very well yet by the supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: industry but that could change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean they have to be considering the
competitive advantage they would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually surprised that some of the
bigger companies haven't come out with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol lines at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've explored this with some of the
companies and said basically if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in doing this I'd love to be
involved but nobody's taken the bait so
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trouble is again governments sorting out
the regulations and this kind of thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a morass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientifically it shouldn't be difficult
legislating it's extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music .
