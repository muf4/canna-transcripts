[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this since 1986.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to me about strains from the past
that you can't find anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golf ball indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original Mendo Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golf ball indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw it coming out of Mendocino,
Ukiah, that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It disappeared in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The camp raids were more effective than
people think they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, a lot of grows were left
intact up there, but a lot of strains were
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: By just attrition or by?
[SPEAKER_00]: By both.
[SPEAKER_00]: By both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross breeding the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pollination that people didn't
really know where that pollen came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had some great sticky weed in
the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The late 80s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where were you growing in the late
80s, early 90s?
[SPEAKER_00]: San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about the SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still have that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it for 27 years, continuously
cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's the history of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually came in through Point Magoo
Naval Air Station in a backpack from those
[SPEAKER_00]: old Navy SEALs that were working in that
camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Afghanistan, that's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bag of seeds, you know,
directly out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what made that a standout cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Purely a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the original PK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's original name was PK, you know,
the Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the original SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an ivy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just compared to like
your Northern California indica plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that were nice and uniform and bushy and,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grew up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing, you switched it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its initial stretch could be as much as
two or three feet in 11, 12, 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining a light height on those was
just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, super hard, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your bud structure was nowhere as
close together as the indicas out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would be like a bud and then
a blank spot for eight or nine inches and
[SPEAKER_00]: another bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was like an ivy plant just
going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting that plant to respond properly
and get a tight bud structure was just
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really a tough, tough play.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your farm called?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so Mr. Nice Guy LLC is our farm
in Santa Barbara that's licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Half Baked?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need Dave Chappelle as a brand
ambassador.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
