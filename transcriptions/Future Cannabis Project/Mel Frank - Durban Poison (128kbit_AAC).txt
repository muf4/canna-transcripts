[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had the original Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went to Amsterdam and became
something entirely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not entirely different, but quite
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that I had, the one that I
really liked, actually I just lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never went to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two different lines of the Durban.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an A and a B.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A happened to be the one that I liked
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a real licorice flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had purple stigmas, which you just
don't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I wish I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have now is a much more
commercial rendition of what went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that problem was that I made a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really embarrassing, but I gave
Skunkme and Sam an Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them the Durban, the B line,
but the B line had a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodism in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it when I gave it to him
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find this out until many years
later when he told me he had to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, work with it, work with it,
to get rid of their hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part of what changed that line a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavier yielder now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as sativa-like as it was when I
first got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most unusual plant that I would
say variety that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen individuals that were pretty
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a variety, it was just very different
from anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing was what a short season it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were harvesting it here in Oakland in
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I brought it to New York,
this is about 60 miles from New York City,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were harboring some of that in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being from the East originally,
my whole thing with breeding when I came
[SPEAKER_00]: out here was to develop cultivars that
could mature back East before the terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: weather came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the people I knew who grew back
there, they were basically growing leaf or
[SPEAKER_00]: really crappy Mexican that had some
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a situation out there where I went
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already had hybrids, F1s of things like
Afghanian Congolese, Afghanian Nigerian,
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanian Durban, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I went back and I took those sativa
crosses and I back crossed them again to
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani to try to make sure that we got
the shortness of Afghani in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did fantastic out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people couldn't believe how strong
that pot was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had never experienced anything like
it in their lives.
