[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very pleased to be moderating this
panel today, really looking in depth at
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the lessons from early regulated
markets across the country, including
[SPEAKER_06]: California, Oregon, and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, Lindsay Robinson, California
Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to pass this over to Caitlin
first off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Caitlin Erso.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work for the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been with CDPHE for 10 years in
January.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a mechanical engineering degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have played several roles at CDPHE from
writing actual regulations, writing
[SPEAKER_05]: drinking water regulations was one of my
first roles, to doing community outreach
[SPEAKER_05]: projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: The role that I'm in now is very dynamic
and interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm basically a free environmental
consultant for all small businesses in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally happen to specialize in craft
brewing and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people laugh and say like,
is that your real job?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are two small business sectors in
Colorado that are large growth industries
[SPEAKER_05]: that both use a lot of environmental
resources just inherent in their process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's kind of the nexus of my
role.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really I'm here to just help make the
cannabis industry more environmentally
[SPEAKER_05]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to follow that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my name is Jesse Peters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a co-founder of Ecofirma Farms,
which was a cultivation operation up in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sold that business in June of 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time that we sold it,
we were cultivating indoor cannabis for
[SPEAKER_04]: $189 a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were doing it on 100% renewable energy
and we were almost carbon neutral.
[SPEAKER_04]: I since then have founded Mantis Growth
Investments.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are an MSO consolidating companies
primarily across the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was a founding member of the Oregon
Cannabis Association and still a board
[SPEAKER_04]: member there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Gary Corlatt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an engineer with Southern California
Edison.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work in our energy analysis and customer
outreach organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with our business customers with
energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been doing that for about 10
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through that time, I've been working with
our agricultural customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the last four years, I've been
dedicated to indoor horticulture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's dig in.
[SPEAKER_06]: As many of you know, if you operate in
California, we have local and state level
[SPEAKER_06]: laws that govern what you can do in
various jurisdictions across the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is a very complicated patchwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some communities that are quite
friendly to cannabis and are regulating
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturing, distribution, retail,
cultivation, and some where it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: complete ban, de facto prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd love to talk first off with Gary
just a little bit about what you see in
[SPEAKER_06]: the challenges, particularly in Coachella
Valley and what some of the main factors
[SPEAKER_06]: that you focus on currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the main issues that we have in the
Coachella Valley originally were that our
[SPEAKER_03]: infrastructure wasn't capable of providing
the power that's required for these
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The initial investments there were made in
desert hot springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city, in their wisdom when they
were doing this, decided that they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to make a cannabis business park.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did that in an area of desert
that was zoned for five acre single family
[SPEAKER_03]: homes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And suddenly we have actually about 12
different facilities there in about 30
[SPEAKER_03]: acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each of them takes about one to five
megawatts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the same as having a megawatt
that serves about 750 homes in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the same as having between 750
and 3,000 homes on a five acre lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can kind of jump on this from a lot of
topics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a really kind of important
one to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas California and Oregon kind of did
the same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have this free market for licensing,
which I am a huge fan of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because whereas some people say it's a
race to the bottom, I would say it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: race to be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are looking at building a
cultivation facility in desert hot springs
[SPEAKER_04]: and your exit strategy, hopefully that you
have one, is to be acquired by someone
[SPEAKER_04]: else in the future, I can tell you
personally as a West Coast MSO operator,
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not looking at your company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are looking at potential for interstate
commerce when we move forward in the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: California and Oregon are known for
growing a large quantity of the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: country's cannabis in the North,
where you can get power for better prices,
[SPEAKER_04]: where there's renewable resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as much as I appreciate all of it,
I think it's, you know, when you hear
[SPEAKER_04]: these numbers not only coming from a power
perspective or coming from an
[SPEAKER_04]: environmental standpoint, but you have to
think of it economically as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your exit strategy?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your plan?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everybody who goes to work every
day has an exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to retire.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got an exit strategy if you
haven't thought about it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's either that you're going to
retire from this company and give it to
[SPEAKER_04]: someone else, which means it needs to
substantially survive through what is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be a very difficult and
tumultuous market over the next two
[SPEAKER_04]: decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you need to think of where it's at and
be really efficient with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that listening to these
things and heeding warnings to thinking of
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're doing moving forward is
crucially important at conferences like
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they covered it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the only thing that I have to
add is, you know, coming from Colorado's
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective and being one of the most
mature markets in the country,
[SPEAKER_05]: we, you know, we learned a lot of hard
lessons really early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also there was a lot of fear around
being the first to legalize in the way
[SPEAKER_05]: that we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so all of our regulatory structure was
centered around safety, security and no
[SPEAKER_05]: diversion to the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Environmental and efficiency standards
were not considered.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's why we have the situation in
Colorado where most of our cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: grown indoors under lock and key.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it creates a lot of environmental
detriment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know, we as going through
the process with with California over the
[SPEAKER_06]: last several years, we have tried to look
at Colorado as as a roadmap on what worked
[SPEAKER_06]: and what what didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say, a lot of California
regulators did not really heed a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: the warnings that we saw from Colorado and
have implemented regulations in California
[SPEAKER_06]: that are that are that are proving to be
problematic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think one of the things that we
talked a bit about earlier and we really
[SPEAKER_06]: also wanted this to just be a conversation
amongst us and then obviously open it up
[SPEAKER_06]: to all of you and be able to learn from
each other is the stress on the on the
[SPEAKER_06]: grid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that you're seeing a really
dramatic case of that down in the in the
[SPEAKER_06]: desert areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you expand a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've gone through if there's been
any significant complications that have in
[SPEAKER_06]: some ways affected people's businesses or
their ability to to maintain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Desert Hot Springs is actually one of
the better examples of what we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: able to do to accommodate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're real close.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have wind power that's out in that
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's designated for other parts of the
grid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it means that we have a distribution
level or I'm sorry, transmission level
[SPEAKER_03]: substation in in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to expand an existing
distribution substation to provide a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of power and we were able to
bring power in from other areas to support
[SPEAKER_03]: the facilities there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other extreme to that is California
City.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where that's a community that's basically
was a retirement community.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no no industry to speak of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a large housing tract that was
planned and power was put in for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it never developed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that allowed us to pull some power.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the major issue is that they again put
all of their cannabis facilities in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis business park that business park
is located half mile or so from the
[SPEAKER_03]: nearest distribution line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only for electricity but also for
gas and water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they basically nobody out there has
power or any other utilities there because
[SPEAKER_03]: of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the other extreme.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those unfamiliar with it and we're
kind of newer into the California market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize that I'm not completely up
to speed on on all California regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no one's allowed to hold me to any of
this disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no there's a green zone up around
Arcata where California established some
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations that removed the taxation and
basically said for lack of a lot more red
[SPEAKER_04]: tape apply for a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay the fee and it's yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to play the game of
continuing to look at regulation upon
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation upon regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so of course for me looking at MSOs
this this is a giant flag waving around
[SPEAKER_04]: the sky that says come by my company
because if you think about the way the
[SPEAKER_04]: California market works and some of the
things that in my opinion we're starting
[SPEAKER_04]: to see as an issue in California is you're
looking at the the every as everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: makes regulation and we spoke about this
earlier Santa Barbara just came out and
[SPEAKER_04]: said that you can cultivate cannabis and
we are doing that there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh by the way wait you can't dry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your plan with all of it when we
got done growing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you look at this regulation and now
we've got to figure out what we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to turn it to fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to ship it to a drying
facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know when I send it to the manual to
the processor I need to pay a cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when the processor sends it to
the manufacturer to package it they need
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay a manufacturing tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you send it to the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pay a distribution tax and then they
give it to the delivery or the retail
[SPEAKER_04]: where you pay a tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm spending sixty two dollars for
a gram of cannabis that's been handled
[SPEAKER_04]: forty seven times in a bag that I can't
see or potentially even recycle when my
[SPEAKER_04]: friend Rick has been selling me bags for
40 bucks that now grows like 18 different
[SPEAKER_04]: strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all of them and it's still 40
bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we have a giant market in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we're figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you look at the green zone you
look at this space where I don't have to
[SPEAKER_04]: pay any of that tax in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we get really efficient with those
locations and I don't pay all that tax in
[SPEAKER_04]: the middle and we vertically integrate
ourselves throughout there maybe we can
[SPEAKER_04]: start getting a product to consumers at a
competitive price and start getting the
[SPEAKER_04]: unregulated market to want to come into
the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the goal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean I guess again I think that there
are a lot of lessons that we're learning
[SPEAKER_06]: in California real time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We obviously have we you know the the
local access and local control has been a
[SPEAKER_06]: huge component of how California has
regulated cannabis which has turned some
[SPEAKER_06]: communities into much friendlier zones
than others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then even within those communities
they have green zones or areas that are
[SPEAKER_06]: much more friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But oftentimes we've heard from our
members that those areas are not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily conducive for running
businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think you know we touched a
little bit about on that with access and
[SPEAKER_06]: just overtaxing of the grid especially and
then really just making sure that these
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses are kind of you know grouped
into a certain area I think is beneficial
[SPEAKER_06]: in certain ways but also problematic in
others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're like I said trying to figure
all of this out in real time in
[SPEAKER_06]: California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's basically like running a small
country or even a medium sized country
[SPEAKER_06]: really.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we love over regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that I thought was
really interesting about what Caitlin said
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier is and I'd love for you to
elaborate on your 30 different
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you know one of the things that
the roles that I play is I am researching
[SPEAKER_05]: the air quality impacts of the cannabis
industry something that not a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people are talking about besides you know
the secondary impacts of power generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But inherent within the cultivation and
processing is is air emissions terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: are volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not just an odor nuisance volatile
organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a slide on this but I'll show it to
you guys in a little bit volatile organic
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds are ozone precursors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ozone is toxic for us to breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an it's an issue that that's pretty
big in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the way that we legalized
marijuana in Colorado not only did we
[SPEAKER_05]: force it all into indoors but we zoned it
industrial and we put all these other
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory restrictions on setbacks from
schools and other cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean there's a lot of regulation
surrounding where you can grow marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it did is it forced about 60 to
70 percent of the cultivation into our
[SPEAKER_05]: metropolitan area.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why that's important is not
only we stressing our grid but we're
[SPEAKER_05]: stressing our municipal drinking water
supply our wastewater effluent our air
[SPEAKER_05]: quality because ozone is VOCs and
combustion emissions combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you put it in the city that's
where all of our power plants are.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where all of our traffic is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where all of our combustion
activities are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just compounding issues with
the way that we legalized enforcing you
[SPEAKER_05]: know what should be an agricultural
commodity into a literally manufacturing
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah and I think one of the items that we
had touched on earlier as well is that you
[SPEAKER_06]: know in in you having conversations on the
regulatory level in terms of air quality
[SPEAKER_06]: compared comparing Colorado to California
I'd love for you to highlight an example
[SPEAKER_06]: of how difficult it is to regulate here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah so in Colorado we have one Colorado
Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_05]: Environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: California has many many many just from an
air pollution standpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they have over 26 air pollution
districts that all make up you know one
[SPEAKER_05]: big carb California Air Resource Board.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you know when I am working with
other states and other entities to try to
[SPEAKER_05]: educate them on these issues and inform
them about how to make smart policy it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really difficult when you go into a state
like California to advise them and you've
[SPEAKER_05]: got this whole patchwork of not only
different regulations per area you have
[SPEAKER_05]: different regulatory bodies you have
different perspectives you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot so it you know what takes one
phone call to educate another state like
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe you know Michigan or Oregon takes
about 30 phone calls to educate California
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's all piecemeal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes they don't all talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Surprising.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well maybe this would be a good time for
us to segue into your PowerPoint because I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that that will generate more
conversation amongst the panelists but
[SPEAKER_06]: then also it's just a ton of information
that we hope you all can will comment on
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first two slides we're going to share
as a group and we're really going to focus
[SPEAKER_05]: on the environmental impacts of the
cannabis industry and not just the energy
[SPEAKER_05]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that this conference is really
focused on the energy impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to click it for me I can just
cue you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to point out the other
environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just inherent in the cultivation
and processing of cannabis there's many
[SPEAKER_05]: environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've talked about energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what about water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whether you're growing indoor or
outdoor there's water impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: In an indoor environment you're taking the
drinking water water supply that's treated
[SPEAKER_05]: to drinking water standards and putting
that towards an agricultural commodity
[SPEAKER_05]: that has a lot of energy impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a lot of energy to treat that
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's there's also an outdoor
environment indoor outdoor use.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also have a lot of irrigation systems
and you need to be efficient with those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that kind of gets that water
efficiency in an outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got runoff and erosion issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also indoor you've got wastewater
effluent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're putting all those pesticides
nutrients you know you got to be aware of
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're putting down the drain because
those wastewater municipalities that
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't traditionally set up to support a
large influx of indoor agriculture are now
[SPEAKER_05]: taking on that burden.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's a lot of waste from the
industry plant waste universal waste like
[SPEAKER_05]: your lighting your ballast your electronic
waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also hazardous waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your leftover solvents cleaning
supplies chemicals those types of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned air emissions terpenes are
volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a really great slide to explain why
that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also just you know be aware of
the chemical use associated with
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got pesticides pesticides fertilizers
solvents and outdoor a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also got a lot of rodenticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just kind of being aware of this
inherent in the process whether you're
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor or outdoor there is a environmental
burden that you're putting on the
[SPEAKER_05]: community and we all need to be smarter
about how we run our businesses to reduce
[SPEAKER_05]: that burden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to turn it over to these two
guys to comment on environmental impacts
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I look at a lot of these and
obviously we look at environmental
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiencies right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also look at economic efficiencies
and you start looking at these things and
[SPEAKER_04]: you look at for example water treatment
irrigation runoff erosion wastewater
[SPEAKER_04]: effluent and you start thinking about if
I'm in a facility where I pay a water bill
[SPEAKER_04]: and I pay a sewage bill and eventually I'm
told I need to start separating out my
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizer which should be something I'm
doing on my own.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start looking at a cost associated to
that and that cost association breaks down
[SPEAKER_04]: to price per gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is going to be a cost on how much it
cost me to cultivate hands down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I look at my competitor who says
in agricultural land they're on a well
[SPEAKER_04]: they have literally dug a hole and got
native plants that all of their runoff
[SPEAKER_04]: goes into and cooks off all of that which
is a fancy bioswale.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end it's cooking off all your
nutrient that is if you're using too much
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have just erased that cost from my
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're competing and this goes down
plant waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I an ag land where I can put a fence
around it put a camera on it and I can let
[SPEAKER_04]: it compost and then I can reuse it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have to use that compost and then
save myself on fertilizer or am I using a
[SPEAKER_04]: dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I having to pay to have it removed
through waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you having to mix it with 50 percent
non-marijuana waste before you put it in
[SPEAKER_05]: the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we go through this chemical use
pesticides automation to understand that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're using the exact amount of fertilizer
that we need to use at the exact times
[SPEAKER_04]: under the exact conditions per strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: The research that we talked about
yesterday when you're a cultivator and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know we're all kind of used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got these cultivators all of us I've
been guilty of it a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well we can figure that out later because
the margins are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three years ago I had a two years ago I
had a conversation with cultivator from
[SPEAKER_04]: here in California said we get twenty
eight hundred dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to change for at least
three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what my price per pound is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't called him lately but I got a
feeling that that is not his statement
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you look at all of those pieces and and
you think to yourself well I have time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have time to get to it or I need to be
able to produce a facility to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are decisions that need to be
made now while you have the time while
[SPEAKER_04]: those margins are there.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what your equipment says it can
tell you it's 99 percent efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day you have humans
running these machines.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be 99 percent efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about you know even when you take
the plant material out of the system after
[SPEAKER_05]: it's gone through it's you know it's
regenerative evaporative process.
[SPEAKER_05]: That those inherent within that plant
material is still going to be solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all that's going to continue to
off gas that those solvents butane propane
[SPEAKER_05]: ethanol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again I'll talk about the importance
of VOC in a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also CO2 releases you know you can use
pressurized CO2 for extraction as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's CO2 releases from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also you know worth noting in the
indoor cultivation environment there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of CO2 supplemental CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's used within that environment as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then once that solvent is spent it doesn't
last forever right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to dispose of it as hazardous
waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those are other environmental
impacts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then being aware of plant waste too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know there's all these regulations out
there especially in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a 50 50 waste mixing rule where
you have to mix it with 50 percent non
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana waste before it can leave the
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doubles our landfill footprint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly we don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a lot of issues with people stealing
trash marijuana trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something I'd like to see a
change to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have seen a positive regulatory
change as of January 1st in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We now have a rule where the composting
truck if it rolls up under surveillance
[SPEAKER_05]: and the dumpsters under lock and key of
the plant waste by way of the truck taking
[SPEAKER_05]: that dumpster and putting it in the back
of the truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your 50 50 waste compliance point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that also makes composting more
accessible for cultivators because you pay
[SPEAKER_05]: per pound to compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're doubling the amount that you
have to compost you're doubling the amount
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to pay to compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just things to be aware of that it
doesn't just stop at the cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: environment that it's also processing and
then you know distribution as well with
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the packaging and distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah I think that California's had a
hard time learning these lessons from
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado especially around the
environmental waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think having a few years advance on
California has really shaped and informed
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulations that you're now dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again we're a larger state but I would
love to hear maybe a little bit on Oregon
[SPEAKER_06]: on how how things are going up there with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know waste management in Oregon has
been.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been I would like to say easy in the
sense of it hasn't been over regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that being said when we look at
processors and you know honestly there is
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of stuff that Oregon is starting to
look to Colorado for a lot of the studies
[SPEAKER_04]: that are being put out now what we're
talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be sensible for us to
turn to when it comes to waste management.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as farm waste management we're
we're looking more towards regulators in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon are concerned that that there's
diversion potentially happening through
[SPEAKER_04]: waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when Oregon looks at waste it looks
more on the regulatory side of diversion.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is rapidly going to change probably
across the industry but especially in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon and looking to Colorado on the
processor side because just the volatile
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals the VOCs the look towards what
is happening as we can refine that down
[SPEAKER_04]: with processors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that Oregon is going to turn to
a higher regulatory stature there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that that's obviously going to affect
pricing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's another one of those things
talking about where if you're trying to be
[SPEAKER_04]: economically viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Building a C1 D1 facility even though
you're not required to and always trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to be have ingenuity in trying to decide
how you're going to handle waste with a
[SPEAKER_04]: moral structure that not only goes behind
environmentally friendly but also
[SPEAKER_04]: considering what could happen regulatory
wise in the future and being prepared for
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're juggling all this.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to go into a little bit more
Colorado specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: Issues and some of the work that I'm doing
just very briefly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say that because this could
literally be a three hour conversation and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do my best to keep it very
short.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why are VOCs important.
[SPEAKER_05]: We mentioned that VOCs are coming off of
the plants as they grow in the form of
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got mercine pining limonene
terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all being released into the
atmosphere and those are volatile organic
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens to be that the terpene emission
profile associated with cannabis is highly
[SPEAKER_05]: reactive for ozone formation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when VOCs go up into the atmosphere
they react with other types of pollution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those other types of pollution are
specifically nitrogen oxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get nitrogen oxide from combustion
sources cars power plants oil and gas
[SPEAKER_05]: activity anytime you're burning something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be agricultural burns.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be wood burning activities.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's combustion there's going to be
nitrogen oxide again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really important for Colorado we we are
not meeting EPA health standards for
[SPEAKER_05]: ambient ozone concentrations already.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we regulated cannabis in a way
that we forced everybody into our
[SPEAKER_05]: metropolitan area co-located next to all
of our sources of nitrogen oxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we don't know right now is how many
pounds of VOCs are emitted per pound of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a question that I'm trying to
answer with my research currently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a research grant through Colorado
Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_05]: Environment where I'm actually collecting
air quality samples at commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation environments to answer this
question of how many pounds of VOCs are
[SPEAKER_05]: emitted per pound of marijuana grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we're able to answer that question we
have really good plant count tracking or
[SPEAKER_05]: you know production tracking in Colorado
through our marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_05]: division.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we can couple it with that data
with okay how many pounds of marijuana are
[SPEAKER_05]: grown in the state and where what are all
the other sources of nitrogen oxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And VOCs and really at the end of the day
come to how much of our total ozone
[SPEAKER_05]: problem in Colorado is attributed to the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people they hear my research and they
think that maybe I'm picking on cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do this for all regulated industries in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know what everyone's air
quality impact is in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And typically when you get new industries
that come online EPA the Federal
[SPEAKER_05]: Environmental Protection Agency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would be the one to do this type of
research to universally establish what we
[SPEAKER_05]: call emission factors pounds of VOCs
produced per pound of marijuana grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: EPA is not going to do that for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Colorado is stepping in and trying to
fill that gap in knowledge for other
[SPEAKER_05]: states.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the first one to research this
issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: There there is other studies that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: However when Colorado looked at those
studies we didn't feel they were robust
[SPEAKER_05]: enough to base you know any regulatory or
policy decisions on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also worth noting that cannabis is a
agricultural process especially the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation not the manufacturing but the
cultivation is an agricultural process and
[SPEAKER_05]: agricultural processes are exempt from air
quality regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the end of the day this is just fact
finding.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know what the impact is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other states and Canada do plan to make
regulatory policy decisions based on this
[SPEAKER_05]: research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something to know about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mine was only going back to the last
point like we talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: This opens up a space eventually to start
looking at incentives to get away from
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial zones that could create this
ozone from VOCs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because originally like Oregon we talked
about when they were looking at scent
[SPEAKER_04]: mitigation they were looking at it because
politicians were considering what voters
[SPEAKER_04]: were telling them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so somehow I got invited to be on the
three person commission to decide how we
[SPEAKER_04]: were going to regulate the scent which is
essentially the VOCs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I loved about it was the other
two people was the owner of fresh filters
[SPEAKER_04]: who make carbon filters and the owner of
can fans who make fans and hook to those
[SPEAKER_04]: filters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going out on a limb here I feel as
though maybe there's an agenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so of course we created indoor
agricultural rules around evacuating all
[SPEAKER_04]: of the air through a carbon filter that
need to be changed on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's there's better ways to do
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously I believe that this study I
will work with the OCA and we will attempt
[SPEAKER_04]: to push down this path for something a
little more logical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course try to incentivize those
that are in the right zones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also to I mean this research is a
benefit for industry too because right now
[SPEAKER_05]: no one's really quantifying the emissions
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And carbon filters are not one size fits
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know these specific molecules that
you're trying to capture within that
[SPEAKER_05]: carbon filter you can actually manipulate
the pores within the carbon filter to be
[SPEAKER_05]: just the right size to capture those
specific emissions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can be a lot more efficient if
you know exactly what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: control.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the other piece of this too is
you know by capturing these VOCs within
[SPEAKER_05]: the carbon you're controlling odor but
you're also controlling the VOC so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: not emitted into the atmosphere and then
you're not getting that those ozone
[SPEAKER_05]: impacts as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this really puts a new lens on odor
mitigation and that it's not just a
[SPEAKER_05]: nuisance.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is public health impacts and there's
probably going to be some regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: impacts down the road based on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll move to fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a project that I hold near and
dear to my heart and it was in the news a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys have heard about it I'm
excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know I mentioned before that I
specialize in helping both craft brewing
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannabis become more environmentally
friendly in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw this project as an opportunity
to bring those two industries together in
[SPEAKER_05]: a way that's economically and
environmentally viable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what's happening here is the first
picture is at a brewery a local brewery in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado Denver Beer Company and those
shiny tanks behind us are the fermentation
[SPEAKER_05]: tanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last step in the brewing process is
where the yeast eat the sugars.
[SPEAKER_05]: They produce alcohol and CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: We keep the alcohol in the beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2 just gets vented.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is at every craft brewery.
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2 is just vented in large large amounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very it's a big source of CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now at larger scale breweries like
Anheuser-Busch and Coors they capture the
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2 and compress it off the fermentations
and reuse it back in the brewing process
[SPEAKER_05]: because we carbonate our beer with CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: We pressurize our lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use it as void space within the
fermentation tanks because oxygen is bad
[SPEAKER_05]: for beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use a lot of CO2 but all that CO2 at
craft breweries that's used within the
[SPEAKER_05]: process is purchased from an outside
supplier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they purchase CO2 and they generate
CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when you look at the cannabis
cultivation side photosynthesis it takes
[SPEAKER_05]: light and it takes CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that process the plant is taking in
that CO2 stripping the carbon using it as
[SPEAKER_05]: energy for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a carbon sink.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes in this carbon and it breathes
out the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with this project we are capturing CO2
off the breweries fermentation tanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're putting it through some really
great technology that's provided by
[SPEAKER_05]: Earthly Labs that basically scrubs that
CO2 and compresses it and then we release
[SPEAKER_05]: it within the cultivation environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So projects gained a lot of press support
from the governor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just been it's been really great all
around to work with these folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Governor Polis actually came and toured
both the cultivation facility and the
[SPEAKER_05]: brewery and did a press release on this
because it's a really great illustration
[SPEAKER_05]: of small businesses coming together to
combat climate change essentially in a way
[SPEAKER_05]: that's economically feasible for both of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: These projects are both the brewery and
the cultivation have a 22 month ROI that's
[SPEAKER_05]: less than two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It saves during the pilot phase when we're
only feeding one bedroom and one flower
[SPEAKER_05]: room at the cultivation it saves a
thousand dollars a month right off the
[SPEAKER_05]: bat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we get it up to scale at the facility
it'll save the cultivation facility six
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's huge savings and that's CO2 that
would just otherwise be vented from the
[SPEAKER_05]: brewery and it becomes a revenue stream
for the brewery.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that exciting?
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevada brewery or Russian River or you
know there's a lot of different options
[SPEAKER_06]: for California to take on that model for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah and since we proved that it's both
economically and environmentally feasible
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no reason that this can't be
project that can't be repeated.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need someone like me and the
government pushing and rallying behind
[SPEAKER_05]: this project to get it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys can just do it yourselves but it
helps to have somebody like me rallying to
[SPEAKER_05]: be like do this and we hope to see it be a
repeatable project and I think we're
[SPEAKER_05]: running a little short on time but I
wanted to just briefly cover some
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory lessons from Colorado and so
we've taken a little bit different
[SPEAKER_05]: approach than some of the other states
when it comes to environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiencies for the cannabis industry and
that we don't mandate them we just open up
[SPEAKER_05]: our regulatory structure to allow them to
make those more environmentally friendly
[SPEAKER_05]: decisions because if we force them they're
they may not be economically viable and so
[SPEAKER_05]: that's that's kind of a different
philosophy that we have in Colorado but we
[SPEAKER_05]: allow fiber recovery for an exemption from
the 50-50 waste rule if it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: fiber recovery.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned in the previous session if
you guys were here we allow take back
[SPEAKER_05]: programs at retail facilities for
packaging and vape waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also allow e-waste recyclers to process
marijuana vape cartridges without a
[SPEAKER_05]: special marijuana license because the
intent is recycling and we allow for
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigation of hemp with reclaimed water.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's mostly because hemp is grown
outdoors in an indoor environment we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: allow that in marijuana because that
reclaimed water could aerosolize bacteria
[SPEAKER_05]: and viruses so can't do it inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And better access to composting like I
mentioned allowing the the composting
[SPEAKER_05]: truck to pick up your plant waste put it
in the back and that be the point of
[SPEAKER_05]: compliance for the 50-50 waste rule.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously amazing lessons to be learned
from from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: California is a little slow on the uptake
on a lot of those and you know I think
[SPEAKER_06]: that there's certainly ways that we can
build on the knowledge of other states.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd love to hear from folks if you have
any specific questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you measuring.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is for Caitlin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you measuring VOCs at the like at the
unit level at grow rooms or is it
[SPEAKER_08]: estimated based on production and known
releases.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we actually took samples at the exhaust
points to measure what is the the output
[SPEAKER_05]: for ozone.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we also took samples within the
cultivation facility in the veg rooms in
[SPEAKER_05]: the flower rooms harvesting processing so
that we can get unique emission factors
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of add up to that ratio of
exhaust so that because every facility is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be different and we can't just
say the exhaust from one facility is going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be the same as another.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want to get that relationship
established between activities that are
[SPEAKER_05]: happening within the cultivation facility
compared to what's at the exhaust point.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of our samples to were taken pre
carbon filtration because again carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: filtration is highly dependent on on the
size of the pores in the filter.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your HVAC exchange flow rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have it too high what's the
temperature what's the humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so variable on what is going to be
that carbon filter efficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we only did pre carbon filtration
basically without any controls.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the contribution to ozone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it parts per billion that you measure
it in or depends on where we're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And harvesting for sure is more parts per
million when you're in flower and veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought this was going to be about
growing mediums.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you all express your opinions or just
thoughts on sustainability issues related
[SPEAKER_07]: to peat moss first cocoa and where that's
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean yeah so we all know that
sustainability wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cocoa is better than peat moss right like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of been the standard statement
for a while even though we have some new
[SPEAKER_04]: peat moss beds coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Canada we're saying no it's actually
just as sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a debate that can be had
over and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for mediums and we worked a lot of
this at eco before we sold that company
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's something that I definitely look
forward to working with with some of our
[SPEAKER_04]: new companies is the thought process of
being able to recycle your soil whether
[SPEAKER_04]: you're using peat moss whether you're
buying and mixing your own whether you're
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing it in through bags you know a lot
of farms it's really commonplace that you
[SPEAKER_04]: use the soil you put it a lot of times in
a cloth bag that is thrown away at the end
[SPEAKER_04]: and not cleaned or if it is going into a
pot that's being recycled they're still
[SPEAKER_04]: taking the dirt and they're dumping it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bringing it into landfills or
composting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're 50 50 mixing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality with some soil science and
some work if you were on the right
[SPEAKER_04]: property you could you could regenerate
that soil and continue to reuse it with a
[SPEAKER_04]: good IPM program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that is something that we
really need to look at is cultivating
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivators and all of our cultivation
methodology for sustainability to say that
[SPEAKER_04]: my cocoa is more sustainable or less
sustainable than my peat moss is a moot
[SPEAKER_04]: point if I'm recycling whichever one I
have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah and I also think to the illicit
industry plays a really strong role in a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of the environmental issues that we're
seeing in California because it is
[SPEAKER_06]: unregulated and we're seeing massive
pesticide use and trash and debris and
[SPEAKER_06]: discard and you know that those that soil
is often being put into large contractor
[SPEAKER_06]: bags and being brought to the dump and I
totally can understand the dank dirt
[SPEAKER_06]: confusion on that I just I just put that
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah I think that you write the more
regulated the industry hopefully the less
[SPEAKER_06]: environmental issues you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again when we look at California
we're not able to regulate any or recycle
[SPEAKER_06]: any packaging yet and we are going for the
most environmentally unfriendly packaging
[SPEAKER_06]: protocols possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of it is because the industry is
the right on the regulated side is is
[SPEAKER_06]: really struggling in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of it is just trying to put
out fires to stay alive with the hopes of
[SPEAKER_06]: tackling some of these environmental
issues and in the next few years to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you were fairly
successful in accommodating the growers in
[SPEAKER_01]: desert hot springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if let's say Jesse is correct and
maybe they aren't the most sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: business model and longer term do you have
a backup plan because I know working with
[SPEAKER_01]: smud they accommodated all these growers
in a very specific region and upgraded
[SPEAKER_01]: their distribution facilities and then
those growers have a lot of them already
[SPEAKER_01]: taken off to go grow in like the central
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you planning for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we are we are looking at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you exactly what that plan is
because I'm not involved with it but our
[SPEAKER_03]: main concern from from the very beginning
has been stranded assets out in these
[SPEAKER_03]: remote locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The you know we're we're kind of in a bind
because we're we're obligated to provide
[SPEAKER_03]: power to anybody that asks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we try to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ways that we offset that is
because it's a high risk industry we're
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to charge them a little bit of the
cost upfront.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that they they have to share in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it still leaves us with the potential
of stranded assets.
[SPEAKER_03]: The the desert hot springs area at Lanto
area those areas are are pretty well built
[SPEAKER_03]: out with other industries that can pick up
that that load.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other areas like California City
where there are no other industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a concern out there to
provide.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've kind of seen a rise in non volatile
extraction methods and production
[SPEAKER_09]: especially among smaller midsize
producers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if you've taken a look at that at
all to assess if if they're more
[SPEAKER_09]: environmentally friendly and you know why
couldn't they get be a green zone unto
[SPEAKER_09]: themselves and get some tax breaks to to
you know emphasize non volatile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I think that's a that's a really
great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know our regulatory structure is
constantly evolving and you know I would
[SPEAKER_05]: like to see more of an incentive structure
for instance in the in the CO2 project.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually no tax breaks involved in
that at all and there should be we should
[SPEAKER_05]: you know just like we get tax breaks for
solar we should have you know carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: capture tax breaks that are there to
incentivize.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have incentives for these take
back programs that we've now allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's in it for the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we're we're trying to pitch it as
you know you'll get loyalty points for
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe bringing it back and good customer
retention and you know get better at
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly I think there should be some
tax breaks for that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that with cannabis being so
new in Colorado kind of leading the way
[SPEAKER_05]: we're still kind of fumbling around in the
dark and trying to figure out what are
[SPEAKER_05]: those policies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you know organizations like this
and Derek's resources Innovation Institute
[SPEAKER_05]: and all in in CIA all of those those
bodies out there that are built on
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing us together and bringing
government and cultivators into the same
[SPEAKER_05]: room to have these conversations is really
really essential so that folks like myself
[SPEAKER_05]: can go back to the government and say hey
this is what industry is asking for that
[SPEAKER_05]: last slide I landed on all of the
environmental efficiency regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were all new of a January 1st this
year and that was all because our
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated cannabis industry worked with
our marijuana enforcement division and
[SPEAKER_05]: made them make those changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So be a voice that's heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to add kind of a side note on
that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the challenges that we've had
in California is is creating a sustainable
[SPEAKER_06]: and workable workable social equity
program.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for lessons to be learned from other
states I would say don't follow
[SPEAKER_06]: California's lack of leadership on that
because we don't have a statewide program.
[SPEAKER_06]: That can help folks enter into the
industry there's really high barriers
[SPEAKER_06]: there's obviously it's hard to access
capital there's no traditional banking
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're trying to transition you know
into a legal market and you know you're
[SPEAKER_06]: coming from a community that's been
severely disadvantaged and targeted by the
[SPEAKER_06]: war on drugs it's it's almost
insurmountable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a patchwork of regulation
on the local level and anything that we do
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of trying to lower barriers to
entry often has to go through the
[SPEAKER_06]: legislature.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you guys have ever dealt with the
California legislature it's pain in the
[SPEAKER_06]: ass and it takes a really long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would say be very thoughtful
about those are things that states can be
[SPEAKER_06]: very proactive on and can learn from the
mistakes that we've are making and
[SPEAKER_06]: probably will continue to make in
California.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado does not have a social equity
program either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to point out to you from
an environmental justice standpoint with
[SPEAKER_05]: the way that we zoned cannabis and we
forced them all into our industrial zoned
[SPEAKER_05]: areas those are also our poorest
communities those are also our sickest
[SPEAKER_05]: communities those are also our most
diverse communities.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know those are our health equity
environmental justice priority areas in
[SPEAKER_05]: our state and we force the cannabis
industry to operate solely in those areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that's something
interesting to point out when we're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about social equity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Question in the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to say the brewery CO2 to
cannabis projects just about the coolest
[SPEAKER_10]: thing I've ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_10]: So so two questions on that one is is
there is there any report or data or
[SPEAKER_10]: something publicly available those of us
who are interested in it can learn more
[SPEAKER_10]: from.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the second is is there an
estimate of what percentage of the CO2
[SPEAKER_10]: that's absorbed by the photosynthetic
process ends up being re released via
[SPEAKER_10]: being lit on fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are definitely in the data
collection phase of this project right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are one month in to capture Mr. Jared
Polis was so excited about our project our
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado governor that we did a press
release after only capturing and
[SPEAKER_05]: successfully doing the project for one
week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a three month pilot time frame
where we are collecting data points to
[SPEAKER_05]: beer quality on on plant quality on
logistics of the capture on the carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: footprint of the trucks going back and
forth compared to you know vehicle miles
[SPEAKER_05]: traveled from a traditional distribution
system of having a bunch of CO2 loaded on
[SPEAKER_05]: a truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually trucked from much farther
away because it comes from a power plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a byproduct of combustion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an environmentally friendly
practice in itself to capture that CO2 off
[SPEAKER_05]: of off the power plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we truck it a very long way to
get it to both the cultivation and the
[SPEAKER_05]: brewery.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want to look at that and then to
get at your question of you know what is
[SPEAKER_05]: the CO2 sequestration rate of marijuana in
an indoor grow environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that I would love to
study and I want to study but I cannot get
[SPEAKER_05]: the funding to study it because the
ultimate pathway for cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's something to be aware of at
least from you know public health and
[SPEAKER_05]: environment is you know if we're looking
at life cycle analysis knowing the CO2
[SPEAKER_05]: sequestration rate of the plants is kind
of a moot point if the ultimate pathway is
[SPEAKER_05]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when we look at the via you know
the environmental benefit of this project
[SPEAKER_05]: we're mostly focusing on the vehicle miles
traveled and reducing that that burden
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that there is some environmental
benefit of taking you know what would be
[SPEAKER_05]: just vented from the brewery and feeding
it to the plants because it doesn't all
[SPEAKER_05]: end up in combustion but you know it could
ultimately end up in the landfill as well
[SPEAKER_05]: or you know when we compost plants I want
everyone to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes composting is one step above landfill
but when plants biologically break down
[SPEAKER_05]: they release methane and CO2 and we should
be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those can be used as commodities if we
change the way we manage our waste stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we didn't have this 50 50 waste rule we
could have on site anaerobic digestion of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis plant material where we are doing
this in basically a black box breaking
[SPEAKER_05]: down that plant material then we can
capture the methane as a commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Methane is natural gas we burn it and also
CO2 I mean that's a commodity as well that
[SPEAKER_05]: we use within our our grow rooms and our
extraction processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another opportunity there with
the plant waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got a little off track on your
questions but I hope I answered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is for Caitlin as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the brewery to cannabis project I
was curious you'd mentioned that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger breweries capture on site and
reuse and I was curious was there a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular driver for these smaller
breweries to capture and then sell off
[SPEAKER_00]: site rather than to reuse on site.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah so brewery depending on the size of
the brewery they are going to generate way
[SPEAKER_05]: more CO2 than what they need in their
process and actually when I ran into
[SPEAKER_05]: Earthly Labs at the Colorado Craft Brewers
Conference and they showed me their
[SPEAKER_05]: technology and their plan to implement it
their plan was to just implement this
[SPEAKER_05]: technology at breweries to only capture
maybe 15 to 20 percent of their CO2
[SPEAKER_05]: emissions because that's all they need as
input to the rest of their process and
[SPEAKER_05]: then they just vent the rest because
there's no economic driver there and when
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that my jaw hit the floor I was like
from an environmental standpoint capture
[SPEAKER_05]: as much as you can from an economic
standpoint capture as much as you can and
[SPEAKER_05]: sell it and so this is really the first
time that that's been that this has been
[SPEAKER_05]: done but I'm you know I'm really excited
about this project because I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: such an inspiration point to start looking
at waste as a commodity to start looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at partnering with different industries to
create independent localized economies
[SPEAKER_05]: among small businesses you know we just
cut out a large CO2 company by doing this
[SPEAKER_05]: there wasn't very happy about it but you
know it's new ways of thinking and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that one thing that I always like to drive
home to people is this is true today and
[SPEAKER_05]: every day moving forward we have the most
amount of people on this planet and the
[SPEAKER_05]: least amount of resources we've ever had
we've got to change the way we do things
[SPEAKER_06]: great well I want to thank the experts on
this panel for all of your wisdom thank
[SPEAKER_06]: you so much for for sharing it with
everyone today and we hope you all enjoyed
[SPEAKER_06]: it thank you
you you you you you
