[SPEAKER_06]: So I can start with one answer,
and that is that to give you an example,
[SPEAKER_06]: we often say, well, let's give this
product for pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we really do need to be more specific
when we talk about pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of pain are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it chronic pain?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it acute pain?
[SPEAKER_06]: So to just say pain is not enough,
so that's number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing is we need the tools to
measure the outcomes that we're looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before we even talk about the products
that will ultimately end up being in the
[SPEAKER_06]: patient's hands, I think we have to
carefully select what it is that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to just say we're going to give it to
patients with pain or to patients with
[SPEAKER_06]: Alzheimer's disease or to Parkinson's is
not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to be very clear about
what the outcomes are that we're looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from that potentially will stem the
development of new cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think also part of it lies,
for example, in the National Academy of
[SPEAKER_03]: Sciences report, which basically said
there are only three indications that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is conclusive or strong evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was chronic pain, and I agree with
Pierre over there that pain is
[SPEAKER_03]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's neuropathic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's FM.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spasticity due to multiple sclerosis
and nausea and vomiting, particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: chemotherapy-induced.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest were considered low level of
evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a tremendous unease by physicians
to prescribe for other than those big
[SPEAKER_03]: three at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are all accumulating data.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is, I am, on some of these lesser
indications like Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pharmaceutical companies are looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the absence of data, physicians
don't feel comfortable at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to generate more data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the things we heard in our
section was trying to do observational
[SPEAKER_03]: studies, try to do registries,
try to collect more data.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be indirect evidence to then
lead to further clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a slightly different opinion,
but related.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the issue with there not being more
medical products in the market in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis states as being a problem of
education and economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most doctors and patients in the medical
side of cannabis don't know what to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the economics right now favor adult
use products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the world that we live in,
economics drives most things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other alternative is demand from
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when patients don't know what they
don't know and what they should be asking
[SPEAKER_00]: for, there isn't going to be the creation
of the next generation of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's meetings like this where
you have both folks that have the capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: to create new products and the researchers
who know how to determine whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: effective is where we're going to get to
the next generation of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the things that are in our way are the
economics of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm from GB Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow and we extract and we make
products both in Nevada, which is now an
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use market, and in Louisiana,
which is a medical-only market for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing, at least in Nevada,
is that a lot of the people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing product and a lot of the
dispensaries that are delivering products
[SPEAKER_00]: to patients have sort of downplayed the
importance of having medical products on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a real barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can innovate all you want,
but if no one will put it on the shelf and
[SPEAKER_00]: no one knows why it's better, you'll never
sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could mention, in my earlier talk,
in our panel, in microscopes we talk,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are three parts of education.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is, butt tenders are not educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: A recent study showed 90% of them have had
no real education.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to certify them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Physicians, we talked about in our panel
before, they're not educated either.
[SPEAKER_03]: At UCLA, we tried developing a physician
manual.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then thirdly, consumers, any of us,
have similarly gone into a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is like a night.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a jungle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I get a blue dream in this
dispensary, it's not the same as the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's very confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to have some better labeling
would help education as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then comes a great segue to the
machine side of the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Schmalhauer and Dr. Stewart both
mentioned that products are part of that
[SPEAKER_05]: problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where are the guys that are creating
the supply chain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are we missing the mark?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a vicious circle because
you've got a customer base that only knows
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to buy high THC stuff because it
gets you the highest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that drives the growers to grow
only THC heavy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, the minor cannabinoids have
suffered for all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there labeling issues with regard to
minor cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're not on the label,
how do you know that they're there?
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, they're on the label.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not on the label here in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the concern from the manufacturing
viewpoint that it's not on our label?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the concerns?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because you have to assay for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: It really actually comes down to the
legislation side because they actually
[SPEAKER_02]: only allow you to place, I mean,
I guess you could put an extra sticker on
[SPEAKER_02]: the package that says that, which I think
smart companies do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to prove what you put on your
label.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to prove it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess people are more comfortable
with just dealing with THC and CBD because
[SPEAKER_04]: of the error bars involved on some of
these smaller amounts of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're doing at JETI is we're
actually looking at types of plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that'll yield higher yields of the minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows about CBG hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're currently working with Doug Zveren
and trying to get a very high THCV product
[SPEAKER_04]: out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, when we're going to go ahead
and label this, I'm not going to sit there
[SPEAKER_04]: and talk about, probably talk about the
CBN content because I'd really don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: to worry about the analytical numbers
failing my THCV product, which is what
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going after because my CBN counts
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does that mean we need legislation to
actually be more transparent at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they need to just, I mean,
the labeling requirements are really,
[SPEAKER_04]: so if you look at the number of fails last
year, so this was reported between,
[SPEAKER_04]: when it was first implemented between
August or July 1st and August 29th,
[SPEAKER_04]: four times the number of failures.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were 10,000 samples submitted.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were 1,200 failures because of
labeling, because the testing didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: confirm the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next most was pesticides at 400.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a manufacturer out there,
it's a big risk because if you fail
[SPEAKER_04]: labeling, I believe you only have two
chances to remediate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they do the testing, your stuff's
already in the device.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really not very much fun to have
someone come tell you, hey, Wyatt,
[SPEAKER_04]: this failed for pesticide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's all these vials.
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Act like it's a Greek wedding and start
crushing them all?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the risk is that if you include CBG and
THCV onto your labeling, that's going to
give you a higher risk of failing,
especially with the testing labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can send the same product to four
different labs, and you'll get four
[SPEAKER_05]: different returns.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of the concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just in general, yeah, that's kind of
the concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Packaging costs money, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So consistently, I can produce the same
amount of THCV and THC every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me to start worrying about all the
other little blips, I mean, they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: unimportant little blips, but they're not
on our marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're selling to a market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're selling THCV.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not selling you 20 to 1 THCV,
CBN, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, testing's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they would lay off on this aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what they're concerned with is
overdosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a dosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what they're concerned with is
dosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they were thinking when
they wrote the law, but that's my best
[SPEAKER_04]: guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as someone who has helped regulators
who are trying to decide how to set limits
[SPEAKER_00]: for testing, one of the things that I
think is unanimous is that most regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do right, but they're so
overwhelmed because they just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what, they understand that
there's economic importance to not
[SPEAKER_00]: overburdening the industry with too much
testing, but they also want transparency
[SPEAKER_00]: for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regs are a whole other level of
complications that are in place that are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make it harder to get more
complicated medical formulations to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, but anything worth doing is
usually hard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't mean we shouldn't do it,
but right now, we can't look to our
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators to help because they're barely
keeping up as it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We touched on dosing,
[SPEAKER_05]: so what's going on with it, and how can
these two segments here, these microscopes
[SPEAKER_05]: and machines, the doctors and the
manufacturers come together to help solve
[SPEAKER_05]: this problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard the terms earlier today about
individualizing therapy was one term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Individualizing therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and then we have another term which
I've used, which is microdosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question I have is if you have a
fixed amount in an edible, how do I change
[SPEAKER_03]: that dosing for a given patient?
[SPEAKER_03]: So clearly any delivery device such as
tinctures or sublinguals which allow me to
[SPEAKER_03]: dose as a physician is an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I see the future of cannabis-based
medicines is that we need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring alternative delivery methods
because one of the things that's known
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabinoids as a class is that
they're like oil and water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies are mostly water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids are lipids, and they don't
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bioavailability, or in other words,
the ability for the active compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to interact with your bodies are
limited based on that whole oil and water
[SPEAKER_00]: dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the next generation of
cannabis-based medicines have to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: account that we can do better at delivery
methods that not only will provide
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency in dosing, but higher
bioavailabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the things that are within
reach are things like oral thin films and
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you're sort of on the
periphery of the market that will not only
[SPEAKER_00]: give more confidence on our dosing
abilities, but also help with this
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bioavailability is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take oral CBD, the oil is somewhere
between 13% and 39% bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's that great variability.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's face it, it's pretty darn low as
well, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Up to 39%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what, you're wasting 60% of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a real shame.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree with you entirely that we need
to look at how we're going to formulate it
[SPEAKER_06]: so that the product is a lot more
available.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to talk a little bit more about
dosing, I mean, we're looking at a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: The milligrams, the milliliters,
the percentage of each, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as an industry, we're not
going to be able to focus on everything at
[SPEAKER_06]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to need to prioritize
what illness is, for instance,
[SPEAKER_06]: we want to look at.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to decide that and then get it
right in that area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from there, I think we can move to a
next and a next and a next.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, what I'm seeing,
the other day, somebody asked me about,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, what do you think about CBD in
diabetes?
[SPEAKER_06]: And my jaw fell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But do we really want to go there right
now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, because I think that there's
a lot of other diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think as an organization,
we need to decide where do we want to
[SPEAKER_06]: start, start there, get it right on this
one, and move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, it's helter skelter.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the machine side?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we work together?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hitting a dose is fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much just simple math and
formulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as bioavailability is concerned,
some of the more water-soluble components
[SPEAKER_02]: may have better affinities across some of
our membranes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those products are fairly available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it can be created as your own product
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick question on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone know of a consistent,
vapable dosing device?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there was a lot of controversy at
ACS for a year ago about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say you did a puff test and
measured whatever your device pulled for
[SPEAKER_02]: one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about when you actually take a drop
of your vape pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you inhale that vapor, the majority
of it you're actually exhaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even those type of puff tests are a
tough correlation between what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually getting and is retained in the
lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good option, but it's tough to
test.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it that it's easy, but it's not,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we have to look at the particular
indication, and we have to figure out what
[SPEAKER_06]: works for that indication.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, when I look at everything that's
available from the LP's in Canada,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm baffled because there are no two
companies that have the same kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: product, the percentages and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just simply don't get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask for one thing, I get something else,
and I don't really know what my patients
[SPEAKER_06]: ultimately are getting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we need to look at the
indication, try various things,
[SPEAKER_06]: lower CBD, higher THC, microdosing,
titrating up, et cetera, until we come to
[SPEAKER_06]: a conclusion that, hey, this seems to be
what works best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we can turn to you guys and say,
can you make this for us?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, exactly, that's what I was gonna
say.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the horse pulling the cart,
if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, one of the things that I
see when I look at, I've spent a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time looking at the randomized
placebo-controlled trials that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and dug deep into myself,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that is most
frustrating to me is that in most cases
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was a really well-controlled
trial in that the design was
[SPEAKER_00]: well-controlled, the materials that the
subjects were given were incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like we're trying to,
it's like you've got those people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to read the tea leaves,
okay, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we expect to have interpretable
results from randomized trials if the
[SPEAKER_00]: materials people are given aren't
standardized and dosed properly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's our job on the machine
side to be able to provide very
[SPEAKER_02]: intelligent doctors like yourselves
specifically isolated cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we can combine those with maybe some
genetics tests or specific data that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: back from a specific AMA to custom tailor
different ratios of these cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: both common and uncommon cannabinoids so
that we can actually specifically target
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's our job to provide those for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we haven't been doing our job
telling you what we need, because we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can't do the research,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back to the economics, who pays for
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultimately the money's gonna have to come
from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big driver isn't isolated
cannabinoids right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's large-scale, it's large amounts of
oil to the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing that's driving production
right now is not isolation.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we've talked about a few different
times, though, that all the research and
[SPEAKER_05]: development on the machine side is
self-motivated and self-funded.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really think some of these doctors
are gonna start coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GB Sciences for the last five years has
been doing drug discovery work and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: funded research at nine different
universities through the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the first places that we have to
start, and Travis, you and I talked about
[SPEAKER_06]: this a little bit, is so we're giving this
stuff and we don't even know what the
[SPEAKER_06]: profile is pharmacokinetically in the
bloodstream or in the body, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So every drug that's ever been marketed,
we know the pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know how it's distributed, the time
course, where it goes, how it's excreted,
[SPEAKER_06]: how it's metabolized.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know all of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for these products, we know none of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I give one ml or if I give two or if
I give this or that, I have no idea what
[SPEAKER_06]: that looks like from a pharmacokinetic
profile in the body.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how can I expect any sort of
pharmacodynamic effect if I don't even
[SPEAKER_06]: know what it does?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if what they're taking
is actually having a blip in their
[SPEAKER_06]: bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it getting to the brain?
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I'm not saying to go sample in
the brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you see what I'm saying is we have no
notion of the pharmacokinetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how can we possibly expect miracles to
happen until we study that and know a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit more about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to blow your mind even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a lot of time researching
complex mixtures of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and looking at
pharmacokinodynamics and how having
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple things in biological systems
changes the curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the pharmacokinodynamics of
each of the individual compounds and you
[SPEAKER_00]: compare that to the mixtures, they're
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's both the power in cold plant
medicine, but it's also the curse,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you control the chaos for good?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much individual variability did you
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the individual compounds,
it's pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you start to do the mixtures and
there's significant differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking a lot at receptor-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing really detailed sort of
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing receptor-based occupancy site
stuff to show how they change each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the problem with, not the problem,
is that the challenge with science in
[SPEAKER_05]: this, specifically for these compounds,
is that there is, we're doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that we're looking at pharmacokinetic
studies that are targeting one molecule
[SPEAKER_05]: and throwing them all close to the body in
a numerous way in the liver systems,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we're measuring that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But is that actually the problem that we
should actually be delivering a full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum product into the body and doing
our studies on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And is it the system of how drugs get from
concept to good that it is the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly we would agree to that because
we've got our drug discovery program based
[SPEAKER_00]: on complex mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, we know that there will be
a day of reckoning when we go to the FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: with a complex mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spend a lot of time working out for
every individual compound in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the receptor where does it hit,
how do they affect each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's so much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, when we look at
the sort of potential, these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the pre-clinical studies,
these mixtures have such a great,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's enough of a difference in the
clinical potential that it's worth the
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the only way that the
cannabis-based medicines are ever gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: live up to their promise is if we go for
complex mixtures, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna elaborate on that because if
you look at drug discovery traditionally,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a really interesting model because we
used to get all our medicine from plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as chemistry developed,
we were able to start figuring out what
[SPEAKER_04]: was the most important thing in those
plants that was doing the thing we wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, okay, well let's say let's apply
our chemical knowledge to it and transform
[SPEAKER_04]: that thing, right, and make it even
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is what happened with opioids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a tug of war actually between
traditional one compound, one drug that
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of thing, and then these mixtures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even when we're talking about a
mixture of terpenes, I just showed earlier
[SPEAKER_04]: that these mixtures of these essential
oils gets ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just gets absolutely ridiculous,
and they're not all terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't know if our model,
so all our science right now, I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: say all of it, a lot of our science right
now that's funded, that's accepted,
[SPEAKER_04]: is all based on the premise that there is
this magic bullet that is out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we just find that magic bullet,
it's gonna cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's really tough for us as
scientists to take 200 compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, when we take 200
compounds, we have to show that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to show where they go,
how they're excreted, what dose they're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these one compound, just one compound,
can take a billion dollars to get to y
[SPEAKER_04]: 'all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone wants to say, there's some
great pharmaceutical conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's us, it's our regulation body.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no scientist that I know in the
lab who ever said, boy, we're gonna make a
[SPEAKER_04]: blockbuster, we're gonna make some mad
books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's out there to help people,
it's just we're stuck in this model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess as a cannabis industry,
I mean, there's a lot of people basically,
[SPEAKER_04]: we talked about this, who don't want their
stuff extracted in heptane or
[SPEAKER_04]: dichloromethane because they believe in
green solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a really interesting time for
Western medicine because we're starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: try to adapt our roots to what we have
become.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to say, let's go back to
plant medicine and now let's make it fit
[SPEAKER_04]: our new model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's gonna be heck expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really know what the answer is
as a chemist, but I just wanted to put
[SPEAKER_04]: that out there, make sure it was said.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a physician, I would feel very
uncomfortable starting to prescribe a
[SPEAKER_06]: single molecule because now I think I'm
going down the pharmaceutical route and if
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the route I'm gonna take,
I'm gonna say go the FDA route.
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me the evidence, do clinical trials
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there is with cannabis,
medical cannabis, je ne sais quoi,
[SPEAKER_06]: that is that magical thing that the
mixture ultimately has a co-effect that
[SPEAKER_06]: works and I'm happy to try it in my
patients and relieve their suffering.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am just not going to go down the road of
prescribing a single molecule for an
[SPEAKER_06]: indication that I have no evidence it
works for.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just not gonna go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the industry has to be very
careful not to go down that route if
[SPEAKER_06]: ultimately what you want is for physicians
to prescribe because I think we're gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: hit a wall there, right, until the
evidence is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may want to go down that route for
recreation or other purposes, but I think
[SPEAKER_06]: when it comes time for physicians to
prescribe the single molecule thing may
[SPEAKER_06]: fall flat.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my two cents worth about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think if you're willing to
prescribe a broad spectrum and not an
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate, you might be splitting hairs
there a bit, but just because the broad
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum is no more validated than the
isomer, right, or the isolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, except though that there is
potentially a co-effect of these things at
[SPEAKER_06]: the cellular level that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm ignorant, I admit it, but it seems
to me what I'm seeing is an effect when I
[SPEAKER_06]: give this oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what the properties are
in there and that's why ultimately I'd
[SPEAKER_06]: love to know if what I think is working is
even getting into the body.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sooner or later we're going to
have to, you know, to do a spinal tap on
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody and get a sample of spinal fluid
and find out if there is anything that's
[SPEAKER_06]: getting into the brain ultimately because
here we are talking about how great this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff is because it's working on my mom's
head and we don't even know if it's
[SPEAKER_06]: actually getting into the CSF,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The blood brain barrier is a very,
very important feature of controlling the
[SPEAKER_06]: environment of the brain and we can't take
it for granted that everything is getting
[SPEAKER_06]: through and particularly in the amounts
that we think it's getting through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I use that just as one example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: To switch gears a little bit, I would like
to hear what your most optimistic view is
[SPEAKER_05]: of the future of this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see in the future?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see it coming to?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Open to Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think what I'm seeing today is
very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing us getting together,
talking, starting the discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we wouldn't have seen this a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got highly qualified individuals who
know the chemistry, who know how to get
[SPEAKER_06]: this stuff out, and now we're getting
physicians and we're all at the same table
[SPEAKER_06]: together talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think already we've achieved what I
consider to be a very optimistic future
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think that this is the beginning of
something really great.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want to say, and this is as rec
producers, we have a lot and a lot of data
[SPEAKER_04]: out there that's free to us potentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know PAX?
[SPEAKER_04]: PAX, I believe, is building a database for
people to react to their products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can go onto their app, which
controls your temps, and you can react to
[SPEAKER_04]: a product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as recreational producers of a
product, I think it's also an important
[SPEAKER_04]: thing that we also develop some kind of
consumer feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's really great about what I do is
I have all the data, I have all the
[SPEAKER_04]: chromatic diagrams of my essential oils
and my cannabinoids and they're all just
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting in my shelf to make sure it passed
regulatory compliance or my curiosity or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now if I have 17 people come back and
say, hey, this really helped with my
[SPEAKER_04]: migraines, well, I have a place to start
at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's a lot of accidental
things that can happen out there and we
[SPEAKER_04]: really, I mean we have big data,
we have the internet, it's all there for
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to start giving our customers
giving our patients a good way to
[SPEAKER_04]: interact, give us data, and then sort of
find a good way so that the physicians and
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists studying this can receive that
data in a manner that they would most like
[SPEAKER_04]: to receive.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's basically gotta be some
collaboration here between the scientists
[SPEAKER_04]: studying this and the people creating the
surveys and the software.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all within reach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more that the way this
industry will move forward is if the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and the researchers are aligned
and communicate and that we get valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: input from patients because it's those
three parts that are really gonna have us
[SPEAKER_00]: create the next generation of
cannabis-based medicines that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized, that are easier to dose,
and they're more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that last piece is the hardest one to
get at, but I think that with these kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of dialogues we can get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you see us succeeding now today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you see the crossover really
succeeding and moving forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the good news?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the good news?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the good news?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are getting relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and significantly cheaper now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it sucks for all of us in the
industry who are literally breaking our
[SPEAKER_02]: bones every day to provide a profitable
product, but I mean I think in the long
[SPEAKER_02]: run it's more easy access for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patients aren't going to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived in red states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my degree in a red state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people will do anything to get their
kids some Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: In South Carolina, so they'll break the
law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are felony crimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's one of the great things
I'm seeing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we're 20 years away from the
end of Prohibition anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're less than 20.
How much less?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me just see.
[SPEAKER_04]: 3.2 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on if Trump gets re-elected.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not gonna go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is I think the farm bill in December
opened up a whole new window because CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: and CBD for hemp is not the same thing
around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can start exploring all the
different turbines associated with CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing which brought up in our
meeting was the fact that there is some
[SPEAKER_03]: willingness now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, this moment, we can actually
start doing some studies, XUS,
[SPEAKER_03]: for some products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was part of a study that we started
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't get graft versus host,
which really could save some pediatric
[SPEAKER_03]: lives, but we could start it in Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, we heard if you can start
the study elsewhere, you can create the
[SPEAKER_03]: demand to move it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So temporarily right now we're in a phase
where it's very difficult to do studies
[SPEAKER_03]: here, but we have other ways of starting
and generating research.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have mentioned education,
and I think that plays a very important
[SPEAKER_06]: role.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could see a day where we have a
medical conference where people such as
[SPEAKER_06]: yourselves who know the chemistry,
how to produce it, can come and educate
[SPEAKER_06]: physicians a little bit more about what
really goes into making this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to get physicians such as
yourself who have increasing amounts of
[SPEAKER_06]: experience with it and start educating
physicians that, hey, this is not poison.
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here are the chemists and the
producers and the guys who know how to
[SPEAKER_06]: produce it who can tell you about what
they're doing and have an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_06]: network and to understand and to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that would be a long way,
because certainly coming here today for me
[SPEAKER_06]: has been an education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to ask whether it's
possible for our machines people to all
[SPEAKER_03]: get to all the producers, as
pharmaceutical companies evolve,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get together in some way.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, to provide easy, my patients say,
where do I look for information about side
[SPEAKER_03]: effects?
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead they say, you do the Google
search, I've got a million documents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any one central place that
could give information to patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: would be really, really, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing if we can get everyone to kind
of agree, like we heard in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially to have multiple parties
contributing to a general fund to start at
[SPEAKER_03]: least pilot studies and research,
that would also be helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something we could do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interestingly enough, GB Sciences is
involved in Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one of two commercial producers who
was chosen to work with university
[SPEAKER_00]: partners who hold two licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's unique about the Louisiana
market is that they have a pharmacy-driven
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of your standard dispensaries,
they have to have licensed pharmacists on
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have staff to counsel
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going into this market, we did this on
purpose because we think that there has to
[SPEAKER_00]: be someplace where we have really
responsible medical markets being
[SPEAKER_00]: fostered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've worked hard to try to put
together responsible advice for the
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians and the doctors in Louisiana
based on evidence-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really challenging because you
know what's in, anyone who's looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: that literature, it's not robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to have a place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more information that we can give
to pharmacists and doctors, and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be disseminated to the patients and
stakeholders, I think that's how we could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially get this medical ecosystem
around cannabis to evolve, by having the
[SPEAKER_00]: right stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that we have producers and that
we have researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many parts of the ecosystem
that need to be involved in getting better
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to patients, including the
evolved patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Louisiana's not the only state,
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several states now that require
better pharmacists, which is a great step.
[SPEAKER_04]: I follow Medscape.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also an MRI tech, and so I do like
to read what doctors think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Medscape is basically just kind of a
e-magazine for doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they came out with a list of
contraindications in terms of medicines
[SPEAKER_04]: that aren't compatible with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I mean, we definitely have to start
with hooking up patients with that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that can happen in the US
on a national level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe our neighbors up the north can help
us out building some kind of government
[SPEAKER_04]: agency that could give Americans with
access to the internet at least some idea
[SPEAKER_04]: of contraindicated medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the US, you need to really get
the whole legalization process.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think working on legalization,
I know there's some efforts.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the big elephant in the room,
as far as I'm concerned, is the US being
[SPEAKER_06]: unable to ultimately legalize this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's face it, the US is the driver of
almost everything medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: And without having the US on board,
it's very difficult worldwide to really
[SPEAKER_06]: move this beast forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in the next 12 months,
there has to be a lot of concerted effort
[SPEAKER_06]: on trying to get governments and
legislators to appreciate the fact that
[SPEAKER_06]: this is here to stay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we might as well all work together
rather than butting heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that for me, the possibility since
the farm bill is I've seen institutional
[SPEAKER_03]: review boards, regulators, starting to
ease up in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's some options.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if we just start with studies with
CBD alone, I'm thrilled that we broke the
[SPEAKER_03]: barrier and we're going to start doing
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about to happen in the next 12
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing is the issue about
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of initiatives right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can convince either state or federal
to start educating people, whether it be
[SPEAKER_03]: butt tenders, whether it be butt tenders,
doctors, or patients, I'll be thrilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the three is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll see an influx of more
diverse cannabinoids, which hopefully will
[SPEAKER_02]: fuel a lot of the studies and research
that gentlemen and ladies like yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we'll see a lot of
improvement on the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of equipment to get to those
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about the hemp
industries?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The California market needs to stabilize
in terms of the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Wild West here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Went to Colorado and I was just thoroughly
impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first dispenser I went into was
Colorado the day after it opened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the prices then, and then the prices
now, and also the regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thoroughly impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So California and markets like that need
to stabilize better so that producers can
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out, and also farmers, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody can figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're going to see some more
clarification in what's going on with new
[SPEAKER_04]: compassionate care laws coming and maybe
some modification of tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tax policy, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would not invest a dollar of my money
into isolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would instead look at distillate for
one reason, FDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you're all aware of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a CBD based drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: So CBD isolate is now competing with a FDA
approved drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the history of these things aren't
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the nutraceutical market.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there is a precedent with a,
I think it's called the red rice
[SPEAKER_04]: precedent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't remember the exact compound,
but basically there was a compound that a
[SPEAKER_04]: company, from red rice, a company patented
it through the whole process and got it
[SPEAKER_04]: through the FDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they wanted to shut all these red rice
nutraceutical people down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what ended up happening is it was
proven that while full spectrum red rice
[SPEAKER_04]: extract was actually medicinally used
before you made your drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that full spectrum hemp
extract, whatever that means, was used
[SPEAKER_04]: before Epidiolex came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my position.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to wait for the FDA to be more
clear on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they really want Congress to go
back and define it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were really confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 2020, we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there Democrat, Republican who controls
the White House, who controls the
[SPEAKER_04]: Congress?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of agree with what everybody else
has said with respect to in the next 12
[SPEAKER_00]: months, I believe the hemp act or the farm
bill is going to really help shape the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can't, we can't assume that
things that happen over there won't affect
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, when I think about the most
optimistic view for the next 12 months,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to sort of the global market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are places in the world that
are more progressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're not careful, they're going
to, well, some of them already have a lead
[SPEAKER_00]: on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the global market in the next
12 months is going to be really moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas we're going to be looking at the
details of the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: A dynamic industry to say the least,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really appreciate all your perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give them a round of applause.
Thank you.
