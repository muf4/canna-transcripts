[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from a philosophical background,
I thought it might be fun to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether permanency is a valid concept in
relation to California cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, considering that really in
the grand scheme of things, this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: another little tiny seed of evolution in
the process that's going to be dialing in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to talk about what has just
happened is that on Monday, December 3rd,
[SPEAKER_00]: the three major agencies of California
cannabis, the BCC, Bureau of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Control, the Department of Public Health,
and the Department of Food and Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted their final regulatory language
to the OAL for review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no further public comment at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, we were going to have
totally peaceful, happy holidays in
[SPEAKER_00]: blissful ignorance of what the regulations
were going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't going to publicly share them
until after January when they became
[SPEAKER_00]: active, but they changed their mind
because, you know, a lot of people wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to know what it said so they could prepare
for when they become immediately active as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as the OAL approves them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why we're doing this now,
because now we know what it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're starting to sort it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OAL has 30 working days to review the
regulations that were submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they use that full time,
they have until January 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're imagining it's going to be about
January 16th is when they will become
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the role of the OAL, if you don't
know, it's the Office of Administrative
[SPEAKER_00]: Law, is to confirm that the regulations
proposed by the agencies is actually in
[SPEAKER_00]: alignment with statute, with what was in,
what was in MCRSA, what's in the Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Professions Code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things have to align.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a small possibility that the
OAL could find something that they decide
[SPEAKER_00]: is not in alignment with MCRSA and strike
things or reject them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not a lot of anticipation of
this happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general anticipation is that the
language that's in there now is what we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have to deal with when, in January,
when it kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until that time right now, the emergency
regulations are still in effect and will
[SPEAKER_00]: remain in effect until January 16th when
the new regulations take effect
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately upon adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was lots of adjustments,
lots of things that were proposed that
[SPEAKER_00]: carried over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have, Josh is going to talk
through a lot of the things that impacted
[SPEAKER_00]: the licensing aspect of those regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Josh Singer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My portion of the presentation is going to
be a little bit of an update on what's new
[SPEAKER_01]: for those of you who are submitting
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting with, we're just going to do a
quick overview of this is not exhaustive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a number of the changes that
took place in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these are actually were first put
in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were put in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these were not put in in the most
recent, but we're going to talk about them
[SPEAKER_01]: now that it looks like they're going to go
into the permanent regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to do a quick overview and
then just go into more detail on each of
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the BCC decided that they
did not like everyone submitting their own
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures for review and instead has
chosen to create these forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were initially put together in the
first round of permanent regulations in
[SPEAKER_01]: June and now it looks like they're going
forward with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of you, I think, know about these,
but that's where they're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, they took out, more recently
in October, they took out the waste
[SPEAKER_01]: management procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, those of you who have already prepared
those for your annual application,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't look like they're going to be
going through those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, there were some slight but
significant changes in the definitions of
[SPEAKER_01]: owner and in what needs to be disclosed
with your financial interest holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four, the license fees,
at least for the BCC, changed and thank
[SPEAKER_01]: God for that because the previous
licensing fees did not make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five, and I'm sure a lot of you are
very interested in this and want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: more, we're going to go into a little bit
more detail on the expiration of temporary
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses, at least what we know right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number six, there are new OSHA
requirements for applications to all three
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last, with the CDFA, there's a very
minor change in the premises diagram
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements and in pesticide
requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's go on and talk a little bit
about the forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put up the section up there just so
anybody who wants to look at this after
[SPEAKER_01]: the presentation can take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the basic idea is that they replaced
the regulations regarding the procedures
[SPEAKER_01]: that needed to be provided in the annual
application with forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of everyone submitting separate
procedures for your non-laboratory quality
[SPEAKER_01]: control procedures, your transportation
procedures, all of these sets of
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures that they previously asked in
the annual application, instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: creating your own and then having the
state get back to you and let you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that they want this or that, and whatever
it is they want in those procedures,
[SPEAKER_01]: they created forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been a lot easier if they
told us about these forms at the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, but this is a trial and error
process for the state agencies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is how they're doing it,
at least for BCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to note within these forms,
while the general topics for the different
[SPEAKER_01]: forms are the same as they were
previously, what they're asking for in the
[SPEAKER_01]: forms, some of them are surprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't clear regulatory basis for
what they're asking, so you have to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: very close look at those forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we went through them, we noticed that
there were some subjects that it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: occur to us would have to be in the
procedures, and they stick them in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people wouldn't think that they
have to submit certain things in those
[SPEAKER_01]: forms, and you do, so read those over
carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for those of you who previously
submitted your procedures, the question is
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you do now that the regulations
changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since these original forms came out in
June, what they did is initially they did
[SPEAKER_01]: not give anybody bounce backs asking you
to fill out the forms until the very end
[SPEAKER_01]: of August.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of clients who submitted
way earlier who did not hear anything
[SPEAKER_01]: about the forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no question that you had to look
back at the forms or do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the very end of August, the state
started telling anybody who submitted
[SPEAKER_01]: annual applications, again, from the BCC,
they started asking you to refer to the
[SPEAKER_01]: forms, and they had this legalistic
provision in their letter that said,
[SPEAKER_01]: while we have not finalized the permanent
regulations just yet, we do want you to
[SPEAKER_01]: use the forms as a framework for what
you're submitting to the BCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried to, since many of our clients
had already submitted procedures,
[SPEAKER_01]: we tried to adjust their procedures to
just meet what was in the forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going forward, you're going to have to
submit those forms in the order that they
[SPEAKER_01]: ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone keep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who have not submitted
your annuals, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who have submitted your
annuals but have not gotten any bounce
[SPEAKER_01]: back, you're also probably going to have
to put them in the forms, so get ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, does anybody have questions
about the forms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: So these forms, how do you get them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you download them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I already submitted my annuals
maybe about a month ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you submitted about a month ago,
eventually, unless your procedures are
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect, I think, and it's very,
at least from what I've seen, not
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody who thinks that their procedures
are perfect, they aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can download them online.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it within the package that was
released on the BCC website.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the forms that are downloadable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent in my comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my comments were, rather than
everybody coming up with their own
[SPEAKER_03]: procedures, give us a book or a booklet of
what procedures you want us to follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dealt with lots of big, big companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like J.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Penney's, for instance, before you could
start working with them, they gave you a
[SPEAKER_03]: binder with all their procedures that
covered everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The forms that you had to fill out and
sign, like quality control.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suggested that to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're changing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they still need to have what
they want and just tell us, this is what
[SPEAKER_03]: we want you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been nice had they done
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you're asking specifically
about these forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone had the same templates,
at least the same structure for these
[SPEAKER_01]: forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took your comment to heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think probably many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the problem is transitioning for the
people who did not submit those forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward, what are they going to
have?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know exactly how they're going to
integrate those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully they'll create some sort of
wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to wait until they get back to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get on to some other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for you specifically, I would wait and
see how they bounce it back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have different, depending on
the stage that you submitted, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a different request for what
you submit moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends when you submitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you submitted your annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't submitted your annual,
my recommendation is as part of your
[SPEAKER_01]: annual, you use the forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you submitted previously,
at least the stages that I've seen are
[SPEAKER_01]: people who submitted before September.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were asked specific questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they were in the forms or not in
the forms, they just asked them to address
[SPEAKER_01]: them in the procedures they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people who submitted after September,
the BCC asked to, you can still use
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures, but to use those forms as a
framework for what you submit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward, I think anybody who hasn't
submitted their annuals yet, I highly
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend you use those forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make it a lot easier for you
going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Removal of waste management procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was kind of surprising and
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a discrepancy between the
different agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the BCC took out all the specific
regulations related to waste management
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They left in the requirement that the
waste is all unrecognizable, but they took
[SPEAKER_01]: out the specific section related to waste
management procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the FSOR, the claims were that they
were redundant with the non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis waste requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the BCC stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've submitted numerous annual
applications, and they all included waste
[SPEAKER_01]: management procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like going forward, the BCC is
not asking for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know why the BCC thinks that
the regulations outside of cannabis deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, but the CDFA and the CDPH don't
agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems that there is a discrepancy
between those regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those of you applying to CDFA and CDPH,
you guys still need to have some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: waste management procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those applying to the BCC, I would
definitely, I think it's absolutely best
[SPEAKER_01]: practice to have those procedures in
place, but they do not need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: submitted with your annual applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the interesting stuff with new owner
and financial interest regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, from the very beginning, have been
telling all of our clients that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be very few, if any, ways to get
around disclosing your owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have owners, setting up multiple
layers of corporations is not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hide the individuals who are running those
entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the BCC, and to a certain extent,
the other agencies have made that clear in
[SPEAKER_01]: their regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those entities need to be
disclosed, and they need to be disclosed
[SPEAKER_01]: until they get to warm bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think you're going to submit
multiple layers of entities and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to ask who the individuals are
who own those entities, you are mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already seen this even prior to
these new regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BCC was asking who the owners were who
owned those entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you went to another entity,
they said, what about that entity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go to another entity,
they ask about that entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is going to be very little way to
get around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my recommendation to anybody who does
not want to be disclosed, you are not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to make that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any way that you're going to
get around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are going to have to come to
grips with the fact that those individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to need to be disclosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask you one more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from what I understand, say you open up
a dispenser, you can only have three
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensers because they're trying to get
that where not one entity owns too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're referring to is LA
regulations, not the state regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the state doesn't care how many
businesses you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previous efforts to try and limit,
and not even specifically retail,
[SPEAKER_01]: but previous efforts to try and limit how
much an individual owner could own did not
[SPEAKER_01]: go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did, and the one exception I don't
want to go too off track, is people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the CDFA, you are only allowed to own
one medium cultivation site.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot have more than one medium
cultivation site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to run into a report of
change of ownership every time you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: new employee that's profit sharing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a different question,
which I'm about to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Financial interest holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's now changed with the financial
interest holders is anybody who has any
[SPEAKER_01]: profit sharing, whether it be employee,
there are a lot of people who tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with different ways to hide their
financial interest holders, whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who had some sort of profit
sharing relationship, a landowner who
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to own the license
specifically, but wanted to get some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of profits from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those relationships are no longer hiding
the financial interest holders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who has a profit sharing
relationship with the entity that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: license has to be disclosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's not the same as an owner
disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In owner disclosure, you have to do an
owner submittal and they do a background
[SPEAKER_01]: check.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your ownership share is less than 20%
and you're not an officer, director,
[SPEAKER_01]: or someone who's managing the day-to-day
operations, then you are simply a
[SPEAKER_01]: financial interest holder, which means
that you need to disclose who that person
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not need to go through that
background check, but you will need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: disclosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will need to provide your driver's
license number and some other specific
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who takes on new financial
interested holders has a required
[SPEAKER_01]: notification to the agency that gave you
your license, and you will need to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that notification and send it over to the
BCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's now 10 calendar days,
if someone can correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other was 10 calendar days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they switched it to 10 calendar
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting comment was that anybody
who has employees who have some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: profit sharing relationship, if you have
25, 30 employees and they all have a
[SPEAKER_01]: profit sharing relationship, you're going
to have to disclose all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that comes out in
specific details, but according to these
[SPEAKER_01]: new regulations, everyone needs to notify
the BCC about anybody who has this profit
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation to anyone in here who
was not aware of that, I would definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: have it on your radar, and either now or
as soon as those regulations are
[SPEAKER_01]: officially implemented, make sure you make
that notification to your specific
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those financial interest holder
requirements changed in all three
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who has a state license is going
to have to make that disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: License fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CDFA and the CDPH, my review,
those did not change very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some additions in how you
calculate your annual revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there were changes as much
as clarifications and having it in writing
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly how that calculation is supposed
to be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the BCC, I'm sure there are many
people in this room who were aware that
[SPEAKER_01]: the BCC license fees did not make very
much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were very large intervals and very
large fees, but for example, they used to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, I think, $2.5 to $7.5 million in
annual revenue for a retail shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The license fee would jump I think $40,000
or $50,000, some outrageously large
[SPEAKER_01]: amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was to the benefit of the license
holder to shut down their shop for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days to make sure they don't hit
that revenue amount because it was such a
[SPEAKER_01]: large fee disparity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BCC fixed that, and now there are
smaller intervals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in general, all of the
license fees went down slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they realized that they were
unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the trial and error system,
but for those of you who are very worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about that, I think because of the
narrowing of those intervals, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be benefited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make a little bit more
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody likes paying the
license fees, so I'm not going to say it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes complete sense, but it makes a
little bit more sense than it did
[SPEAKER_01]: previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the record, the section there,
if you look in the red line, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: compare them and see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to go through each separate
license category, but they're all in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pass the most, I think the most
threshold, I don't recall exactly what the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount is now, and it depends on,
I guess, the license category you're in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's all 7.5 and higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hit that amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually just says to a top number when
you're looking at fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the license fees, so I can tell you
based on the applications, they always
[SPEAKER_01]: have the highest threshold and higher,
and that's what you're putting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: license application.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely, if for whatever reason
that's not clear in the regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume the highest category,
they can't make up the amount you're
[SPEAKER_01]: paying, so it's going to be that highest
license fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expiration of temporary licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I don't think this is new to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was one of the big items in the June
release, but the temporary licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: no new licenses or temporary licenses can
be issued after December 31st,
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, those of you who have not submitted
your application for your temporary
[SPEAKER_01]: license, it might be too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the CDFA, it's a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some of you who are still applying to
the BCC or the CDPH, you might be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get in, but it's got to get in today in
order for them to issue it before the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the year, so everyone has to make sure
that they are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that applies to all three agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason that this is interesting
is there's interplay between the temporary
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses and the provisional licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order for you to get a provisional
license, this new statutory creation from,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it was in the summer, this
provisional license where you are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay your license fees and you go on track
and trace, and then you will have a year
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's provisional license because
it's only a year, but it's more than your
[SPEAKER_01]: temporary license and it's not a regular
annual license.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order for you to qualify for those,
you need to have a temporary license,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to have submitted your annual
license, and you need to have gone through
[SPEAKER_01]: the full CEQA project and report and
submit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the area which is a little bit
uncertain is whether or not your annual
[SPEAKER_01]: license needs to be in before the end of
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've never gotten any indication from
anyone that that was the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that needs to happen before the end of
the year is you need to have your
[SPEAKER_01]: temporary issued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving forward, I would pay close
attention to that, but I was on a call
[SPEAKER_01]: with the CDFA this morning, and that was
the one agency I was a little uncertain
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BCC and the CDPH I think already made
it pretty clear that you can submit your
[SPEAKER_01]: annual in the beginning of next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CDFA, there was a rumor that went
around saying that maybe you needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: submit your annual before the end of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the person I spoke to from
the CDFA, that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can submit it next year, your annual,
and still qualify for the provisional
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that was with the phone call,
so don't take that to the bank just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for it to see it in written
form, but pay close attention to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for those of you who haven't submitted
your annual, make sure you're ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: submit that at the beginning of next year
so that way you can move on to your
[SPEAKER_01]: provisional licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okey dokey.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new OSHA requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three agencies have the exact same
text and is written right in the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have more than one employee,
you need to make an attestation in your
[SPEAKER_01]: annual application that one supervisor and
one employee who have successfully
[SPEAKER_01]: completed a Cal OSHA 30-hour general
industry outreach course offered by a
[SPEAKER_01]: training provider that is authorized by an
OSHA training institute education center
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So planning in advance, that regulation is
a clear change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make that attestation that if
you haven't done it yet, you will be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please put that into your planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: CDFA, the new premises diagram
requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is going to be a very specific
detail, but I want to throw it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have an area for segregating
cannabis or non-manufactured cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are subject to
administrative hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: For whatever reason you have issues with
the state agency and they put any of your
[SPEAKER_01]: products on administrative hold,
you need to have a separate area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily a separate room,
but a separate area to put those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is specifically for the CDFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no comparable provision that I've
seen in the other agencies, but
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically in the CDFA regulations,
you need to make sure that you have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, new pesticide requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not new, but they put it into the
regulation so that it's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have an attestation that says
you're going to contact your county
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural commissioner and make sure
that the pesticides you are using are
[SPEAKER_01]: legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who have not done that,
I would reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the county agencies, at least LA
County has been very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have people who are in the field
working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reach out to the county and
they've been very helpful to us in talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would reach out and for cultivators,
make sure that you are only using legal
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, and not in the slides,
for those of you who are concerned about
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal grows, I want to remind everyone
that the collective sunset is expiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: The collective sunset is sunsetting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you who are concerned about
people who are in that gray area where
[SPEAKER_01]: they were operating as a collective as
they have been for the last 10 years or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it may be, those collectives are
no longer going to be able to legally
[SPEAKER_01]: operate, which means that the toolbox for
both state enforcement agencies and often
[SPEAKER_01]: local enforcement agencies got much
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever is operating illegally is going to
have a much tougher time going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certain the exact date.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was based on notification of the
initial regulations or the notification of
[SPEAKER_01]: the first license that was issued.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the one year expiration began.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty certain January 9th.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not coming directly from me,
from hearing from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's January 9th, the collective sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the state enforcement agencies
will take that under consideration as they
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward and hopefully that provides
them with more tools to shut down the
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal shops and grows and whoever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the collective program in 2015,
when MALCURSA was drafted and passed,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had specifically in there that one
year from the notification of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: license being issued, you can no longer
operate as a collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would not fit under the collective
immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, unless there are any
specific questions, I don't want to take
[SPEAKER_01]: too much more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pass it on to Julie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
