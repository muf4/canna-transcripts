[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things as regulators we're
constantly looking at is how we can how we
[SPEAKER_04]: can make the supply chain more efficient
because it is a cannabis product is a very
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult commodity to get to market in an
efficient time frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're always looking at and we're also
balancing between retail and supplier and
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturer because we feel like you
can't what's good for one isn't always
[SPEAKER_04]: good for all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would love to hear from your
perspective on the things that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: control in regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you point to one single change that
would make the supply more efficient from
[SPEAKER_04]: your point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a tough one huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go out of order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say we're we're on the path to
this right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it has everything to do with
allowing co-attesting as high up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain as possible and then letting
that bulk material that's been tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: have that co-attest move through to other
distributors to co-packers to others who
[SPEAKER_00]: will handle it and put it into packages or
pre-rolls or you know go through that
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that itself would make things much
more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is much better than the
alternative of the illicit market where
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing is tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally appreciate that we want to
make sure that nothing there's no jars of
[SPEAKER_00]: flour or pre-rolls or manufactured
products that are tainted with chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: and filth and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no matter what if it passes a
co-attest at the bulk level it is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely better than what is being
sourced on the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would love to see that co-attest
for bulk product be able to travel with
[SPEAKER_00]: with that with those I'm going to use a
metric term with the package tag that is
[SPEAKER_00]: assigned to it and be and be good to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I think would actually
do something amazing in the supply chain
[SPEAKER_03]: right now is something that gets used in
supply chains and manufacturing and many
[SPEAKER_03]: many other industries whether regulated or
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's often referred to a skip lot
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the concept of when a producer or
an actor in the industry who's responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: for the quality of a product has
demonstrated that over a period of time
[SPEAKER_03]: that's specified by a regulatory body that
they're doing things correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been an on-site inspection.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been an audit of their SOPs and
from a regulatory testing perspective
[SPEAKER_03]: they're passing and not having issues that
are systemic and that are related to their
[SPEAKER_03]: their processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in many situations like that in
other industries those good actors will be
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to not test every lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that was a place based on data that we
could get to from a comfort level to say
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can verify a producer to the
extent that we can feel comfortable taking
[SPEAKER_03]: that approach to testing and approval of
products would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we're probably a bit far out
from that in terms of having the data to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to base those decisions on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would kind of going back to the
dispensaries piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get into a specific regulation but
just generally I would like to see some
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts to encourage a lot more transition
from the black market or what I'll even
[SPEAKER_01]: say is the Prop 215 crowd that are sort of
waiting in the wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd really like I think that our success
is going to depend on how many outlets and
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would encourage as unfavorable as
this might be to some people a much lower
[SPEAKER_01]: bar of entry for dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding that there's going to be
problems there but we need to have access
[SPEAKER_01]: for the public to start trusting and
wanting to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as a term I use with Andrew before we
need more carrots and less cannons to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say further this is an industry that
we're not concerned about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannons aren't that effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't been for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why we think that would be effective
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that really some creativity and
how we could encourage people to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in the regulated market at
that retail end is going to do an awful
[SPEAKER_01]: lot to stimulate growth in the supply
chain throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I would I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think on the retail end is really about
where the public facing side of the supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that goes wrong anywhere it's
always the retailers faults.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody knows who the lab is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the public ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the storefront.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're some of us are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that public health
component and child safety component is
[SPEAKER_02]: really important to the retailers and
making sure there's the story I have told
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure some people know what
happened with Maureen Dowd in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_02]: she ate too much of an edible and then
wrote an op ed in the New York Times about
[SPEAKER_02]: it and it almost completely destroyed the
manufacturing cannabis manufacturing
[SPEAKER_02]: industry in Colorado and they're still
recovering today.
[SPEAKER_02]: This happened in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so things like that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need to make sure that we're
we're doing the best to both protect you
[SPEAKER_02]: know touching on the child resistant
packaging needing to be closest to the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual product for certain products I
think is something that's very important
[SPEAKER_02]: which you've heard me say a couple of
times now different hearings and also I
[SPEAKER_02]: think some sort of just consumer education
outreach to to take down take down the
[SPEAKER_02]: illicit market encourage more people to
come into the legal regulated market and
[SPEAKER_02]: have some sort of easily accessible map.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just a quick story my mother
decided she wanted to go buy some
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She lives in San Diego County in North
County and didn't tell me which whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: and looked it up did a Google search and
found a a website that lists lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries some license some not
licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she she told me that she went to a
licensed dispensary in Vista California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like mom no I don't this does not
licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's went to some place called the
sugar shack where they sold her a 300
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was I mean the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily she knows enough to not eat the
whole thing and break it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said it actually didn't do
anything which goes to the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that whole story I was just like if my
mother who actually you know has a
[SPEAKER_02]: daughter in the industry and it kind of
knows a little bit about this and she's a
[SPEAKER_02]: 71 year old grandmother now there must be
lots of people out there that are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't even I was trying to I sent
her the spreadsheet that was on the BCC
[SPEAKER_02]: site because there isn't really a place
that I can point to that's directly like
[SPEAKER_02]: here this is a map of all of the licensed
dispensaries that you can go to and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's tested and you know this and all
of that and it's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think yeah just some sort of consumer
information so that the people that do
[SPEAKER_02]: want to go to the legal market know where
to go and can trust it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think I'm just all of these are
really great points but coming back to
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael's point about how the batches are
configured with testing from a cultivator
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective you know we might harvest one
batch from one farm of say OG Kush and
[SPEAKER_05]: then that OG Kush turns into one gram
pre-rolls and then a pack of seven
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-rolls and then eights and then
quarters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those all new have they all have
new skews to them when they go in new
[SPEAKER_05]: track and trace batch numbers when they go
to the distributor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's literally one batch of cannabis
flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us to now have to test the single
pre-rolls as one batch the five to a pack
[SPEAKER_05]: as one batch the eights as one batch is a
cost that we can't necessarily afford to
[SPEAKER_05]: sustain as cultivators putting
non-manufactured products into the
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that could be looked at as one batch
because it came from one farm was
[SPEAKER_05]: harvested at the same time was one crop
that would actually create such a
[SPEAKER_05]: tremendous amount of ease in moving these
products safely from the farm through the
[SPEAKER_05]: testing and distribution model and into
the retail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the places where we're
really struggling with timing hang ups and
[SPEAKER_05]: costs of trying to get a broad spectrum
say of non-manufactured products into the
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a sticky spot for cultivators
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think that that highlight one
of the biggest issues that we've all
[SPEAKER_03]: talked about along the way which is the
different interpretations of the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation text by different parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Chris and I had an aha moment a few
months back where one of the members of
[SPEAKER_03]: the BCC team helped us understand that as
a lab that we can actually sample as one
[SPEAKER_03]: batch pre unpacked flower eights and
quarters all together as one batch and
[SPEAKER_03]: apply the COA to all those different
skews.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in certain readings of the
regulations it was interpreted by some
[SPEAKER_03]: people as if every skew had to have a
specific COA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the case of flower which is kind of
a special case with the exception of pre
[SPEAKER_03]: rolls which is handled differently in the
new draft at least as it stands at the
[SPEAKER_03]: moment we actually have the ability now to
tighten that up a little bit and to apply
[SPEAKER_03]: one COA to unpacked flower eights and
quarters say that we're from the same
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get a memo over to our testing
facility that would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% I got the nod.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get right on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get right on that.
