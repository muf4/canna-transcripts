[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we are live on the book of faces.
[SPEAKER_03]: California operators, data geeks who look
at retail and brand data and can drop
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge and insights.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have regulation gurus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm Peter Saveri and that is me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna kick it off with Samar
from BDS who's gonna give us a quick
[SPEAKER_03]: snapshot in time, knowledge, data dump of
what she's seen in the cannabis market,
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tamar, take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be covering some high level market
insights and COVID-19 update and then
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically focusing a little bit at the
end on upcoming trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I'm hearing on the street,
not necessarily anything that we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: showing via the data, but just to kick off
the discussion in terms of what we can
[SPEAKER_01]: expect or what we can all hope to see with
the development of cannabis post these
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy COVID-19 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off with a little bit of a
higher view, a little bit of a macro
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, just to get an understanding
of the significance of the US markets
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking out and then of course,
2020 through 2020 for 2025 sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can see that currently, not
surprisingly, the US and Canada make up
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of global sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's expected to continue to be the case
through 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do wanna just call out that
obviously you have more activity from
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, US and Canada represent about
90% of all global cannabis spending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really they are the dominant
players in global cannabis at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking specifically within the US at
the legal markets, medical and adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case for 2019 and 2025,
we can see that California obviously has
[SPEAKER_01]: been and is going to continue to be one of
the primary drivers of growth for the US
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, as we look to other states
coming online, specifically Florida,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York with adult use sales,
we can expect a significant market when
[SPEAKER_01]: those come online by 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously that's driving a lot of that US
volume that we expect to see by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, all of this is accounting
for the COVID-19 impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, of course, it's important to call
out that we are going to have regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: and legislative impacts due to COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously slowing things down at not just
the federal level, but the local level as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now looking specifically at COVID-19's
impact on cannabis, so zooming in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit into the legal cannabis markets,
we can see that almost all markets posed
[SPEAKER_01]: growth in March over previous months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada is a little bit of an exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously there were a lot of significant
restrictions in the Nevada market around
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery only for adult use sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a market that's also highly dependent
on tourism, when tourism is essentially as
[SPEAKER_01]: a stand sale, is going to be even further
impacted by that lack of foot traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not surprising to see Nevada take a
little bit of a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we did see medical sales in
Nevada take a little bit of a spike.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that broken out here,
but at least medical sales were up and at
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now looking at sort of ranking of maturity
by markets, and we can see that the more
[SPEAKER_01]: mature cannabis markets actually are the
ones that fared better with the COVID-19
[SPEAKER_01]: impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not surprising, right, that the older
markets, the more mature markets rather,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously California is younger than
Oregon and Colorado, but it's in legality,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's more mature in how long it's been
operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not surprising, obviously to
see that the younger states with the newer
[SPEAKER_01]: ordinances were more severely impacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen this before, but in case we
haven't, I'm just going to focus on a few
[SPEAKER_01]: key points.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we're looking right now
across all states, not just California,
[SPEAKER_01]: all legal states in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see this surges that we've all seen
already on, of course, the Friday,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 13th, March 13th, when the pandemic
was announced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the 316 Monday surge, right,
where the shelter in place was announced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, continuing into that
following Friday, we see a typical Friday
[SPEAKER_01]: surge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, however, you see a drop
following that initial stock up,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see obviously a slight decline,
right after that initial stock up,
[SPEAKER_01]: where daily sales are falling below
average.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we can see, it picks back up coming
into 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, looking specifically at
California, we can see that the dip below
[SPEAKER_01]: average is a slight dip in those days
between the surge and coming back into
[SPEAKER_01]: 420, but not as much as all states
combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're definitely seeing California,
as we mentioned before, a more mature
[SPEAKER_01]: market that's capable of handling a lot of
these supply chain disruptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it was a demand disruption,
right, a surge in demand followed by
[SPEAKER_01]: erratic, mainly a lull.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did see in California,
more specifically, and that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: across all states, but we saw a slight
decline in daily transactions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but an increase in the average transaction
value, which is further promoting the
[SPEAKER_01]: notion that the consumers were stocking
up, right, in advance of uncertainty,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw them making fewer purchases,
but larger transactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now one of the big questions,
right, that I at least am posing to
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, and we'll keep an eye out in our
research, is this indicative of consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming more, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I mean, they're purchasing less
frequently, but they're purchasing
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly higher with each visit,
as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to blow through that
quicker now that everyone's at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I, for a fact, am a flour consumer,
and I'm definitely consuming more than
[SPEAKER_01]: normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be interesting to see if that's
something that continues across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quick question about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any indication if the stimulus payments
have played a role in sales?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually, I'm glad you brought that
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a note here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so coming into 420, we were actually
pretty concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We as an industry also, BDS and Linux,
but everybody was keeping an eye out to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how 420 would fare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you may or may not be aware,
you can see that you do have, instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: one major surge day on 420, you've got
some surge days leading up to 420,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can definitely see that when the
government stimulus checks started to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in, fortunately for everyone, just in time
for 420, as well for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, what's great about it is the way
in California at least, there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: flatten the 420 curve, motion,
I don't know if that's the right word,
[SPEAKER_01]: but incentive going around that the idea
was to prevent consumers from flooding
[SPEAKER_01]: into the shops on 420, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this obviously defines social
distancing requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's good to see that we
actually managed to flatten the 420 curve
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the government stimulus checks
coming in certainly aided with 420
[SPEAKER_01]: purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless, 420 wasn't bigger than the
surge day of March, the biggest surge day
[SPEAKER_01]: of March, March 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, March 13th was the third biggest
day in California across all of history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So March 13th or 16th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, March 13th was the biggest day
across all history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, excuse me, March 16th in dollar
sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legal tracked market history, let's just
be clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, legal California history,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's third to, I think, 420 of 2017
and 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, or sorry, excuse me,
2018 and 20, no, 2017 and 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2018, obviously, was still getting its
feet off the ground with a new adult sales
[SPEAKER_01]: and then 2020, as we can see here,
they actually managed to flatten.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not want to see a surge on 420 and
we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did, but not as big as it should
have been had we not flattened the 420
[SPEAKER_01]: curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now zooming specifically
within price point bands, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that not surprising,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to consumers making fewer
transactions, obviously with limitations
[SPEAKER_01]: on going into shops and such, and with
higher transaction values, we're also
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing that the majority of the volume
behind these transactions is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: driven with the lower price point
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consumers are buying, they're trading
down, so they're buying more cheaper
[SPEAKER_01]: products overall, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, a lot of this is driven by
flour and I don't have any slides pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: up to reflect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I intended to, but enough time,
so we can do another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you that a lot of lower
priced volume is driven by the flour
[SPEAKER_01]: category, which did see a bit of a surge
on these, or did see a bit of a peak on
[SPEAKER_01]: these peak days along with edibles and
baits, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly, looking right now just
at California and shops that have store
[SPEAKER_01]: pickup and delivery, we can see when I say
pickup, I mean curbside pickup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that following the immediate
days of the announcements and with the
[SPEAKER_01]: state allowing for curbside, adjusting
regulations to allow for curbside
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery, we see curbside beginning to
take share in terms of consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfillment type or purchasing fulfillment
type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And incidentally, that trend seems now
also delivery took share, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: While delivery maintained share,
we're actually seeing that as sheltering
[SPEAKER_01]: in place restrictions start to ease and
consumers start to get back out,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually in-store is beginning to take
share back away from curbside pickup,
[SPEAKER_01]: but delivery is maintaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now focusing on the
California consumer a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like a quick overview kind of
question, would you say that the market is
[SPEAKER_02]: up, down, or roughly where it was in
relation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look here, and actually let's
just kind of stay on California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see California for the most
part is where it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are however though, okay, look,
this is looking through the first few days
[SPEAKER_01]: of May, if you kind of look for similar
view, this is just daily transactions and
[SPEAKER_01]: average, not average transaction value,
but daily transactions, we are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, and you can't really count these two
data points at the beginning of May,
[SPEAKER_01]: but even further, I mean, until we're
mid-May now, so the last week or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have been seeing a slight return to
normal increase in sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we're starting to see more regular
cyclical weekly trending.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the general peaks on the Fridays,
right, before people go into the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So post paycheck and before they go into
the weekend, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see that come back to
normal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw our last Friday, the last real
Friday on March 20th, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when you started to have
abnormal slightly below average
[SPEAKER_01]: transactions taking place, right,
daily transactions taking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now coming into the first Friday of
May and second Friday of May, which I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have displayed here, but I can tell
you that we're starting to see normal
[SPEAKER_01]: weekly cyclical activity taking place
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that means that we can expect
things to be going somewhere back to
[SPEAKER_01]: normal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously a lot of this depends on when
people get their jobs back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes regionally, speaking
specifically to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's still a lot of question
marks around the timeline there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the biggest question really is around
the uncertainty around consumer spending,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how tight are their pockets going
to be and will they continue spending on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will they trade down either to lower
tiered or price products that like we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: over here, or will they leave the legal
market altogether, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also wondering, does your data tell
you about new people coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market, locked up people who are
like new to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, asking me shall receive two
seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually looking, let's look
specifically at California, but yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the questions I've been posing,
right, and now in terms of consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: research, right, we do semi-annually,
we do quantitative surveys asking the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers as well as the acceptors and
rejectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into that in a second about the
cannabis preferences, activities,
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption habits, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are currently in the field with our
sixth wave, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will be collecting information on
changes in consumer, among the acceptors
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we call them, but as a result of
this COVID-19 pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before I jump into discussing the
acceptor or what I like to call the new
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer or the consumer coming in,
let's just talk about the existing
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So benchmarking to other states,
we can see that when I'm looking here at
[SPEAKER_01]: the core older than California adult use
states, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that California still got a
ways to go, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: An opportunity to capture or increase its
consumer base, especially comparing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: say a Washington or an Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually in Oregon, Washington
actually is a little bit of a cunning
[SPEAKER_01]: state, but California, you did see a 60%
increase in percent of California
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers from 2017 to 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you benchmark that to Colorado,
Colorado saw 75% in consumers over that
[SPEAKER_01]: same time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we definitely do have, a nice
growth potential still in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: capturing additional consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we actually look out at this breakout
in California of the consumer acceptor
[SPEAKER_01]: reductor, now the consumer is,
these are folks that don't currently
[SPEAKER_01]: consume, but are open to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, the consumers, sorry, these are
folks that consume, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that purple segment in
California as we saw before slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The acceptor, these are the folks that
don't currently consume, but are open to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, call it your low-hanging fruit,
call it your untapped target market,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a significant portion of the
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is adults over 21 in California that
doesn't currently consume, but is waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: for somebody to tell them what to buy and
where to buy essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've been talking about this segment
for years, years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can probably, I'm sure Peter
remembers me talking about these acceptors
[SPEAKER_01]: from three, four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been long waiting for them to come
in and I am now, while we cannot speak to
[SPEAKER_01]: this in the data just yet, as like I said,
we're still in the field with the next
[SPEAKER_01]: wave of this survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that I have been seeing and
hearing, seeing and hearing from
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as anecdotally reported from my
friends, my cohort, that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers are now turning to cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To solve a lot of their COVID-19 problems,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're stuck at home with two kids,
drinking half a bottle of Chardonnay and I
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to make healthier choices for them
and their family and are turning to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I see Peter is sharing the
photo I shared with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now who told this person what to buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never, she actually, I've watched over the
last four years, evolved from a rejector
[SPEAKER_01]: to an acceptor and then an acceptor to a
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually that last evolution just took
place in the last few weeks, she called
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's your typical, I will refrain from
using her name, but she's your typical
[SPEAKER_01]: Chardonnay soccer mom, mid-30 year old
mother of two, Southern California
[SPEAKER_01]: disposable income and looking to
substitute her Chardonnay with healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here, let me, I'll reshare my
screen again, but this, my friend called
[SPEAKER_01]: me a couple of weeks ago and said,
tell me what to buy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave her a list of a bunch of
different products to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, mostly I stuck to low
dose, rapid onset, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of free rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wanted to give her the experience of a
different ingestion or intake methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can tell, she had no problem
dropping $180, $190, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was in one visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually, as we look at previous
slides with increased consumer spend or
[SPEAKER_01]: average transaction size increasing,
we could pose the question, is it existing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumers buying more lower
priced products, but at higher volume,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stocking up, or is it potentially some new
consumers also coming in and spending
[SPEAKER_01]: larger amounts, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this unnamed friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that remains to be seen, but I'm
actually gonna move quickly through this
[SPEAKER_01]: because I realized I've taken way more
time than I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's important to note here is that
we're seeing the total consumer plus
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptor base increasing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the total addressable market,
whether it be existing consumers or
[SPEAKER_01]: prospective consumers, is increasing in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And zooming through this really fast is a
summary of the 2019 California consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: with this fun little visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that consumer predominantly
skewed men, not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made up of a combo of Gen X and Gen Z
millennials, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mainly in that 25 to 55
demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 20% of consumers though are in that
boomerang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a 55 plus year old demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers per month spend about $135 on
average, up of about two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rarely use cannabis to relieve pain,
manage anxiety and sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their purchasing is predominantly
influenced by taste and flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is actually something that I noticed
sort of move up and down in terms of being
[SPEAKER_01]: number one purchase driver or purchase
influencer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has gone up in recent waves,
meaning consumers really do care about
[SPEAKER_01]: taste and flavor, which I will touch on in
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously price, but it's always
surprising to me to see taste and flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: have such an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking now at within, we're seeing
obviously trends within cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, mostly CBD products,
especially in the sublingual subcategory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distillates within the vape category
accounted for almost two thirds of sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top selling edible flavor was watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throwing out some quick highlights
here that I know I'm running through and
[SPEAKER_01]: not adding a lot of color, but I do just
wanna wrap this up again, giving you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: time to chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw constricts and flower each doing
about a billion dollars in sales in 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles almost half a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top three strains of 2019 were
Blue Dream, Durbin Poison and Sour
[SPEAKER_01]: Control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick question, any idea on how frequently
the average person shops, goes into a
[SPEAKER_00]: place once a week or once a month?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends, we have insights on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like 10 to 20% of consumers
shop the most frequent is once a month and
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about 10 to 20% of consumers
purchase about once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest bell curves from there into
weekly, daily and less than once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd have to pull those exact numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now looking though at 2019 in
aggregate, we can see that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth was, we saw 18% growth overall over
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that growth was driven by not
surprising the constricts, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: predominantly driven by vape category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still posing 22% growth year over year for
a massive category, which is very
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also seeing impressive growth
with smaller, more adult use oriented
[SPEAKER_01]: categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which isn't surprising as you look at the
image that Peter shared, what my friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: my anecdotal Chardonnay soccer mom
purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw her purchasing even though yes,
I told her to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw her purchasing easy to use,
low dose products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pre-rolls, I put that in the easy to
use, not necessarily low dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: but edibles, sublinguals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know that you would call
the nanos sublinguals, but I'd say the
[SPEAKER_01]: fast onset is what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants something that's accurate,
easy to dose and has an onset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now obviously as this new consumer
enters and has been entering, we have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: an evolution in the category mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, obviously we know vape has
been, or had historically been grabbing
[SPEAKER_01]: insane amounts of market share as a very
easy to use, discreet, rapid onset form of
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumption, however, in aftermath of vape
in the second half of 2019, we definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: saw vape take a little bit of a hit,
giving an opportunity obviously for other
[SPEAKER_01]: categories to continue to capture shares
such as edibles and sublinguals as we see
[SPEAKER_01]: here, but also, and pre-rolls,
excuse me, sorry, but also giving an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for flower to make a bit of a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just kind of wrapping up what we
just went through, we're going to see new
[SPEAKER_01]: markets continue to come online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in fact, I'm hearing specifically in
California, four major markets that make
[SPEAKER_01]: up up to about a million, and actually
Julie will probably speak better to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Julie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you pop in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think Anaheim, Concord, Fresno,
and another major California city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to be discussing putting ordinances
in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those four cities together make up about a
million people in a population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously having these additional
cities and additional access come online
[SPEAKER_01]: will be a huge boon to California
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue to see this new
consumer come in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And thus the consumer evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, you know, is now,
you know, we've seen this slow entrance of
[SPEAKER_01]: the new consumer, but is now going to be
the time is now going to be the real
[SPEAKER_01]: influx?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it finally, as cannabis has been deemed
an essential business nationwide,
[SPEAKER_01]: in most markets, is that really the stamp
of approval for that final
[SPEAKER_01]: destigmatization, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That final okay to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a safe and healthy alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, with that, you know,
we're going to see continued product
[SPEAKER_01]: development, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to address these new consumers who
expect a certain level of delivery in
[SPEAKER_01]: their product, whether it be an accurate
accuracy with regards to dosing or onset
[SPEAKER_01]: and offset, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even just packaging and delivery of the
consumer aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is this going to be the year,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen obviously this evolution across
a lot of product categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've been talking about beverages
for years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's been expecting that beverage
boom that we haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, along with that new consumer
starting to or continuing to come in,
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps at a more accelerated rate,
is 2020 going to finally be beverages this
[SPEAKER_01]: year, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With advancements in, you know,
onset offset technology and
[SPEAKER_01]: emulsification, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well, taste and flavor,
which we saw was very important to the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer, you know, especially in recent
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious to see where we evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just you know, posing some
questions for the group to discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that was useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
