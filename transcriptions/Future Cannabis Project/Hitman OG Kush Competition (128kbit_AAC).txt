[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me about the competition that's
coming up tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I just picked up the entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm truly, truly blessed to have this
opportunity to judge the OG competition
[SPEAKER_01]: put on by Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always doing it right and doing it
properly for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate what he's done since
day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of back and forth on the
internet, but all in all, I love what
[SPEAKER_01]: Dougie's done for our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been there since day one,
long side, and I love what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this OG competition is going to be
super, super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for me, I grew up smoking OG
Kush, and for, I feel like, eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: nine years straight, that's all I smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure clone only OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dougie's kind of brought this thing
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so talk about OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the lineage and history of,
because I'm actually sitting down with
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh D.
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of stories,
and actually that's one of the guys that I
[SPEAKER_01]: look up to, Josh D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really respect his opinion, and I follow
that trend and that story, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different stories about
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that OG stands for original.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that thought that
it stood for ocean grown or original
[SPEAKER_01]: gangsta and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always told from day one that the OG
in OG Kush stood for original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then talking to a lot of my friends,
from that generation, the Kush part was
[SPEAKER_01]: due to the kushy nature, the squishy
nature of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what stuck, as far as
I've been told, about OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lineage is all over the place,
because nobody created OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that some of the first OG,
that true, true clone only strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: came out of Florida, migrated to LA,
and really gained its popularity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and its hype in Southern California,
and then dispersed from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One cut went out to Ghost OG out in
Oregon, and things spread like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some cool studies are coming out with
the genealogy and following the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: origins of strains like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through and through, since day one,
the high of OG Kush has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely strong, but clear headed for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the taste is just something almost
undescribable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say it's got a citrus,
gas, and tennis ball funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say tennis ball, because if you've
ever cracked a brand new can of tennis
[SPEAKER_01]: balls, smell that smell, and then smell a
jar of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some similarities there,
oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So citrus, gas, and tennis ball funk is
what I consider OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also a lot of OGs,
and especially some of the original ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: that do have a hint of anise on the back
end, and on the top of the tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of all those flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citrus, gas, anise, and tennis ball funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Hitman OG competition,
everybody grew OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might not have been the same exact
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not all have grown clone only
OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't even fully dove into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got it late last night, and just
starting to dig in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your judge's tapas variety
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to start out with number
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to make a big list for myself,
write everything down, and put things into
[SPEAKER_01]: the app.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I always start just
sequentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is number one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going to first,
smell it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, first I want to smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the sunglasses off.
[SPEAKER_01]: First I smell it, take it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what the nug structure looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that there's no issues
that are blatant to the eye, to the naked
[SPEAKER_01]: eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that there's no PM or mite
damage, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which generally speaking, in most of these
cups recently, you're not going to see too
[SPEAKER_01]: much of it, because it's going to get
pushed aside, or not actually fully
[SPEAKER_01]: entered, due to failing of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I go for the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to break one of the nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to really get deep inside there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I basically break one up,
and I roll a spliff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can't really tell anything fully
from just the smell and the appearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the smokability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about how it burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the flavor fully through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually will smoke every single
entry from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain entries, you know, you get halfway
through the spliff, and it's just really
[SPEAKER_01]: not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll set those down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll kind of notice in my ashtray
that some of the spliffs are burned to the
[SPEAKER_01]: crutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them definitely have a big spliff
tail, as we call it, left behind,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I didn't like it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the initial reaction to entry
number one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Entry number one smells great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a great structure, big calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, oftentimes I'll look,
too, to see if the bud looks like it was
[SPEAKER_01]: machine trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this does not appear so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll see if the calyxes have
been knocked off with some scissors and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, if people weren't as
particular with the trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a nice, tight trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big calyx structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful trichome coverage for an OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a great cure on it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good OG nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little something else on the
tip of my tongue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to have to taste it to
really, really fully see what I think
[SPEAKER_01]: about this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally, I'll go through them all and
just do a visual and smell inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I'll start at the
very beginning again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the same visual and smell inspection,
and then smoke a spliff of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke spliffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to really see a constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I do differently
than a lot of the judges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know the flavor that I'm really
looking for when I blend my grabba in with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use a blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use a bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoke out of a bong, all I taste is
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that are used to smoking
bongs, they're using that resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a resin taste that's kind of always
on the back end of their tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're able to taste the flavor of
the cannabis that much clearer because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're balancing it off of something
that's a standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, that standard is an unbleached
paper and some grabba.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what I base my judging
off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll roll a spliff because I smoke spliffs
daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for each.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many entries do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: For this one, we have 10 entries,
10 passing entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so how and we'll get to the passing
part because that was a big big Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: kerfuffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how long will it take you to go
through all 10?
[SPEAKER_00]: To give each one a fair because if you're
super high after one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm you know, maybe it's that I'm blessed
to smoke really good, but I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: judging so many cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a pretty healthy habit of smoking
upwards of an ounce, ounce and a half an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do get high and some strains
definitely hit me a lot stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try and space them out at least a couple
of hours, but I can knock out 10 entries
[SPEAKER_01]: in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a day's all in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I've had upwards of 75 entries
in four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about passing versus
failing because people were throwing heat
[SPEAKER_00]: at Doug for not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sunglasses back on for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of entrants failed the testing
and Doug very in my mind, very openly let
[SPEAKER_00]: people know that on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's pretty transparent with the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he got a lot of shit for it because
he wasn't calling those people out by
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've seen from an outside
perspective, because I've judged fuck a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand cups at this point, to be honest,
I've judged a lot of cannabis cups and I
[SPEAKER_01]: love the transparency, but you can only
really be transparent to a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of friends and community in
this that it's such a hard situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting your friends on blast and things
of that nature is not what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to promote positivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the time these guys are getting
cuts from outside sources that have
[SPEAKER_01]: systemic problems with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how a lot of these things are
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that they're spraying with
Michael butanol still and things of that
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, it's not really my place
to speak on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the reasons I don't throw
competitions because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got too many friends in this industry
and, you know, it's a balancing act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
