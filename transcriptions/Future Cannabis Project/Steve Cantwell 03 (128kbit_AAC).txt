[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make sure that your product is
as easy to sell on the back end as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: on the front end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, if the purchasing managers
at these stores don't want to buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: product, I don't care how cool a logo you
have, what kind of catch phrases you run,
[SPEAKER_00]: how good your branding, your this or that
is, they're not going to blackball you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to want to deal with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make it a pain in the ass every
time you show up to their store,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes fucking three hours to take your
order in with all the metric systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what, dude, it only takes this
dude a half hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in and they're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing to do when he's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go with that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if he grows fucking meds and you grow
the best weed in the world, that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely one thing you want to
focus on is making sure that your whole
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, you're not just growing the
best cannabis, but you also have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good sales team, have a really good
marketing team, and you have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: complete picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a different breed out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market nowadays, I mean, you have good
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a grow team that does nothing but
grow the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have geneticists and they have
all the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a sales team that does
nothing but sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a marketing team that does
nothing but sit on Instagram all day,
[SPEAKER_00]: posting ads and writing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to compete with that if you
want to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really do got to focus and really
hit it on all points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can't just have OG Kush and
grow on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just have OG Kush and grow on it
really good and expect to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be good at every aspect of the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you got to embrace is the
state, the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be successful, you have to
play ball to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys in California are going
through some things now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, it will weed some
people out early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can just get through it,
it'll get easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Nevada, the rules and the
regulations, like even with branding,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a product called Baby J's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran it for two years and they told us
that you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations are too strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby J's is slang.
[SPEAKER_00]: J's is slang.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to completely rebrand our brand
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I didn't want to
spend 50 grand arguing with the state in
[SPEAKER_00]: court and making them wrong and proving
them wrong and all these things because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not going to help my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to help my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to waste time in the wrong
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be able to pick your battles with the
state regulations and things like that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is a time to stand up to them,
like microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on every phone call I could for the
longest time about microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbial testing was a joke for the
longest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't voice your opinion,
it will continue to help the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example, synthetic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't worry about microbials like I
worry about microbial because I use
[SPEAKER_00]: microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, we had a total aerobic
count that they tested for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means anything that grows on that
plant, you will fail for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something you'd want to argue
the state about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just pick your battles with that
because, again, there's going to be lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many things that are wrong
with the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just go in there guns blazing
every single day trying to make what's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong right overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so extremely competitive market,
tons of brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you guys are going
to see going on here very shortly is that
[SPEAKER_00]: brands will start to get bought out and
start to consolidate and all these cool
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see that happening,
getting bought out and all these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you, it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just make sure you be careful who you
partner with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Co-ops here, you guys have a history of
co-ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Co-ops can work if they're written down
correctly and properly placed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can get a lot of strength by
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely recommend that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just make sure that you're not getting
into business and building a brand with
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong people because that's one of the
biggest things that could really take down
[SPEAKER_00]: a partnership to, I'm sorry, a company to
is part getting into bed with the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure to try to build a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to build a brand with people
that stand for what you stand for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, if you're trying to build a
brand around the regenerative movement and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got somebody who's trying to build
a brand around they don't care,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just want the green rush money,
it's not always going to jive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure you pick a good team
that can stay in their lane and back you
[SPEAKER_00]: up where you need to be backed up and not
try to run the ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blessed in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four general contractors with my
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know nothing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good old country boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work 12 hour days and they're all in
their 60s and they still work 12 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they trusted me to build their brand,
to build their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stay in their lane for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen other companies that all the
tools in the world for success,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no reason they can't be successful
except for people that know how to stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: their lane, people that know how to stick
to their strengths and it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just basically ride it out from the
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, you guys in California,
you guys are going through a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you guys have more farms,
more people that know how to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: than probably anywhere in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a good brand, having a good
story behind your brand is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't have something,
again, you're just a white label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody can grow Blue Dream,
anybody can grow OG Kush, anybody can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout Cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to make sure that
you're putting your name not just on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, not just on the grow method,
but on the whole package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you buy a GLP, you're not just
buying a no-till-living organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just buying LED grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just buying any one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're buying a no-till-living organic LED
grown, properly cured, good packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product, you can guarantee it's going to
be what you want it to be every single
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits on all points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what you have to be at
this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not cropping out at freaking 100
acres, if you don't have freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: Coca-Cola as an investor, trust me,
you want to take a small niche organic
[SPEAKER_00]: market and that's what's going to save you
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I assure you, all these big
corporate farms that do have that
[SPEAKER_00]: Coca-Cola backing at that 100 million
acres of light-depth, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking state-of-the-art greenhouses,
trust me, they're not thinking like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thinking, how do I make the most
money?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get the cheapest deal on rock
wool?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I mix my own nutrients so I don't
have to buy them from somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just make my own and dump them
down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not even thinking about
attacking the regenerative organic side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like you have a couple of small
people that will try and I hope they are
[SPEAKER_00]: successful because we need more to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's really the
only saving grace for the small farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmer that doesn't have the
billionaires behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years ago, I thought everybody was
going to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super nervous and I was like,
man, I didn't want to show nothing on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought everybody and their mom would be
flocking to this aisle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started cropping out and we started
doing our branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody started branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nevada, nobody had branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody started chasing our branding and
trying to follow our branding ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody tried touching our soil as
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really blew my mind that nobody was
trying to clean organic soil indoors or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it just shows that nobody wants
to even attempt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like my safe spot that I thought it
wasn't and it completely was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It scared the big money investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you tell them that you grow weed
with bugs in a state that does microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, they didn't give me money for
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably say at four years,
we'd probably have about, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% success rate failures, fail pass?
[SPEAKER_00]: 85% fail success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, that was the first
startup year, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know about indoor dehumification
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got to ask for jails now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my guy doing, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, so a lot of things to watch out
for, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know that when you're building a
brand, it's not one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's a million things you've got
to be able to hit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a good driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a good car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a good pit crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a good manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a whole thing running
really smooth and efficiently if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be competitive and important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, I'll plan it when I get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, that, willy nilly, you've really got
to be on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And data is your best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this new age, in this new industry,
there's so much data out there that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: now, for the first time, start to collect
and actually make sense of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you want to be successful,
really look to data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably say one of my biggest leaks,
we were just talking about this just the
[SPEAKER_00]: other day in our grow, it wasn't,
okay, I used this nutrient liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I did this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we actually looked at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this drain tests the most,
which therefore makes the most money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This drain yields the most, which then
obviously makes the most money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started weeding out the ones that
don't yield, don't test high, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started structuring our grow more
based off of the data that we were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I know how to plant my room to hit
certain target yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I've got to make
sure I hit certain, I can't grow five
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of a 10% strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta grow, I'd rather grow five pounds
of a 30% strain than 20 pounds of a 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing your strengths, knowing what to
plant, when to plant, is gonna be key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of data out there with
this new age of testing, with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations that the state makes you go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, you can flip them,
it's all good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making you take good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they're making you share it
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's good data,
it's useful, and you can use it to build
[SPEAKER_00]: your brand to make your company stronger,
to make things better and more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely utilize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to, a lot of people will
just, will bark at it like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a chore, oh, it's a burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it like that, your whole
business is gonna be a burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything about what you do is gonna be a
burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The love of growing a plant is gonna die,
and you'll hate what you do every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So versus finding it, I recommend
embracing some of the things that is best
[SPEAKER_00]: you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so again, what we did in Nevada,
we were blessed, and we were one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys up here aren't,
don't have that luxury of being first to
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just heard Jonathan say you guys
just got some of your first ordinances
[SPEAKER_00]: passed or something like that,
so you guys can finally start to grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: here, up here, up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, it's gonna be
even more harder for you guys because now
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are stepping into an arena full
of people and it's hard to get your voice
[SPEAKER_00]: heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I recommend doing things right,
doing things that you know greedy people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't even gonna think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just what's best for the
planet, what's best for the patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's best for the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking like that, if you're
thinking regenerative, you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive advantage already because
again, the 99% of who you're up against
[SPEAKER_00]: ain't thinking like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, guys, I'm pretty much out
of words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
