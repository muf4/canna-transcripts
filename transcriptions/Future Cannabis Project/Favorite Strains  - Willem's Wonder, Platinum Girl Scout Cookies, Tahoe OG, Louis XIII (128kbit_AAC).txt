[SPEAKER_02]: When you were first growing in Michigan
and you were first growing up in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_02]: what were the genetics that you came into
that you were just like, this is amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: and who gave it to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the history?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Michigan, so yours is gonna be
like, mine are gonna be wacky names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's Williams Wonder was my baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell us about Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you describe the plant,
like the feno characteristics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how true it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told that Williams Wonder is like an
indoor only strain because it has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: flowered under 12 and 12 and it won't
start outdoor fast enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I was in Michigan and it
didn't matter, but it was like a super
[SPEAKER_01]: strong Lysol and it wasn't leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had really big leaves and then one day
you'd walk in and all of your plants would
[SPEAKER_01]: be hanging over because they would just
plump up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really fast, really quick and
like low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that with super silver haze as just
a good strong thing that was gonna deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with mold because I was a new grower and I
needed something to be mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for years I grew just a few
strains, Platinum Girl Scout Cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was Platinum OG Girl Scout Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was bonkers, just the most fire,
just well, every bud was just beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was always dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grew that strain, it was like
dropping little rocks in your bucket when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OGs and stuff are a little bit
lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew the Platinum Cookie Strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew Tahoe OG, a cut of Tahoe OG,
Louis the 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG 18, but that didn't work out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are my three strains,
the Tahoe, Louis and Cookies, which were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I grew things that I knew people
liked and I liked myself and those strains
[SPEAKER_00]: were all fire, pretty heavy indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love Louis and Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still two of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Limonene and Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tahoe was so pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just smell this citrus coming
off that plant with that fuel underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they grew so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly formed colas, chunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Louis had that awesome crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They purple out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember they had that whole greenhouse
purple out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the Platinum Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Platinum would just get a little cold
at night and they would just go and just
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into these beautiful, shiny purple
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The density of a baseball, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, that's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!
