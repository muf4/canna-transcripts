[SPEAKER_05]: How's everyone doing today?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll start out and have everyone
introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Taylor, T.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beasel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do the solventless Viking Company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also do Little Lake Valley Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'll introduce everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Alice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a bunch of hash with Flynn under
Wooksauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also an educator throughout a
company I own called Girls and Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bring a different Brazil
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Flynn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do Wooksauce Winery and then also
fully melted at Southern Hub.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Todd, Resident Ranch Extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, like these guys, I do
non-solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of Nevada County these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we'll start out and ask our
panelists here about how they go about
[SPEAKER_05]: selecting their plants for solventless and
how they go about in the garden choosing
[SPEAKER_05]: the right plants, like when they're
phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Flynn, why don't you start us up?
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I guess like the first box that
always needs to be checked with like
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that I personally am looking for,
phenohunting and stuff, is like turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm looking for something that has
like at the end of the day is amazing when
[SPEAKER_03]: it's growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we all know sometimes when you are
smelling a plant growing and then you go
[SPEAKER_03]: to hash it, you get a very different
version of things and maybe not what you
[SPEAKER_03]: expected and sometimes you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, it's about turps first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end of the day,
like resin per square foot because you got
[SPEAKER_03]: to make things work from, you know,
I guess commercial perspective from a
[SPEAKER_03]: business point of view and things like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're doing that at that level,
that's definitely a perspective you kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of always need to take into account.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of the next thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first thing is something unique
and something that I haven't seen before
[SPEAKER_03]: and something that I'm, you know,
stoked on myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess is someone that, you know,
sees a decent amount of hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we have Marley introduce
himself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Marley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live and direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Middletown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank everybody for coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Marley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do congenital extracts and big shout out
to Humble Local and Joey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Tamara for putting this on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having something like this in the
community and we all love good hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so super awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm just a local here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just grow hash and grow weed
and make hash and, you know, keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my brother does a little farming,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collab and yeah, just all about putting
out some good products for people to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Doug.
[SPEAKER_05]: About your selection on the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you start out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, boy, that's a tricky question for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow it and fucking send it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon my French.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send it through the wash and see what we
get on the other end.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Flynn Flynn covered a lot of it
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: These days, specifically more than
anything, it's the turps, everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing we're looking for is
something, yes, that is unique,
[SPEAKER_04]: that pops out flavor wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not looking for, you know,
the same run of the mill stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else has.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, particularly, I'm kind of on a
little bit different trip these days to
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of go back and find older flavors
that I remember from when I was younger
[SPEAKER_04]: that I smoked in high school that I loved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, Sauer D's making this
comeback.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of my favorite favorites,
cushions, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the selection note, yes,
turps first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that I started to focus more
on personally is the plant structure
[SPEAKER_04]: itself, too, and things that are hardy,
because in the past I have selected things
[SPEAKER_04]: basically just off the turps and how it
washed and not the plant structure or the
[SPEAKER_04]: hardiness of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after a few years of growing those
things and having them in the mix with
[SPEAKER_04]: other plants, it tends to just sometimes
bring problems that I just don't need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, some plants will be way more
susceptible to pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might make great hash, but the
structure on the plant sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs a shit ton of support.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of grows like crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It likes to get pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, after a few years of working
with that kind of stuff, I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: moving on from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And focusing a little bit more towards the
turps and the plant structure and the
[SPEAKER_04]: hardiness of the plant itself versus just,
is this good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I also want to be able to give
that, possibly give those genetics to
[SPEAKER_04]: other people and them have success with it
and it not be a finicky pain in the ass
[SPEAKER_04]: that everybody just ends up having
problems with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, that could probably go on
for days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marley, we're asking the panelists to talk
about how they go about first selecting
[SPEAKER_05]: plants, where they even want to go about
starting to make the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, where do you start out in the garden
for looking at plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we're starting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go basically for stuff that I want to
smoke personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to bring the flavors that I see out
there and bring them to people who might
[SPEAKER_02]: not have access.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just kind of go for seeds mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll run some clones if I find a nice cut
of something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like there's just a lot of
diversity in the seeds and a lot of vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's usually how I like to start out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with the seeds and make some good
selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: The structure is a huge thing for me too,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's popping a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to have some plants that are
just kind of weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of try to cool those off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'll select for potency and
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the turps, but I got to have
that potency too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking a lot of turp heavy stuff lately
has definitely made me like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to run something that's high
potency that's just going to hit me nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to select for that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now what about a resin structure?
[SPEAKER_05]: So after you guys have, obviously most of
you are selecting for terpenes at first,
[SPEAKER_05]: structure, those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after you find the plant that has the
terpenes and has the structure,
[SPEAKER_05]: how are you going about selecting the
plant that you even want to test wash?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what signifies to you something that
you can observe and you're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, okay, I actually want to test wash
this plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Compared to something you're like,
yeah, I don't even have to test wash this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, shit, I'll go first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I was just thinking to
myself, is we didn't even get into the
[SPEAKER_04]: resin when selecting these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be totally honest and say
that these days, the things I used to
[SPEAKER_04]: think and I used to look for, I've been
thrown for a loop so many times the last
[SPEAKER_06]: two seasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been thrown for a loop so many times
the last two seasons with doing the like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Touch the buds, see how stringy it is,
how sandy the resin is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it super sticky?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like the cherry pie that you touch
it and your fingers literally just wet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously that's something, forget about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant is not going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's up with this mic,
but can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm a stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You touch it, you just see it on your
finger, it's just wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where other things like, we were just
talking about cookies and cream,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I'm going to use that for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You touch that and you can literally see
the head's hole just sitting on your
[SPEAKER_04]: finger like little marbles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like sand between your fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's obviously, that's going to wash
usually pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I've ran into a few in the last
two seasons that I touched that are uber
[SPEAKER_04]: grease and still washed well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm at the point when it comes to the
actual resin, I send it through a jar,
[SPEAKER_04]: I do the jar test, which I'm sure a lot of
you people have seen and Adam does the
[SPEAKER_04]: resin dial now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get a visual representation of what- For
those that may not know what a jar test
[SPEAKER_05]: is, could you- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take a large mason jar, and I
specifically use 20 grams of fresh weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will throw the weed in there,
the ice, a little water, let that sit in
[SPEAKER_04]: the freezer for five or 10 minutes just to
get everything to the same temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll shake that for 10 minutes,
and then we will just let that sit and
[SPEAKER_04]: settle for a half hour or so and see what
settles to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then work it to the corner, let it settle
to the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: After doing that a bunch of times and then
washing that material, you start to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to get a visual picture of,
okay, this is about 3% or this is about
[SPEAKER_04]: 5%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use 20 grams because visually,
we all know what about a gram looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a gram on 20 grams, then that's a
5% return, which you're killing it then.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always a really good sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do the jar test just to see what is
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm still a fan of doing a larger test
wash batch, like maybe 2,000 wet grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do the jar test first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would prefer to always do a test wash,
but these days, I'm just committed to the
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it does a decent jar test, we send it
and we wash it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we get a full representation of what
is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, the jar test doesn't tell
you if it's a sticky bag strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is just going to stick to your bags
and dunk everything up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The selecting the plants just off of feel,
I've gotten away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do use a microscope, not so much to
check the color, but to check the
[SPEAKER_04]: structure of the trichome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a long stalk with a big head or is
it a really short stalk with a small head?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're generally looking for a little bit
of a longer stalk with a big fat head on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually those will fall off pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much of a stalk, sometimes you end up
with a lot of stalk in your hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to start rambling here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've personally gotten away from the
touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have really a straight answer to
that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's just committing to this is
what I do and I'm going to wash this
[SPEAKER_04]: anyhow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good or bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing like you were talking about
with the finger feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably my main indicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just feeling how it feels on your fingers
if it's sticky, if it's sandy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, the oily ones, you can just
tell right off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost feels like you touched some type
of canola oil or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's my first indicator of
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be hard to wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the second thing I look for
when popping a pack of seeds and doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt through a pack is just the ones
without any turps at all because sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll get all the way through the cycle
flowered to plant out and it still doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really have strong turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to cull those ones pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to mix the phenos into a
wash, I'd like to cull the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: turpless.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't affect the quality of the rest
of the wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mainly how I select.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say honestly I agree with Todd a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've moved away a lot from the hand feel
stuff just because I feel like I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: proven wrong a lot of times on things that
I thought one thing and then the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: opposite thing happened compared to what
the hand feel or even sometimes a
[SPEAKER_03]: microscope told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the times, it's surprising too.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start to measure resin per square
foot, some of those two percenters,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on if they're really putting out
a lot of fresh, frozen weight and flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it's greasy, even though it's
hard to work with, like Smarties for
[SPEAKER_03]: example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our example for explaining this always is
struggle to hit two and a quarter percent
[SPEAKER_03]: with that strain even if you crush growing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the greasiest, most annoying fucking
resin to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is crazy good.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people really like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of those things that's just
like you don't see that type of like blue
[SPEAKER_03]: candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys have had like blue diesel and
stuff from Oregon or no like Kush for
[SPEAKER_03]: breakfast genetics, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a very unique terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like a funny thing that we figured
out what the Smarties do is like starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to wash strains together, which is
something that we would not do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Smarties was so annoying and
so much from it would stay in the bag that
[SPEAKER_01]: we started using the super dry resin like
the cookies and cream that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing to wash together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we started washing together,
all that resin was falling in the bag and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was not sticking to the bag anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was... Or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it would just like make like get the
bag stuck, you know, and then you could
[SPEAKER_01]: work easier with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was actually a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: To have that cookies and cream on the side
and make sure you get actually better
[SPEAKER_01]: yields and can work with that material
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'll say sticky strains are very
frustrating because they do all the hard
[SPEAKER_01]: work to grow it and you pay the power
bill, depending if you do it indoor or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of that is in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes to the IZO that you clean
your bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you... I'm on a thing this year of
purposely washing the sticky strains that
[SPEAKER_04]: most people hate because I personally
think those usually make the terpiest and
[SPEAKER_04]: best hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy every time like the Smarties,
it only hits two percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in a way, it's worth growing because
it throws down on the flour weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even though like cookies and cream,
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hits five percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you do the numbers like on a per
square foot basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually like very neck and neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason the cookies and cream
comes out on top is because it puts out
[SPEAKER_03]: more melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hard to get melt out of the
Smarties above like the 90 bag,
[SPEAKER_03]: whereas the cookies and cream has like 90
up to 150 bags sometimes putting out like
[SPEAKER_05]: 45 melts in cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just one of those strains that
has like very clean dry resin that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get a like very clean melt from.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it puts out like half the wet weight
of the Smarties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though it does like more hash in a
way, it's way worth it to run Smarties and
[SPEAKER_03]: way more than you would think if you're
maybe not the grower or you don't look
[SPEAKER_03]: back and understand like resin per square
foot yields and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely ends up being a little more
on the production side of like washing and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're a cultivator and you take
like multiple months to grow something,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's very much less a factor that you're
thinking about a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what about the, you know,
story of the ages right now, fresh press
[SPEAKER_05]: to cold cure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have certain strains that you
have practice on and you feel that the
[SPEAKER_05]: bouquet of the strain has brought out more
in a fresh press or more in a cold cure?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you guys, you know, just have
strictly, you know, certain things you do,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I only do fresh press, it cures on
its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain strains that you only do cold cure
on, like those sort of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cold cure versus fresh press debate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like the skiers versus
snowboarder debate back in the day to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to, I'll be totally honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to hate cold cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that it was just a way for a lot
of people to hide stuff, this,
[SPEAKER_04]: that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a fresh press guy working with more
cold cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to be honest, this guy here
listening to one of his interviews and him
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about cold cure and certain
strains, you bring more out with the cure
[SPEAKER_04]: than leaving it fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where there are strains that I personally
think aren't necessarily left better
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh, but are suitable for fresh press.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some strains are just, it's kind of too
potent and too spicy in fresh press.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the market doesn't really like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of fresh press doesn't have a
nose to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the market doesn't like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me specifically, if it's got a good
nose in fresh press, and it's a strain
[SPEAKER_04]: that doesn't want to butter super fast,
I will put a little bit of it out in fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: press.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd ever do anything just all fresh press.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I will do stuff all cold cure,
but I usually will only a couple strains
[SPEAKER_04]: pull out a little bit of fresh press to do
because I just got thinking about it more
[SPEAKER_04]: and really looking into it more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to agree with Taylor down there
that a lot of strains end up better after
[SPEAKER_04]: the cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can bring out more flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a little bit of a deeper flavor,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's where I'm at on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fresh press.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it definitely does happen where a lot
of stuff isn't as loud on the nose in
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh press.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't say that necessarily there's
ones that I like better in one or the
[SPEAKER_02]: other as far as the nose goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as some strains in fresh press
just don't have the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's ones that when they do really
smell good, then it's a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like putting out more, too,
just because I feel like it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: saturated on the market right now,
the cold cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just feel like offering another
option is nice for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can kind of experience just
the complexities of the rosin as it
[SPEAKER_02]: changes from fresh press to cold cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love stuff in cold cure,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both just, we all love rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one other thing to say on that that
he made me think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are certain strains that I wouldn't
even cold cure going forward, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hunting this new 24K cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the old one that I have is super
terpy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of can't beat it if you like
orange citrus.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it cures out so dry, no matter what
you do to it, you can't get that nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: wet batter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the market hates that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the 24K, that cut in particular,
I think is way better represented in fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: press because it doesn't have that dry,
cakey cold cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a really good nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I don't like about it is
that it tends to butter fast, which is why
[SPEAKER_04]: it dries out when it cold cures.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's one strain specifically for me
that going forward, if I keep running that
[SPEAKER_04]: Fino, it's just going to be to do fresh
press with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say I think it depends on,
at the end of the day, the person who's
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe purchasing it, what they would want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think things can be represented well in
both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely agree that some
strains, for whatever reason, when you do
[SPEAKER_03]: the cold cure, it definitely adds another
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, a more enjoyable experience,
maybe, versus some strains in fresh press.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say that cold cure is a little
bit more accessible for some people,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially that maybe are just coming into
the solventless market and maybe don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have maybe the education behind how to
treat a fresh press so that they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: good experience consuming it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some people will buy a fresh press
and maybe not understand, once it gets to
[SPEAKER_03]: a certain stage, how to whip it into a
batter to not get that dry, crumbly
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of gives those dry caustic dabs
on your throat, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar things can happen with full melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: People who don't understand, got to keep
it in the freezer, basically, to keep it
[SPEAKER_03]: nice or to keep it out for a couple days,
unless you're going to smoke it pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly, this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of it can come down to that type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Customer education around different types
of products and how to treat them and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say I really like a good fresh
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it comes out and adds a
different level of turf and definitely a
[SPEAKER_03]: different, on a lot of strains,
you get a different look depending on if
[SPEAKER_03]: you cold cure or if you fresh press it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, I feel like we put out a
lot of cold cure too because a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that would tend toward the fresh
press would actually really also tend
[SPEAKER_03]: toward full melt hash, which we do a lot
of as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of allows a lot of the people
who would want fresh press really would
[SPEAKER_03]: also probably prefer hash anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to go for a full melt
like preserved resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they covered everything,
so I'll keep it as personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from the traditional hash world,
so I thought I was going to be a fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: press person and I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like cold cure more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most of the cultivars, unless they get
super dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they start getting super dry,
I spliff it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spliff it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had this jar of ziline, that was
traveling with me for a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a full jar, like a full five
gram jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always my to go when I need
something to calm it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I literally traveled with it for three
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the third month, it just kept
getting better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hardly ever see that with all
the fresh frozen material we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was doing more like traditional
hash world, yeah, the cure and the aging
[SPEAKER_01]: was something more special.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll say that I'll keep with the cold
cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's something fresh,
I'll choose the hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, and how about we finish off and talk
about maybe something new, exciting you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys have found this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: A new strain you guys are really excited
about, something you're really hopeful
[SPEAKER_05]: for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe something you haven't washed yet,
you got still frozen and you're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, this is going to be the one.
I've got to think for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually most excited to see something
from two different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is Todd.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grew the bop gun number seven selection
from me that I chose from a seed pheno
[SPEAKER_03]: hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also Enzo, who is 420nomad707,
who we work with quite a bit on the wook
[SPEAKER_03]: sauce collaboration stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they both grew it and they're both in
like very different micro climates because
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd's in Grass Valley where it's super
hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's right in Sonoma County where it's
like very cold and wet for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually super interested to see
like the differences and how it came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they both approach cultivation
from a very like similar ethos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I definitely am excited for
that for me this year because we took a
[SPEAKER_03]: break from growing this last year after
having some civil fine difficulties,
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited about the Z cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that one out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody tried it,
but I really like the Z cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Z to Sunday driver to cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one's from Finest Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I like that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really stable in the fresh press.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, it's been going on like almost
five, six days in the fresh press.
[SPEAKER_02]: That room temp, but it's pretty,
you know, it's pretty cold in the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm really excited for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did five and a half percent to
hash and and a lot of it came out nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: melty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that cultivar a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'll probably keep it
around and keep working with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pancakes is coming back next year for
anybody who got to like the pancakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting momed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the whole veg space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of a hard one for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm smoking on it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're calling it three way Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get it straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem Valley Kush by Pure Kush by
Strawberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: From seeds I got at Area 101 Seed Swap
probably in like 2017, maybe 2018 from
[SPEAKER_04]: some old guy up on Spyrock.
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea who the guy is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who the guy was, but it had
chem in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take some and honestly put those in
the ground, not even knowing what to
[SPEAKER_04]: expect, not really thinking that I would
get anything that special from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The the flower is way different than the
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hash to me came out like that sweet
bakery Kush that Kush can get sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like it had sex with a chemical
factory or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like to me, it's like right up my
alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody today said it smelled kind of
like cat piss, which sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of totally into.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, like it was a total surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of like for me
personally, the one out of the garden this
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But things I'm most excited about probably
I popped a bunch of Z by Chem Dog from
[SPEAKER_04]: Skunk Tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty hopeful on those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to find something really gassy
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's that's kind of my trip right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring that gas back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have any questions for any of
the panelists?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you had a bunch of questions for
Todd.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have one question.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I see a lot of people post like 150 and
like the 120U like belt that's like just
[SPEAKER_08]: mad clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, super clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I watched a lot of outdoor material.
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously you're not pulling like the
cleanest like 150U heads and things like
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what are these guys doing to get such
clean like big heads?
[SPEAKER_04]: From outdoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean 150 like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I rarely see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very strain specific, I will say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we keep going back to cookies and
cream.
[SPEAKER_08]: 120U, like how did some of these guys get
like such clean 120U even outside?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for me, it's I just preach dust
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I don't do like a pre-rinse or
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't found it to be super effective
with fresh frozen, though I have maybe a
[SPEAKER_04]: different tactic of doing it if I did it
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard I have heard and I haven't
tried it myself of people running double
[SPEAKER_04]: bags running like a 2150.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff is going to get through.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the other thing you can do to
like clean up the 120 on outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't spray the 150.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like don't touch the bag and whatever
120 and stuff that gets caught up in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but I you know, we're pretty
anal about how clean that we can get it
[SPEAKER_04]: from the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can only get it so clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, you know, the 120 it's it's
hard to get it like melt quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean on the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard kind of no matter what
you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I will run the 120,
the 104 bag and the 90 bag and usually
[SPEAKER_04]: just put the 90 out as melt, which you
don't have a fat pole.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that 104 really will clean the 90 up a
lot, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep going back to cookies and cream
just because it's it's just the hash
[SPEAKER_04]: monster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen it do things I haven't seen
other strains do like pull clean 150U on
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't I wouldn't say it was clean
enough to put out as melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I know what you're talking
about, the 150.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I would say the same thing on
that personally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one of these guys has a trick for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me learn something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little trick for the 150 because I
haven't been big on the 120, 150U for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have just kind of I realized that
part of it was the bags that I was using.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some bags that I don't know if
maybe the Micron was something wrong with
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the 120.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just wasn't pulling and I switched
brands and it started pulling a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: in the 120.
[SPEAKER_08]: But can I ask what specific brands?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the ones that I'm using now are the
bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble bags 120U is pulling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing that I noticed
was what were you using before?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have nothing bad to say about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just noticed, you know, I tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would also say light diffused
greenhouse cloth or plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been using cloth that's even
more diffused than this right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this is like I don't know what
it was, maybe 30 percent or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like I do like a 50 percent
diffused cloth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that just gives better
protection to the trichomes and makes the
[SPEAKER_02]: heads be able to get bigger maybe because
of less, you know, less strength from the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun beating down on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that with the greenhouse is also from
the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that correlates,
but I've just noticed that since like in
[SPEAKER_02]: the spring too, I ran like totally clear
hoop houses and then my brother ran all
[SPEAKER_02]: light diffused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed his definitely yielded more
in the 120 and was less of a stable gland
[SPEAKER_02]: around the trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the outside of the trichome
was more strong on the totally clear hoops
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the light diffused ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fresh press from that just kind of
melted into cold cure without much
[SPEAKER_02]: agitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say the light diffused is a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm definitely going to be running all
that from now on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light diffused cloth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_02]: A preach shade for Hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like a strawberry kind of cloth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cloth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's almost white.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like pretty diffused.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say anecdotally this year,
ABR, a farmer we work with at Wixos a lot,
[SPEAKER_03]: he moved farms actually just slightly,
just like one property up the hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, one of the plots is a lot
shadier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found like the berry crunch,
like the cleanest resin I think I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: from like depths or personally that I've
produced at least from depths or stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've produced from depths and stuff
has been just incredibly clean resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's clean in some of the stuff we've
made from our indoor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like incredible, which I usually
don't see from a lot of at least depths
[SPEAKER_03]: and full sun, full season.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very hard to produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like good full melt in the 150 full sun,
full season is going to come a lot down to
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics and then having the right
seasonals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like so many things you can't control.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the coming together of,
you know, the perfect storm in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just in Chile now and I was very
impressed with like the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even though I'm from South America,
I'd never expected what I'd see there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the cleanest hash we saw
there was 150 to 179.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like indoor, but I mean,
but still, you know, like it's still like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, I'm a big fan of the big
heads and I know that on the out and on
[SPEAKER_01]: the outdoors, pretty challenging unless
you have all this like wind mitigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: like strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the berry crunch that he was just
mentioning, it was very impressive to see
[SPEAKER_01]: like such quality from like outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the cleanest also I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was nice to launch like three
different like microns, like the 90,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 104 and the 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone could just like taste it and
actually taste the difference like between
[SPEAKER_01]: the different microns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's something that we get to do
at home most of the time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're doing like the mouth test and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: 104 definitely is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else have any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bro, you guys are off the hook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like just getting started.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got another question.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have obviously watched material
from a lot of different people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you noticed like a difference in like
people that grow with salts and people
[SPEAKER_08]: that grow organically?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it really make that big of a
difference in the hash?
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do that personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely does in like the size.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've noticed like we had a guy switch over
to organic growing from salts and every
[SPEAKER_05]: time, no matter if he pulled right,
no matter what he did, you'd always get a
[SPEAKER_05]: larger percentage in the 73 bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 120 in the 90s would be minuscule.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we switched over and got him into
like living soil and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And his plants freaked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're starting to get stuff in the
150 bags like we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just seems like the plants,
just the way they responded, they just
[SPEAKER_05]: like literally blew up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outdoor growing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I only have, you know, my little
bit of personal experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, fuck, what was the question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The salts versus organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was totally thinking on the indoor
versus outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that like the quality and
the flavor of the hash, like it totally
[SPEAKER_04]: can all be there with the salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, I don't see that much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like, but I don't feel like I
also have really enough experience washing
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of salt grown stuff that I can
really sit here and say, like that was
[SPEAKER_04]: probably a pretty decent size farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that you saw that at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like a 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a good size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be seeing it on like nine lights,
you know, versus like 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, I don't, I just, I'm not really
comfortable to say that I think salts do
[SPEAKER_04]: anything bad to the resin or that there's
a ton of difference, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm guessing there's a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say something that I think it's a
little sad in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I started growing together with
Flynn, Flynn was growing with salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that for a while with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we switched to organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the most drastic change I
experienced was ethical, ethical,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and less on the like resin
quality because I seen him like pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: that one 50 full melt from like indoor
with salts around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I met him, he gifted me a
jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how he tried to like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how he was like, Oh, this is like,
he gave me like a baller jar of one 50,
[SPEAKER_01]: you full melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that wash on the progressive
commercial with the fishing pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of just to interject a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was kind of thinking about,
but I can't get the thought out is that
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're going to see on salts versus
organic indoor and salts versus organic
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor, I think are going to be very,
two very different outcomes because
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling a real proper organic indoor room
is freaking hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at any scale, even on nine lights,
it's hard as hell to do a good,
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy organic indoor run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or outdoor, that's really pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you kind of throw some water and worm
shit at them in sun and they just kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: rage, you know, but inside they get really
finicky.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what you, you know,
what you're saying on the indoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: I, that's why I didn't want to say that
like salts is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organic is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think on the indoor, I think you
can run some salts and some bottles that
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to like really make those,
those strains perform.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like shine and I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we say that organic is better
because there's all the ethical parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put it like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think under an organic, like more
biologically based system, you are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to see a wider breadth of streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be able to thrive versus with a salt
regimen, you are going to have to do a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more tailoring to dial in what each strain
is really going to need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're really micromanaging things
at like a very small level, which is also
[SPEAKER_03]: why I think, okay, there are definitely
good, you know, I've seen good resin grown
[SPEAKER_03]: in indoor salt rooms, but I don't think it
makes sense on a greenhouse or really at
[SPEAKER_03]: scale in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can figure out how to do organic
living soil and indoors, like it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: sense from every perspective, cost of
goods, like economically, ethically,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just, it's been tough for people to
apply that at scale because big ag has
[SPEAKER_03]: created a very simple system that
basically relies on these kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: exogenous costs that are outside of the
supply chain and you know, cost things on
[SPEAKER_03]: the world and individuals and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not actually built into the people on
the production side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it creates this kind of like what I
would call, you know, uneven structuring
[SPEAKER_03]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sadly that's how it's structured right
now, but if we can change it and do it in
[SPEAKER_03]: a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in the cannabis industry,
we have this very interesting opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: because of where we're at in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your margins are so slim on the,
you know, on the regulated side that if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're the person who's growing into
organic living soil and your cost of goods
[SPEAKER_03]: sold are so much lower than the guy who's
buying fertilizer, which has been getting
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more expensive every year,
your business model actually has a way
[SPEAKER_03]: more longevity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a long-term perspective and not
just this growing a plant for one cycle
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, I think creating a balanced
organic soil system is always going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: better and give you a larger breadth of
genetic variety that will work well easily
[SPEAKER_03]: in that system without having to change
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically when you're doing whole plant
fresh frozen and you're on a more
[SPEAKER_03]: vertically integrated system, like when
you're just buying fresh frozen on the
[SPEAKER_03]: open market, you're really just looking at
what did it cost me to produce this gram?
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're looking at your,
your vertically integrated single source
[SPEAKER_03]: washing your own stuff, you need to be
looking at resin per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause for example, you fresh freeze
Smarties and cookies and cream,
[SPEAKER_03]: one hits 2%, one hits 5%.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to keep running?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you just bottlenecked your menu in a
way because you didn't realize that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, if you do the math for resin per
square foot and understand how many square
[SPEAKER_03]: feet did it take me to grow that kilo of
fresh frozen versus this kilo and do the
[SPEAKER_03]: math on like basically you just have to
say, how much resin did I produce?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much square footage did I produce it
in?
[SPEAKER_03]: That will give you your resin per square
foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So however you want to do that,
if you're in beds and you say,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, you know, I grew a 60 by 100 of this
strain and I got this much resin per that
[SPEAKER_03]: square footage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you're going to want to measure
every other thing that you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going by the same standard and
then looking at it, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to say, wow, the Smarties,
even though it does or a strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it does two and a quarter
percent, when I go resin per square foot,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's actually only maybe 10% less than
something else that when I grow it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse, I'm going to get three
quarters or maybe half as much fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot of strains that are very good
for hash, you know, not all of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a lot of them that produce a lot of
resin might not put out that much flower
[SPEAKER_03]: weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have to go back to the resin
per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we always used to do pounds per
light, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the real measurement in a way,
not pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really want to be grams per watt or
grams per square foot, depending on what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're wanting to like base your business
model on and what your most restrictive
[SPEAKER_03]: costs are and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think when you're, when you get to
the single source and like vertically
[SPEAKER_03]: integrated level and you're not working
with like fresh frozen on the open market,
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at resin per square foot is so
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the future, like choosing genetics
based on that is going to put people miles
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're not bottlenecking all your
things into this like 5% model that a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people are on with the fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they're kind of, you kind of have to
be, cause you're working with cultivators
[SPEAKER_03]: or buying it at a price point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's your, you know,
your economic variable that you're working
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was actually my question was what
is the number you're trying to hit as
[SPEAKER_07]: we're at the end of your farm with your
grams per square foot or resin per square
[SPEAKER_07]: foot?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that number that's desired?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know more is always desired,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's the number that's average or
what's the one that's kind of like top
[SPEAKER_07]: tier and will catch your eye or draw you
in that direction?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to, I guess, compare because my
resin per square foot is based on like a
[SPEAKER_03]: wholesale price that my assumption might
be like vastly different depending on what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're, you're always going to be
basically wanting to compare things at
[SPEAKER_03]: your same wholesale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll get a comparative, but you're
not really, you're not maybe looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain dollar per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you do your comparative across
your garden based on your wholesale,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause if I say my number, if your
wholesale is a lot different, higher or
[SPEAKER_03]: lower, you're going to be at a way
different number.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: The number is grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like resin grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor.
No, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just am honestly struggling off the top
of my head to remember what that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I always convert it honestly into
revenue because that is my ultimate end
[SPEAKER_03]: measurement is revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also because I have a tiered thing of like
we produce melt and rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some strains, it's hard to compare them
at the resin per square foot level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause for example, Smarties and cookies
and cream, it puts out like two and a half
[SPEAKER_03]: percent just melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the variable and the, and the wholesale
rate of that is different for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets to be this kind of like hard to
compare.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you go to revenue per square foot
or grams per square foot, if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: producing all rosin or you're just have an
equal wholesale for things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in reality, from a business
perspective, you should be looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to always convert your
grams per square foot, your wholesale
[SPEAKER_03]: price, and then look at your revenue,
especially when you maybe create multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: tiers of product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause one of the biggest advantages in
business and in the cannabis industry from
[SPEAKER_03]: a solvent-less perspective is you have the
ability to create multiple products from
[SPEAKER_03]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when you do a bubble hash and you
do an ice water extraction, you can get a
[SPEAKER_03]: super high quality foam melt, a nice rosin
grade, a food grade, all of those things
[SPEAKER_03]: versus someone who does a solvent
extraction is going to kind of be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you back like one, one grade of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people are finding that to
really get all the profit out of something
[SPEAKER_03]: like a, just a common like, you know,
business tactic that is called product
[SPEAKER_03]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it allows you to actually extract all
the profit possible out of like a
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're looking at that,
that's kind of, I guess the way I would
[SPEAKER_03]: look at it and why it's hard to answer
your grams per square foot also cause
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor outdoor greenhouse, you're going to
be looking at a lot of different things
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but I'd say, let me think,
let me think about it, do some quick math
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I'll get you the grams per square
foot on average on like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like five by five type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me add to that quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, not on business, but something I've
been talking about a while and I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a straight answer either because the
first run, I started doing resin per
[SPEAKER_04]: square foot versus percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did some mix wash it washes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I couldn't say exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this much resin off to square
footage, but I'm asking people to start
[SPEAKER_04]: getting away from wash percentages because
everybody is tunneling vision on high wash
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we are missing things because
they don't wash it 5%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might wash it two and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to use the sour D for
example, was the last room I grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The strain next to it pulls one,
let's just call it 1.5 pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour D pulls three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: This strain washes at 6%.
[SPEAKER_04]: This strain washes at 3%.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the end, the revenue is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's the big thing to take away
from resin per square foot versus,
[SPEAKER_04]: versus is it a 3% washer, a 6% washer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to start as hash
makers, opening ourselves up to different
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics that we aren't necessarily
looking at because the hash walk,
[SPEAKER_04]: the percentage isn't so high, but the
square per square foot number might be,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the revenue in the end might be
the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my personal vendetta to get
people off of just looking at percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And get more into resin per square foot
and resin per square foot is going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: different for everybody based on how you
measure your square footage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you measuring the table itself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you measuring the room?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you measuring the canopy per run?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so everybody's going to have to
start to come up with their own baseline
[SPEAKER_04]: of what is acceptable in their garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so just food for thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, based on canopy size, if my quick
math was correct, like low end five and a
half feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have high end like seven to eight grams
of square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in like GMO numbers or like
something that's hitting like 7% type of
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five to seven grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did my quick math right, that's
probably wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll end it with shout out to Go
Country Resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew, he's in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love this guy right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another really talented hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Hash Camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is happening from the second to the
fourth of December.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to be back here December 2nd
through the 5th for Hash Camp,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we're going to have wash demos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be doing a dry sift demo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a multi-day thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to camp.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hang out for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a blast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something to look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we doing a wash demo too?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might do a wash demo too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing a dry sift demo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody better be doing a wash demo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a hashy weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like whoever loves hash and resin and
wants to come hang out, learn,
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss, exchange terms, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mapping it up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at each other's numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll know what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: On average, like one light, let's say I
get like 3,200 wet grams on like a 5%
[SPEAKER_03]: yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 3,200.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 5 by 5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually grow on a 4 by 4 table,
but I always got that little extra socket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.
So 3,200.
3,200.
3,200.
