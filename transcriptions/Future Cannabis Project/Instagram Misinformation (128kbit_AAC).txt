[SPEAKER_00]: you know the instagram is really making a
lot of people's lives harder because so
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it is not even real like you know
there's a there's a like there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: project you know like ah man just so pause
but like this whole this whole thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: dark heart like i i have some really
intimate knowledge about how this started
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the timeline was and and i just i
don't feel comfortable speaking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly because i'm still you know a
small fry i'm not trying to go after
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody and you know every time we speak we
have to think about what potential clients
[SPEAKER_00]: might be thinking and they don't want
project and they'll pull up something from
[SPEAKER_00]: the gram you know and they'll ask me about
it i'm like i have intimate of that
[SPEAKER_00]: intimate knowledge of that project it
didn't work they don't do that anymore and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd be like but the picture's still up
i'm like i'm telling you they don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that anymore they did it once it didn't
work they don't do it anymore and then
[SPEAKER_00]: then they respond with well i contacted
the manufacturer and i'm getting a quote
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm like well that didn't work and they're
like yeah well we're thinking it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: you know increase canopy and i'm like that
didn't work and they're like but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make more widgets i'm like the
people that you're copying only did at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time it didn't work you know and i don't
know how we get there because nobody wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to admit failures and no you know people
are so worried about their brand being
[SPEAKER_00]: damaged they don't put nothing on the gram
and then and then but but we can all move
[SPEAKER_00]: faster so much better and and move forward
in such a better more effective economical
[SPEAKER_00]: way if there was a little bit more
transparency transparency and humility and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's not my place to share these
failures you know i you know it's not my
[SPEAKER_00]: place to to share failures with the world
and so a lot of times i'm really in a
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely handcuffed position you know
sitting at a at a at a project management
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting or something it's like i can't
even necessarily say all the details of
[SPEAKER_00]: how bad it went sometime because that
would be inappropriate you know it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't know how we get there but we we
got to find a way to stop perpetuating the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that never worked once you know
well and that's where all the designing
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in and these people that want to
create the futuristic a sprinkle of this a
[SPEAKER_01]: sprinkle of that a little of this you know
i bought the best of this how can anything
[SPEAKER_01]: go wrong and a lot of times you know i
mean you can use some of the events for an
[SPEAKER_01]: example like even the emerald cup you know
there's some fairly you know not very
[SPEAKER_01]: fancy greenhouses to create some of the
best pot you ever seen you know and so in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of ways you know i always teach
people in the in the oakster dam
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse class you know when they're
talking about investors and proof of
[SPEAKER_01]: concept and things like that get a little
hoop house yeah you know get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard hoop house pull some tarps and i
guarantee you in two months you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn a lot even if you blow it you're
going to learn a lot but the proof of
[SPEAKER_01]: concept that people are willing to shell
out and do right now is is is the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: facility it's not they don't even do proof
of concept they just go all in well
[SPEAKER_00]: because every everybody wants those early
margins and they quote kevin joe about the
[SPEAKER_00]: early margins you know what i mean it's
like we got to get the early margins
[SPEAKER_00]: before the market dips it's like you've
had six straight crop loss what margins
[SPEAKER_00]: are you grabbing we need to we need to we
need to reduce we need to reduce down to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that that can be executed
correctly and start there and that's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know maybe a little bit of hope for the
small guys out there like i'm telling you
[SPEAKER_00]: these big facilities are blowing it on a
mega scale and just focus on executing
[SPEAKER_00]: well at whatever scale you can and that's
like i just had a phone call yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: eric and i as a project we're both working
on it's like they want to do the full
[SPEAKER_00]: extent of the permit 10 and you know eric
and i both give the same advice like how
[SPEAKER_00]: about you take that budget and do whatever
that is 100 you know what what do you mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna partially fertilize with
crappy salts like what are you even
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about like put some good soil in
one greenhouse let the other five wait
[SPEAKER_00]: execute one well you know get something
you know i think these huge facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you have enough room to to try
something in one whether it's even a small
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse if you got three beds do
something different in one don't do it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole project because these radical
changes don't always work and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: costly and sometimes when we come up with
something we got to make a radical change
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to do the job or do the trick
but then we've already you know the run
[SPEAKER_01]: again the runway is gone like people are
willing to blow the runway on a lot and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's part of the problem the excitement
it is it's how you hook it's how you hook
[SPEAKER_02]: the money is you show them you're going to
get paid big quick right and the problem
[SPEAKER_02]: is that that's how they set the the
project up to begin with instead of saying
[SPEAKER_02]: look this is our seven-year plan these are
the numbers we're going to run through a
[SPEAKER_02]: course of time here's our here's our first
year which we need to succeed in so let's
[SPEAKER_02]: succeed that'll give faith and trust faith
and trust can multiply instead it's we
[SPEAKER_02]: promise these people we're gonna blow this
shit up and someone tell me he goes i got
[SPEAKER_02]: my plan to play kev he goes i'm gonna i
have to nail four pounds of light to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it work and i said fucking game the whole
facility wrong way bro i said homie i said
[SPEAKER_02]: you put me something a really tough
position yeah and he's like yeah but i i
[SPEAKER_02]: ran a plant you gave me and when i when i
extrapolated the data from that plant it
[SPEAKER_02]: could give me that through a whole fucking
facility and i said wow that's not quite
[SPEAKER_02]: the risk that i was trying to push you
into two yeah you have to be able to to
[SPEAKER_02]: have that honesty in the beginning with
the money and yeah what it does it gives
[SPEAKER_02]: you a buffer and so whenever you're that's
what i try to give advice to people when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're speaking about investment or
they're trying to gather someone to fund
[SPEAKER_02]: the operation is fucking be honest sit
down and lay out the facts and if they
[SPEAKER_02]: accept your business plan they accept it
and if they don't they don't you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get to do the med men shit and
look at mowden they're fucking going after
[SPEAKER_02]: his house exactly so he's not out of the
clear either so he's got himself some
[SPEAKER_02]: problems because of what occurred and i
don't know them i've never met them and so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's nothing personal but it's it's it's
something that other people copied and
[SPEAKER_02]: said we're going to copy that model and
the problem is it doesn't work at all for
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody who's trying to do legitimate
cannabis production if you desire us to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a cannabis producer and you intend to do
this for time it's not some get rich quick
[SPEAKER_02]: screen because you jumped out of fucking
pet rocks and and mink coats you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: got two chillers in your basement any of
these little fat ass things it's the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing it's it's it's got to be legitimate
work and it's got to be legitimate
[SPEAKER_02]: progress and you just have to be able to
start at a level that you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve and i see some of these operations
and i'm just like oh shit how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly light up something this big
without any prior experience yep and then
[SPEAKER_00]: and then yeah and then dysfunctionally
stick into the calendar when it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: working they don't want to stop the
conveyor belt to fix the core issues you
[SPEAKER_00]: know they don't want to stop and go this
isn't working you know there's always
[SPEAKER_00]: someone saying we got to stick to timeline
we got to stick to timeline we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to timeline it's like let's just
pause and take a deep breath you know i've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard eric say that a lot of time give
really practical advice like let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: let's stop the bleeding let's take a deep
breath let's focus on what is working and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's multiply that like you know you know
you just got quoted on a phone call i had
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday about a farm that's been having
some problems they want to increase and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like do you want to multiply your
problems why are you doing that right now
[SPEAKER_00]: like why would you expand something that's
not being lucrative why yeah i mean do you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to expand problems like yeah and the
critical point that you brought up a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute ago is the data that's being
created so if people are creating data off
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant you know like you know that data
point says i got a plant from kevin jowdry
[SPEAKER_01]: right you know and that particular plant i
got from this guy at this level can scale
[SPEAKER_01]: up to this and people in the investment
side need data in order to you know really
[SPEAKER_01]: be hooked and so we got people creating
data on one light one plant one homie or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever and it turns into this portfolio
of how we can hit it and crush it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the poor person sitting there going i got
four pounds per light to perform and well
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like fuck dude that kind of
backfired on you know like you got the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck i mean that's 800 lights yeah yeah
like come on i can't sleep at night even
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it like i mean i will say
that's the one beauty of metric and track
[SPEAKER_00]: and trace is that there's no fool in that
shit yeah and like you so the there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big asterisk about you know we run in this
a lot because you're starting to see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of salt guys getting into living soils
because the returns on rosin and extract
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not motivated to do it they
just want that extra 30 40 percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: resident and they always want to well how
many can you get per light well how many
[SPEAKER_00]: can get per light and it's like what are
you basing that off of bucked down nugs is
[SPEAKER_00]: that fully trimmed is that bag bag without
shape is that bagged as per metric like
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that what's that three even mean
what's that four even mean where is that
[SPEAKER_00]: guidepost and what is you know because i
don't know man i've seen a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: metric reports i've been in some hydro
facilities that claim three and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: four and then they shoot you the metric
print out and it's more like one and three
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter to two and an eighth type thing
you know which ain't bad if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently do that without failing two
lights great consistently without failing
[SPEAKER_00]: but like you know you can't be saying i
did three a light counting stems you know
[SPEAKER_02]: no and the thing is if i'm glad that
you're getting biomass but if nobody wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy the fucking product you smoke it
then who cares i'm like it's it's the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing with trends where you know every
every every large operation group i had a
[SPEAKER_02]: guy i talked to he said you know i have
800 unique cultivars and i said no you
[SPEAKER_02]: won't have like 20 right multiplied by
fucking 40 and that's really what you got
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was like i said it's it's it's
let's just be reasonable and let's admit
[SPEAKER_02]: what we have and start to try to work on
you know your direction what is it you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to achieve and and at some of these
giant operations with the economy of scale
[SPEAKER_02]: they need to take the the the lower price
market they want to produce it cheap but
[SPEAKER_02]: sell it for hot level prices and it
doesn't work and the poor guy is on the
[SPEAKER_02]: small end they have to get premium pricing
because they don't have the scale yeah and
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can't you can't be small and
capitulate and it's tough because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: you're over a table financially and the
bigger guys just got to realize that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nothing wrong with with allowing
people to get you know with your numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: you can achieve you're selling it at the
store for $27 you'll make money and your
[SPEAKER_02]: brand will survive and you'll gather
market share and you didn't build an 80
[SPEAKER_02]: million dollar facility in this form to
grow craft exquisite cannabis they're
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not the same animal and there's no
shame in it but no one wants to admit
[SPEAKER_02]: little guys want to say that they're big i
got 8 000 square feet i'm big and guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that got 400 000 square feet want to say
to craft right just admit it it's okay i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking five seven i'm short i can say
that shit it's easy i'm short i've never
[SPEAKER_02]: been fucking pretty either yeah i've never
been pretty either it's it's what it is
[SPEAKER_02]: and that way you can work with that and it
just works and and that's that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're having to come into is that a lot of
the stuff that you know you're you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting out is is like you know you you
and eric both you give enough information
[SPEAKER_02]: out to give people concepts and ideas to
go move forward where they start to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize hey i'm using these tools i'm not
having a fact what am i doing wrong maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: i need to research and so the education
process happens but it's amazing how fast
[SPEAKER_02]: it happens with owner operators versus
investment teams the investment team is
[SPEAKER_02]: you got to get this fucking meeting
together and then you're going to zoom six
[SPEAKER_02]: guys and and there's one guy who doesn't
want to listen and he's the only guy that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes the fucking decision so you got to
get this dude to come into your world and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that you're actually trying to
fucking help them and i watch this and i
[SPEAKER_02]: it's such an education because i'm like
how the fuck did they build all these
[SPEAKER_02]: industries in the world if all of them
were built like this did they basically
[SPEAKER_02]: just fuck up until they solved it is that
how all projects are done maybe it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: education in reality that i never expected
i never thought yeah 100 man that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things you know no disrespect
to this some of the money guys but like no
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the things that i always
crack up like is if this is how you make
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions how did you get the money to
build this facility well i think there was
[SPEAKER_01]: more universities there was more things
there were studies there was more there
[SPEAKER_01]: was more to it and this just came out of
nowhere like we just pulled this shit out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the woods and here you go i mean look
at the way things are going we it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: long ago that we were worried about you
know uh getting in trouble and now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: essential business yeah yeah i mean i know
holy fuck yeah that was a quick transition
[SPEAKER_00]: i know i know like jesus that was that was
a hard pill for my family to swallow i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working and they're not they've been
judging for a decade for a trap kid it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like wow i'm yeah you're never gonna make
any you're never gonna do it yeah it's
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy yeah you I'll see you in the next
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
