[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to talk a little bit about
codes now in a bigger, not so focused on
[SPEAKER_08]: the specifics of the California code that
Kyle was looking for last night,
[SPEAKER_08]: but really stepping back a little bit,
taking a look more broadly at how codes
[SPEAKER_08]: are developed, their role, the different
parts that come into play, and sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: what the action has been on the codes
front for CEA facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a great stellar panel here with
lots of experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to hear from Keith Corson of
Desert Air.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to talk to us a little bit
about some of the various industry-led
[SPEAKER_08]: codes and standards affecting the industry
and the equipment that's being used.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hear from Alexi Miller with the New
Buildings Institute, who's been doing work
[SPEAKER_08]: on codes, the national model codes,
as well as input to other codes across the
[SPEAKER_08]: country, and then from Kyle Booth with a
little bit more on what they're looking at
[SPEAKER_08]: for California in the Title 24 process.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with no further ado, I'll bring up
Keith, and we can hear about the acronym
[SPEAKER_08]: SUP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll focus on the HVAC standards
activity and try to put a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bow over the acronyms and all the
different standards that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at it from a
manufacturer's point of view, really being
[SPEAKER_00]: driven by two different organizations,
the first one is AHRI, which is the trade
[SPEAKER_00]: association for all the air conditioning
and heating and ventilating companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then AHAM, which is more the
appliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why these two become
important is for most of the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning and larger dehumidification
systems being used, they're the AHRI one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the portable dehumidifiers fall under
the jurisdiction of the AHAM ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got to make sure that we
compensate and understand that there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: different rating positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the professional societies
that we've already heard on the ASHRAE and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ASABE, which we actually heard from
Nadia just before, and I'll just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: put a little bit of an explanation point
on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within AHRI, there is no plant type of
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody starts referring back to,
I have an air conditioner, I want an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would be the 340, 360.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have just an air conditioning
load.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a dehumidification load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could look at the pool one and look at
standard 910 and get a moisture removal
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency standard of pounds per hour of
condensate with a kilowatt input.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that really doesn't apply because the
temperatures and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: elements aren't consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's standard 920,
which gets us into the dedicated outside
[SPEAKER_00]: air systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very complicated standard
because it's trying to handle all the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather climactic conditions that are
represented across really North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually rates at four different
conditions in the cooling dehumidification
[SPEAKER_00]: mode and two different conditions in the
heating mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you talk about this multiple
standard, multiple parameter type system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets a very complicated one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just ended up our conversation
after 10 years of trying to develop this
[SPEAKER_00]: code and have finally got the Department
of Energy to sign off on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be hearing more about that
particular code if you're in the HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: industry finally here after 10 years of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bring up the 10 years of work
because none of these happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of work in developing the
standards as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the AHAM actually has the 7008,
2018 was the last the code cycle for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's under the appliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about this
particular code is all the units being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested don't have any duct work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're what we call freestanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just put in the space and they
blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at other systems that
have to go through duct work, it cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to the AHAM standard because the
blowers and the energy costs that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we need to
understand in the difference with that one
[SPEAKER_00]: as was just being talked a little bit
earlier by Nadia was the amount of duct
[SPEAKER_00]: work and filters and other things that you
put on system equipment drives up the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement for the load.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at that AHAM standard,
the fan has no static pressure to go
[SPEAKER_00]: against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rating is much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're using a rating here in SI
units at 2.7 liters per kilowatt hour and
[SPEAKER_00]: you could translate that one over into
pounds an hour but the problem is there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no duct work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to apply the two
standards into one common platform as we
[SPEAKER_00]: go forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Within ASHRAE, we've got two different
committees that are trying to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.2 is the plant and animal committee
which has just really taken on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis side of it and this is a very,
very recent event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've only actually met twice to have
this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the trade show in Orlando this past
February, they had standing room only at
[SPEAKER_00]: two different events talking about this
particular standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of interest in it,
a lot of people coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is the large building
segment that kind of owns a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the related one and so these two have to
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're both trying to write a handbook
standard to start to get preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: information out there of how you have to
size the HVAC equipment in this new
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and so it's going to provide the
guidance to the engineering community that
[SPEAKER_00]: are working with all the other people in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at getting some
research money put together and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the evapotranspiration rate which is the
critical aspect to sizing the HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting load is one but because of the
cooling effect of it, we have to know how
[SPEAKER_00]: much is being transpired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we can't calculate the load.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read all you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a single documented research
paper that's going to say for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the type of rate that you have and
we've got to come to that conclusion if we
[SPEAKER_00]: want right sized equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ASABE is also working on it and
they've got two different standards that
[SPEAKER_00]: are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is in the HVAC side of it
and they're kind of looking at it from all
[SPEAKER_00]: the same elements that ASHRAE would look
at it but they're trying to do it and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to make sure that we stay in
concert with both organizations and so
[SPEAKER_00]: they are talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have already published the S642 which
is the recommended standard for the LED
[SPEAKER_00]: light type system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really what I'm saying right now
there is absolutely nothing out there to
[SPEAKER_00]: define a standard for the HVAC units.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist and if you were at the
code conversation last night with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Title 24 people, we just have to use some
loose verbiage in these early days because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing we can reference as it
goes forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I guess it gives us a
chance to kind of organize our thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: and get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the AHRI spring meeting, we're actually
going to be bringing it forward to the
[SPEAKER_00]: board to look at a development of a
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where my request is going to
come back to the rest of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were all in this room today is that we
have to come back and come up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: rating standard which means I have to have
a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to have an RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is a single point going to be
acceptable to this industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need multiple points that get
weighted?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the type of decisions
that we need to come to feed the systems
[SPEAKER_00]: as we work on this standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can already tell you that as it
goes, we get federally regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Energy is then going to
take over the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done it every standard that we've
done at AHRI and it matters to what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch over because there
were some conversations the other day on
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole refrigerant transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is that the HVAC
industry is absolutely committed to going
[SPEAKER_00]: to proper GWP, low GWP rating
refrigerants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is moving forward whether the federal
government goes that way or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know all the states are starting to
do their own little thing along with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we cannot move faster than the
research allows us to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leading candidates going for the
large bulk of HVAC equipment will contain
[SPEAKER_00]: flammable elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the building safety code people
have to sign off of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: California was a prime example where one
group was not allowing it, actually
[SPEAKER_00]: disallowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other group reporting to the governor
was promoting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets very difficult to be able to put a
piece of equipment in where two different
[SPEAKER_00]: people are saying you can or you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see anything really
come into the industry until 2023 at the
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gut feel is it's going to be 2024 or
2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the low GWP refrigerants are going to
finally get through all the design and
[SPEAKER_00]: research to become part of the platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good news is we're going to get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad news, we're not going to get there
for a couple more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lexi?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to shift gears just a
little.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to bring it from the
standards, which are referred to in codes,
[SPEAKER_03]: up to the level of codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to go, as a bit of a broad
brush here, I'm looking in large part at
[SPEAKER_03]: model codes, at codes that maybe transcend
more than one jurisdiction because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: adopted by several different
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And NBI has been involved for some years
in the development of national model
[SPEAKER_03]: codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get too deep into
anything because I have, what,
[SPEAKER_03]: eight minutes here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a little bit of background on why we
are even talking about building energy
[SPEAKER_03]: codes in this context.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to the DOE, they say energy
codes save building owners about $5
[SPEAKER_03]: billion a year in energy cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, this is quite a bit more over
the lifetime of a building.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they say 2010 to 2040, in that 30 year
span, we're looking at $126 billion with a
[SPEAKER_03]: B of energy cost savings to building
owners because we have codes in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something like 245 coal plants worth
of carbon dioxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is critical that we think about when we
want to do this efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot easier to do these kinds of
projects when you build the building than
[SPEAKER_03]: it is to go try to retrofit this stuff in
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea with an energy code is build
it pretty good the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sets the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a form of quality assurance for
the people who are going to be using that
[SPEAKER_03]: building and the occupants of that
building, whether they be plants or
[SPEAKER_03]: humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to have codes that achieve
these kinds of goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're pretty good at it, reasonably,
broadly speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pretty good at it for buildings
intended for humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a little bit of a square peg
round hole situation trying to adapt these
[SPEAKER_03]: human-centric codes to plant-centric
buildings and occupancies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way building energy codes work,
in the briefest nutshell, it sets the
[SPEAKER_03]: minimum efficiency requirement for a
building, something that triggers code.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it defines what I like to say is a
code defines the worst possible building
[SPEAKER_03]: you can legally build.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to do at least this much and
then on from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The energy code is one of the several
building codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got energy, you've got structure,
you've got fire, you've got water,
[SPEAKER_03]: plumbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are coming from national model
codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's this organization, the
International Code Council.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, for example, one of the things I do
a lot is work with the development of the
[SPEAKER_03]: International Energy Conservation Code,
IECC, which comes under the ICC's ambit,
[SPEAKER_03]: broadly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a jurisdiction, Colorado, well,
not California, Colorado, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone but California, basically says,
we'll take the 2018 version of the
[SPEAKER_03]: International Energy Conservation Code.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take the 2015 version.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take the 2021 version.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they make some amendments.
[SPEAKER_03]: They change things here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes a lot, sometimes just a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have this common framework that
they're starting from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing we have focused on over the
years is moving that national model code
[SPEAKER_03]: forward so that as jurisdictions adopt,
they have a better framework and we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with something reasonably
consistent across the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, in indoor ag with cannabis
specifically, you also have licensing
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some jurisdictions have said,
well, we're not going to do this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: through the code.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this doesn't really fall under
energy code.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can do it in a licensing
requirement scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have things you've got to do
with to meet code that can vary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe there are also some of the
elements that used to be in an energy code
[SPEAKER_03]: or could potentially be, but they're
actually part of your license,
[SPEAKER_03]: very briefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea with national model codes is to
provide a consistent framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, every state and lots of
jurisdictions sub-state are on different
[SPEAKER_03]: or in a different place with the adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably pretty hard to read those
captions down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's everything from ASHRAE 90.1
2007 all the way up to 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, there are more versions
coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a three year cycle going through
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple of states, especially
Arizona and Colorado, Colorado pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: relevant in this market, have a lot of
local adoptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So NBI, for example, helped Boulder
develop their energy code.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the last several years, we've been
doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a consistent framework,
but it's in different places in different
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdictions around the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
what is in this broad national model code
[SPEAKER_03]: framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to start with lighting,
because that's where we've spent some
[SPEAKER_03]: effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: NBI was successful in moving through a
proposal for the 2021 IECC, the model code
[SPEAKER_03]: that the IECC is currently using.
And they actually have a wide variety of
different types of light fixtures that
[SPEAKER_03]: different states and different
jurisdictions can use to use this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to go through a number of
different criteria to get to the light
[SPEAKER_03]: fixtures that NBI has.
So I'm going to go through a number of
criteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going to talk a little bit
about the NBI standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So NBI standards, which are very
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: that's something you can reference in a
model code.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was approved by the voters,
which are cities, states, building
[SPEAKER_03]: department officials, et cetera,
for inclusion in the 2021 national model
[SPEAKER_03]: code.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be a few years before this
filters down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what this does is this gives a common
framework, which as we know isn't always
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly the same thing, and Kyle talked
about that a little bit, about how it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not always going exactly this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is this common framework and a
baseline, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still do double-ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about 1.7 micromoles per joule,
but probably not single-ended and not
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it must be at least this good to play.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also gives someone running,
say, a utility program a way to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, here's a reasonable baseline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you get a product that's on the
qualified products list from the Design
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights Consortium, here's the difference
between how good that one is and where the
[SPEAKER_03]: code is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sets the floor, puts us all in a common
understanding, and uses this metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about HVAC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are national model codes in HVAC,
in dehumidification?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we have in the model codes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not to say this topic is never
represented in codes, and it's definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: not to say that codes are not relevant in
terms of HVAC systems going into indoor ag
[SPEAKER_03]: or into horticulture facilities,
because you do have to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_03]: codes in terms of HVAC when you put a
facility together, design a system,
[SPEAKER_03]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really in the national model
codes, but it is a relevant concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is this a challenge?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mentioned earlier, there's a little
bit of a square peg round hole situation
[SPEAKER_03]: when we try to take these codes that were
originally built for humans and adapt them
[SPEAKER_03]: for plants or for facilities intended to
grow plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as we've been hearing several times
through this conference, there are
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in creating conditions in a
space that are ideal for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dehumidification is a huge piece of that,
and I'm glad to hear, as Keith mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: that there are efforts to create
consistent metrics for these
[SPEAKER_03]: dehumidification systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we will end up in a place where,
kind of like for lighting, I'll go back a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple slides, where we have this
generally consistent approach where we
[SPEAKER_03]: say, here's the basic efficiency,
be at least this good, and off you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe with some good metrics on
dehumidification, there'll be something
[SPEAKER_03]: along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not there yet today,
and that's probably fine, because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: enormous variability between facilities,
between practices, which makes it hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: define the baseline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're faced with some challenges and
opportunities as we try to define
[SPEAKER_03]: consistent code frameworks in the national
model code, in the ways jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_03]: might set up their own codes, and their
licensing regulations, right, because they
[SPEAKER_03]: can act kind of in the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just highlight a couple of these
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: One question, of course, what is the
baseline, is a pretty important piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not always clear where we're
starting from.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're running an incentive program or
as a jurisdiction, what is good practice?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Derek and his team at RII have done
some really good work in defining best
[SPEAKER_03]: practices on lighting and HVAC both.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some places where the code
touches these facilities that can lead to
[SPEAKER_03]: unintended consequences or can lead to
some challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if you've got a facility with
a ton of indoor loads, lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: dehumidification, and it's producing a lot
of heat, should it be very well insulated,
[SPEAKER_03]: or is that insulation just keeping the
heat in and leading to more energy use
[SPEAKER_03]: that you need to deal with?
[SPEAKER_03]: The code may say insulate your envelope.
[SPEAKER_03]: The code may also say put on an airside
economizer so you can bring in outside
[SPEAKER_03]: air.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in Oregon, for example, in a few
facilities, there are folks that have had
[SPEAKER_03]: to do that, tried to get a variance,
didn't get that variance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they built their facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put in the economizers they had to
put in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing they did, weld it shut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's an economizer on the roof,
but it ain't doing much, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really an unintended consequence
of using a code that was built for human
[SPEAKER_03]: occupancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some challenges there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to say, in terms of lighting,
lumens are for humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think having a PPE, protosynthetic
photonic efficiency of efficacy,
[SPEAKER_03]: excuse me, provides a good way for us to
think about efficiency or efficacy in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of lighting fixtures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that people in this
room, I think, have a pretty good handle
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the case of Massachusetts and now
Illinois, we've got a different animal
[SPEAKER_03]: going on, which is watts of lighting per
square foot of canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you've got these two different
approaches that are a bit different and
[SPEAKER_03]: are introducing, I think, something of a
challenge, or at least have the ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main point I want to make is that,
broadly speaking, we want to move codes
[SPEAKER_03]: forward because we want these facilities
to be built well, both in terms of energy,
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of greenhouse gas impacts,
in terms of getting good facilities for
[SPEAKER_03]: the people who are procuring them,
the owners, the operators, and doing their
[SPEAKER_03]: job.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are not there to say,
of energy, they're there to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want them to do that in a
responsible way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want good code approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want consistent code approaches so the
market knows what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we all have some thinking to do about
how do we come up with the right
[SPEAKER_03]: approaches, define the right metrics,
whether that's for lighting, various
[SPEAKER_03]: components of HVAC, or some kind of
integrated everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holistic solutions, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to think about how to actually do
that for indoor horticulture specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, we'll be on to Kyle in that
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Alexi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank everyone that joined
the codes discussion last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was definitely lively.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just amazing what happens when
you schedule it after happy hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all that joined.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to talk about the statewide
utilities team for Title 24 Part 6 of the
[SPEAKER_05]: California Building Code.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why do codes matter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Indoor cultivation is expanding,
and particularly in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're expected to see 390 gigawatt
hours by 2021.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a large load.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the proposed codes are designed to save
growers' costs by reducing energy use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we just have a quick example.
[SPEAKER_05]: And looking at if a facility had 244
lights on flour, you're looking at annual
[SPEAKER_05]: cost savings of $83,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: Veg, looking at upwards of $100,000 plus
annually savings.
[SPEAKER_05]: So California Building Energy Efficiency
Standards, the energy code is on a
[SPEAKER_05]: three-year cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, we're working on what's the
2022 energy code.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just barely 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're a couple years out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that won't take effect till January 1,
2023.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a regular process in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's on a pretty regular cycle with
formalized steps that allow for
[SPEAKER_05]: stakeholder engagement, review of the
proposed codes, and all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: documentation that's associated with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of the legislature that's
gone through in different states,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a formal process that's on a
rolling basis for the energy code.
[SPEAKER_05]: So controlled environment horticulture,
this proposal will impact newly
[SPEAKER_05]: constructed warehouses in addition to
major renovations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not going to tell a grower that's
growing right now, as of January 1,
[SPEAKER_05]: 2023, switch all your lights out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be someone who is building
new or putting on a major addition or a
[SPEAKER_05]: major renovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at more than just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are looking at vegetable crops,
microgreens, basil, lettuce, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have added greenhouse lighting and
greenhouse envelope as proposed measures.
[SPEAKER_05]: The greenhouse envelope, I will touch on
that because that's a little bit different
[SPEAKER_05]: than some of the other measures.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually more of a codes cleanup
because what we've run into is some
[SPEAKER_05]: growers meet the definition of a condition
space by having mechanical AC,
[SPEAKER_05]: some of those type of sealed greenhouses
that we heard about earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're having a lot of trouble
meeting compliance because they're
[SPEAKER_05]: triggering the envelope portion of Title
24.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in that envelope portion, there's
nothing specific to greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're having to meet basically like a
warehouse or something like that envelope.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you know, that's really not feasible
with regular greenhouse materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to make that so it is,
you know, it's possible to comply with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the statewide utility codes and
standards team, so they actively support
[SPEAKER_05]: the California Energy Commission in
developing these codes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a, you know, congregation of all
the IOUs in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're really trying to make,
they're trying to produce energy savings
[SPEAKER_05]: through feasible, enforceable,
cost-effective and non-proprietary codes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we don't want to propose
something that's not cost-effective or
[SPEAKER_05]: that is overly burdensome for the grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the overall goal here is to provide the
information needed so that the Energy
[SPEAKER_05]: Commission can make an informed decision
on how to set a code.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's energy and demand impacts,
cost-effectiveness, technical feasibility,
[SPEAKER_05]: market impacts, crop quality and
productivity.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're getting out of the human
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is important to think of,
you know, okay, this is a process and we
[SPEAKER_05]: want to make sure that anything that we
propose isn't going to hurt that process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So suggested code language, compliance and
enforcement, you know, how are we going to
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that what we're recommending is
actually done and done properly?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's some key dates for the
controlled environment horticulture
[SPEAKER_05]: measure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do have some flyers that you guys
can take after, so I'll have those out
[SPEAKER_05]: after this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So April 16th is our next public
stakeholder meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see at the end of this,
there's a link to, you know, how to sign
[SPEAKER_05]: up for that and register.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope everyone will join and
definitely give your feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Draft case report will be published.
[SPEAKER_05]: The case report is really our
recommendations and documentation of what
[SPEAKER_05]: went into all this research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be published May 15th on
title24stakeholders.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a really good resource for just
anything as far as updates on the code
[SPEAKER_05]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can go and click and look at
controlled environment horticulture and it
[SPEAKER_05]: will give you an email, you know,
mailing list specific to that measure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So any major things that happen to that
measure, you'll get an email.
[SPEAKER_05]: Final case report.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after we do that part,
it goes to the energy commission and they
[SPEAKER_05]: have a series of, you know, public
stakeholder meetings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then next year in April 2021 is when
the actual adoption of the standards will
[SPEAKER_05]: happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then January 1, 2023 is the effective
date.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at the particular sub measures
that we have, and I know we're running low
[SPEAKER_05]: on time, so I'm going to go a little bit
quick, but leave time for questions after
[SPEAKER_05]: we're looking at a horticulture minimum
lighting efficacy, dehumidification
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiency, environmental and irrigation
controls, circulation fan minimum
[SPEAKER_05]: performance, and then the greenhouse
lighting and greenhouse envelope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at horticultural lighting
efficacy, we're looking at using a product
[SPEAKER_05]: efficacy, so PPE and specifying a certain
micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one, you know, kind of some things
that came out of last night were,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, helpful in kind of modifying
this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a suggestion for doing a
certain percentage of the wattage to leave
[SPEAKER_05]: some exemptions for, you know,
particular purpose lights like for
[SPEAKER_05]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or other things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will likely be built in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so then we also have kind of
some typical product types there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some existing codes that exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Massachusetts, Illinois,
Denver, and Washington state,
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts and Illinois going with a
lighting power density, Denver and
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington state going with a PPE similar
to what IEC is doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the nice thing about PPE is that it
does, you know, there's not as many issues
[SPEAKER_05]: with how are you going to define canopy,
you know, the loopholes that growers can
[SPEAKER_05]: have to kind of, you know, space their
plants out and do things that we really
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't trying to get them to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the code, but it's ways they can work
around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For dehumidification, there was some
really good discussion on this last night
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've been wanting to establish
a minimum moisture removal efficiency,
[SPEAKER_05]: but based on, you know, where the
industry's at right now and what's
[SPEAKER_05]: available for standards, this may not be
feasible this code cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Colorado actually just put through
some standards for dehumidification
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment that would be a good start right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it specifies, you know, several
different acceptable methods of
[SPEAKER_05]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be modifying this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's a couple of current standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa Rosa having a ventilation rate
requirement, Illinois with their HVAC
[SPEAKER_05]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Circulation fan performance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is to do a minimum CFM per watt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one that, as Nadia pointed
out, is definitely a lower priority as far
[SPEAKER_05]: as energy savings.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the idea is to kind of create a
minimum floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So greenhouse lighting efficacy,
very similar to the warehouse,
[SPEAKER_05]: just, you know, in greenhouse facilities
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other measures, dehumidification
controls circulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dehumidification fans will not be
applicable to greenhouses, just indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an important distinction to
make.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then environmental and irrigation
controls.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of facilities might have most or all
of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really, again, trying to set a
minimum floor, make sure all newly
[SPEAKER_05]: constructed facilities have, you know,
temperature, humidity controls,
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigation controls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and we want everyone here to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sign up for the email updates,
the second public stakeholder meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to everyone that already has
given your feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last night was very productive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I really thank everyone for
staying that extra hour because,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I was happy to get people for
one hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So two was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and you can send comments on code
language to info.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go at title 24 stakeholders and copy
myself on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a few minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody has any questions for our
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great presentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed a little bit of slippage in
language over the course of this event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so controlled environment,
horticulture versus controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if those are small details or
maybe they're big details.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you could comment on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to keep the question on,
you know, are we using the right
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology when we say HVAC in controlled
environment, horticulture, agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take the second one first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have to use the HVAC because as we
look at what these standards are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, it's going to be the heating,
cooling, ventilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's not the D part of
that, but it's implied within the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we don't want to remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep going because it covers
all those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can address the first part.
[SPEAKER_05]: So controlled environment, horticulture,
we had a couple iterations of what the
[SPEAKER_05]: name should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was CEA is another acronym that the
Energy Commission uses frequently.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a conflict there and it was
in a definition that seemed to really get
[SPEAKER_05]: narrow in on the facilities we were
looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do understand that there's,
you know, a little bit of industry
[SPEAKER_05]: terminology differences there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there were some specific reasons we
had to go with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said technically agriculture includes
animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the reasons on the
national model code level that that IECC
[SPEAKER_03]: 2021 proposal is indoor horticulture
lights, not just agriculture, specifically
[SPEAKER_03]: for plant applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it also says it a little further
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kyle, is floriculture in CEH?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there flower production in California?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it covered under horticulture?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that double ended HPS lamp efficacy
that shows up in the DOE 2017 report.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's bare lamp,
but it's certainly not fixture efficacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: The highest I've ever seen is like 1.72
when I tested it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems sort of like an outlier
compared to the others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks to address the first part.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as floriculture, yes, so all crops
are considered for indoor and for
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine the greenhouses will have the
higher percentage of the floriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will be just the lighting measure
and the envelope.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the envelope is only for conditioned
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the definition of conditioned in title
24 part six is five BTUs per hour per
[SPEAKER_05]: square foot of mechanical cooling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not evaporative cooling, but like AC
and then 10 BTUs per hour per square foot
[SPEAKER_05]: of heating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering if we're, you know,
since we're expanding title 24 and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: expanding building codes to nominally
cover horticulture, are we now considering
[SPEAKER_04]: that all greenhouses are now going to be
real buildings with real codes about how
[SPEAKER_04]: they're built and and that we're going to
be going down that path as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a, as a kind of follow up question
to that, are we also looking at other
[SPEAKER_04]: types of industrial facilities like car
plants and are we going to have a special
[SPEAKER_04]: code for car plants and a special code for
paint factories and a special code for all
[SPEAKER_04]: of these other kinds of buildings that are
really purpose built and that might not
[SPEAKER_04]: have that same level of customer ignorance
when they get sold or when they get
[SPEAKER_04]: rented?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as I'll start with, you know,
the different processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some processes that are
already covered within title 24 part six,
[SPEAKER_05]: refrigerated warehouses, compressed air,
parking lot, lightings, and there's a few
[SPEAKER_05]: others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that may grow, but this isn't the first
time that that's been done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been done since 2008.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are several other processes that
are involved in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as, you know, how deep the energy
commission will dive into greenhouses in
[SPEAKER_05]: subsequent code cycles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't necessarily comment on,
on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as far as what we're looking at
now with greenhouse lighting and the
[SPEAKER_05]: envelope, you know, that's, that's as far
as we will go in this code cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I just can't comment any further
on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought it up the other night,
but how would you see the policing of
[SPEAKER_06]: something under the DLC requirement being,
you know, anything, let's say it's at 1.6,
[SPEAKER_06]: anything between 1.6 and the DLC minimum,
because there's no independent third party
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, if you can just speak to any
preliminary thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a great, great question,
Brady.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is, you know, something we're
currently considering how to deal with
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one, one possible solution is to
characterize the existing incumbent
[SPEAKER_05]: technologies that, that fall, you know,
below that, that threshold and aren't on
[SPEAKER_05]: the DLC qualified products list.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that, that could be one,
and then adding a table to the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the building code so that there is
accepted, you know, PPE ratings for those
[SPEAKER_05]: particular technologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: There, there is some complexity to that
because you're going to have to look at,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, some different variations of
reflectors and, you know, of course single
[SPEAKER_05]: ended versus double ended.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I see those as almost a different
fixture, even though they can both be high
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also making sure those are well
vetted with the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, making sure that those are
industry accepted numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that's one possible method.
[SPEAKER_05]: Independent testing is another that's got
its own stickiness to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple possible solutions.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is at least a standard to test
to at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's give a hand to our panel.
