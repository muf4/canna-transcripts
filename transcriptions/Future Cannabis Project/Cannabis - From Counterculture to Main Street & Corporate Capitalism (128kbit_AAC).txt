[SPEAKER_06]: I'm David Bienenstok, apparently a
professional stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to think of myself a bit more as a
journalist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been covering cannabis, I am a
stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been covering cannabis for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big period of time for cannabis,
a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_06]: I now write a lot for Leafly and I have a
podcast called Great Moments in Weed
[SPEAKER_06]: History with Abdullah and Bean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spoiler alert, I'm Bean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another guy is Abdullah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited for the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna introduce everybody in a second
and then they can, of course, educate and
[SPEAKER_06]: entertain us all.
[SPEAKER_06]: The panel, as promised, is called From
Counterculture to Main Street,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm actually gonna rename it because I
don't think that's what we're facing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we're facing is from
counterculture to corporate capitalism.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I look at what's going on with
cannabis, I see the counterculture and
[SPEAKER_06]: Main Street on one side.
[SPEAKER_06]: We share a lot of the same values and I
see corporate cannabis as this new entity
[SPEAKER_06]: and where things are actually moving and I
think that we all have to be realistic
[SPEAKER_06]: about what that means.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to say everything bad that's been
happening to small businesses and small
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers in this country over the last 50
years is happening to cannabis all at once
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anybody who doesn't know what I
mean by that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's pretty powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know that that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even need to explain to you the
market forces that are at work,
[SPEAKER_06]: but this is our community and our movement
and it doesn't have to go that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that idea of that we're moving to
Main Street is not really where we're
[SPEAKER_06]: moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're moving to corporate capitalism,
so let's be honest about that and let's be
[SPEAKER_06]: honest about Wall Street and what their
values are.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of talk as we approached
legalization, hands up if you've heard
[SPEAKER_06]: this one, Wall Street and big business are
gonna legitimize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bullshit, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody disagree?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis, incredibly legitimate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wall Street and big business, not such a
good record.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we have to ask ourselves as these
two forces meet, cannabis and free market
[SPEAKER_06]: capitalism as it's practiced in the United
States at least, is it going to add to our
[SPEAKER_06]: culture?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to add to the values of this
point plant or is it going to be an
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just up in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows Humboldt County?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's the heart and soul,
the whole emerald triangle, everybody,
[SPEAKER_06]: but really the heart and soul.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the industries that have been
there before?
[SPEAKER_06]: Timber and fishing, they're extraction
industries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not there anymore because they
took all the trees and they took all the
[SPEAKER_06]: fish and what they left behind was poor
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor people who turned to this plant,
turned to cannabis and found a new way of
[SPEAKER_06]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well now we're facing another extraction
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is renewable, you have to keep
growing it, but what they're extracting is
[SPEAKER_06]: market share.
[SPEAKER_06]: What they're extracting is the value of
this plant only in terms of money and we
[SPEAKER_06]: have to place that value differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me introduce the panel and I'll just
say my first question to them is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be how do we balance these things?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we make sure that the roots culture
of cannabis that we all love and that saw
[SPEAKER_06]: us through this prohibition survives and
how do we make sure that the communities
[SPEAKER_06]: that have been targeted by this
prohibition disproportionately put in
[SPEAKER_06]: prison, had their families torn apart,
how do we open a door for them and not
[SPEAKER_06]: just let all the market share and all the
capital flow to people who frankly already
[SPEAKER_06]: have way too much money and way too much
power and not a good track record of using
[SPEAKER_06]: it?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be my first question,
but let me introduce everybody and then
[SPEAKER_06]: they can weigh in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin Calvino is the founder of the
Mendocino Appalachians Project and the
[SPEAKER_06]: co-founder of the Emerald Exchange.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sits on the board of directors of the
California Growers Association as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: the Mendocino County Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin also founded Green Goat Cooperative
in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt Stang, raise your hand, started
working at High Times Magazine in 2003 as
[SPEAKER_06]: an intern and is currently the company's
chief revenue officer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, he moved up.
[SPEAKER_06]: For almost 20 years he has met and
interacted with nearly everyone in the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis community and his expertise
includes marketing, branding, business
[SPEAKER_06]: development, event production and product
viability.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I love about this panel is it
shows everyone coming from different
[SPEAKER_06]: directions all have a place in this
community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brett Leonard has been at the forefront of
the digital media revolution for over 25
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it be the director writer of the
groundbreaking cult classic film Lawn
[SPEAKER_06]: Mower Man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, woo!
[SPEAKER_06]: Which introduced the concept of virtual
reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reality of popular culture or being
the first to pioneer modern stereoscopic
[SPEAKER_06]: techniques and photorealistic CGI in his
IMAX film T-Rex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nicole West has over 10 years of
experience in the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_06]: has had success in 45 plus cannabis
business applications, opened 20 retail
[SPEAKER_06]: locations in four states, overseen over
$200 million in sales and has helped scale
[SPEAKER_06]: over 150,000 square feet of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, Rebecca, is it Gaska?
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have just gone for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rebecca Gaska is a cannabis business and
government affairs strategist whose drug
[SPEAKER_06]: policy experience began in 2008 as the
first in-house lobbyist for the ACLU of
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevada and she is the founder of Pistol
and Stigma which works to bridge the gap
[SPEAKER_06]: between policy makers and the emerging
cannabis industry which is definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: something we're going to get into.
[SPEAKER_06]: But why don't we start closest to me and
we'll move down the line a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just general thoughts on, as I say,
this intersection between cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: capitalism, what's to be gained,
what are the dangers and how do we as a
[SPEAKER_06]: community respond to what can be an
existential threat and as we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_06]: the marketplace, a huge number of
businesses not able to compete on what's
[SPEAKER_06]: not really a fair playing field in many
ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, I've been connected to
all of this ever since my film was rated
[SPEAKER_03]: as one of the top 10 stoner films of all
time by Premier Magazine a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've constantly been connected to being
a stoner professional like you are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: context of being a filmmaker and someone
who also is a cannabis enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you that the more weed I
smoked on the films I made, the more
[SPEAKER_03]: successful that film was and that
literally is a true statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond that, in context of your question,
I feel there's a platonic responsibility
[SPEAKER_03]: for those of us that are global
storytellers to tell stories, to shift the
[SPEAKER_03]: narrative around cannabis culture to make
it much more inclusive and more expanded
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of the ghetto ization that it has
been given by most of Hollywood content
[SPEAKER_03]: and most content in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there's nothing wrong with stoner
comedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a few very funny ones and
good ones, but that is not the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: story.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, it's the tiniest
sliver of the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at my company, Studio Lightship,
we are very much embedding in many of our
[SPEAKER_03]: IP, our creative projects, which by the
way, encompass what we call VX story
[SPEAKER_03]: worlds, virtual experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I call VX.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's V-R-A-R-M-R.
[SPEAKER_03]: At their core, but are also feature films,
digital content, television content,
[SPEAKER_03]: ARG, and finally at the core, virtual
story worlds.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that, as a storyteller, now as I call
myself Story Worlder, we are embedding
[SPEAKER_03]: positive, truthful mythology around what
this is as a culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs to lead the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Storytelling has always led the way in
terms of the steering of the zeitgeist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now there is, as we all know,
there has been a disinformation narrative
[SPEAKER_03]: going on around cannabis culture for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been stepped up with the
increasing success of the new business
[SPEAKER_03]: models.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, that's one of the things
that's creating the corporatization
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's this feeling like you
can't actually address the core soul of
[SPEAKER_03]: what this is about, which is health,
healing, and actually a mind medicine for
[SPEAKER_03]: the planet that is unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unprecedented in human history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that narrative and that story is
something I'm committed to telling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that that is one of the
first steps that has to happen for popular
[SPEAKER_03]: adoption of really understanding what is
at the core of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's important to note that
this isn't a binary.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an us versus them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the longer that that sort
of framework is extended, the more of a
[SPEAKER_07]: disservice we're doing to ourselves as
advocates, as people who care about
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, as business owners, as parents,
as scientists, because you can't look at
[SPEAKER_07]: this through a dichotomous lens.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a lobbyist, somebody who comes from
drug policy and criminal justice reform,
[SPEAKER_07]: who's a civil libertarian at heart,
like I know that the only way that I was
[SPEAKER_07]: ever able to move the ball down the court
was because I reached across aisles
[SPEAKER_07]: talking to people even when they thought
they weren't gonna agree with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is how you change the storyline.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is how you touch minds and hearts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it takes everybody to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's most interesting to me is since I
left and I started Pistol and Stigma,
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked with people who have been long
time growers who were arguably incredibly
[SPEAKER_07]: successful, but they don't know how to
create rules to the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what you can do when you are a
proactive advocate and lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_07]: You rewrite the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're doing in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thankfully, I had a very fortunate
opportunity as a lobbyist for the ACLU
[SPEAKER_07]: where I got entrenched into the actual
institutional side of rule writing,
[SPEAKER_07]: policy making, where I got to see how easy
it actually was to be able to shift the
[SPEAKER_07]: narrative once you were there and you were
applying yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been lucky that I've been able to
take that same experience and apply it
[SPEAKER_07]: from state to state with clients now
across the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be able to take what has otherwise
been institutional capital and teach my
[SPEAKER_07]: clients, like okay, you come from this
banking world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You come from this business world that is
very, very different than how the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry has worked thus far.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can take your capital and I can
apply it in meaningful ways to right some
[SPEAKER_07]: of those wrongs of the criminalized
aspects of the industry and teach people
[SPEAKER_07]: how to otherwise participate on a social
justice level that they've never had the
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity before because they've been
working through this blinded set of their
[SPEAKER_07]: own business functions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I get to pull them into the
cannabis industry and be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to work with people who care.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But it does take reaching across the
aisle.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does take saying, okay, you might have
a different history than I do,
[SPEAKER_07]: but let's talk about how we can co-create
this now moving forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And does it take a lot of money?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not easy to build a business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I learned that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little guy still, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: My firm has learned the hard way,
like how to do business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I come from a nonprofit background,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But gracefully, I am learning from my own
clients and I'm learning from the
[SPEAKER_07]: engagements that I have from state to
state.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I just want to stress that this
is not us versus them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all a part of this now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to just make a quick point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a big distinction to be
made between ending the war on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: ending the arrests, ending this incredibly
oppressive system.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's winning the war.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now what we're talking about is
winning the peace, which is the economic
[SPEAKER_06]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people out here are small
cannabis business owners or small growers?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many of you feel that the rules of
the game are fair?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that speaks kind of volumes to
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that's the mentality.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to pat ourselves on the back
really hard for ending this incredibly
[SPEAKER_06]: oppressive system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have to be realistic about what
we're up against.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'm hearing is an extinction
level event for these small business
[SPEAKER_06]: owners and for these small farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't mean bad intentions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means we're taking a system that exists
that existed outside of mainstream
[SPEAKER_06]: capitalism and pushing it into that
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to be honest about what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of wanted to parlay off of both
of them in my opinions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's because I have two different
places that I come from in this space.
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 years ago, I was one of the first
lottery winners in the city of Long Beach,
[SPEAKER_08]: in this beautiful city that we're all in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, I am not a license holder in
the city of Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_08]: I invested a little over a quarter of a
million dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: We played two leases for almost two years
to go through the process.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a location for those of you who are
familiar with the city of Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was over off of Studebaker in spring
right across from the El Dorado disc golf
[SPEAKER_08]: course.
[SPEAKER_08]: This upset some council members within the
city at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were able to overturn the ordinance
after they took all of my money,
[SPEAKER_08]: made me relocate and add parks to the
ordinance after the fact, thus zoning me
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the process of me losing my entire life
at the youngest business owner in my
[SPEAKER_08]: family, I felt vindicated to fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're warriors in this fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: The answer is I have to fight and stand up
against this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I fought.
[SPEAKER_08]: I fought for almost a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had all my friends and family that
worked for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was receiving $1,000 a day fine to
myself and $1,000 fine a day to my
[SPEAKER_08]: landlord.
[SPEAKER_08]: My landlord was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, keep paying the bills and I'll
let you stay as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at a certain point when the police are
harassing your customers, you decide to
[SPEAKER_08]: shut down your business.
[SPEAKER_08]: My customers were getting tickets.
[SPEAKER_08]: My employees were getting their cars
towed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it became a full on harassment
from the Long Beach PD.
[SPEAKER_08]: I eventually decided I'm gonna shut down,
but I had fought for too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: That process of fighting for so long in
this new ordinance when the city of Long
[SPEAKER_08]: Beach got all those people that were able
to get priority points, because I fought
[SPEAKER_08]: for what we stood up for, I lost my
ability to apply for a priority license
[SPEAKER_08]: when Long Beach did their licensing
process last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was required to go into the process
of priority three section even though they
[SPEAKER_08]: had taken my entire life from me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I say my entire life,
I literally mean my entire life from all
[SPEAKER_08]: of the money I had to my car.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fast forward 10 years, I moved to Colorado
because obviously California wasn't ready
[SPEAKER_08]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked for a bunch of companies and I'm
now back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just started a marketing and branding
company, but I do, also I do advisement
[SPEAKER_08]: for investment firms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my main piece of that is from the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to claim myself as a fairy godmother
of cannabis because I want the people who
[SPEAKER_08]: are coming into this looking for money to
know what the heck they're asking for,
[SPEAKER_08]: to know what they're signing up for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for me and for any of you out there
who have that bit of knowledge,
[SPEAKER_08]: who have the ability to impart this
information to your friends, you owe it to
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_08]: You owe it to them so that they can make
wise money decisions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because so many of us have been living in
shoe boxes of cash, having no interest in
[SPEAKER_08]: even being able to talk to a bank.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the people who are most experienced in
this business, have no financial
[SPEAKER_08]: understanding of what it even means to
look at a banker and say, here's my money.
[SPEAKER_08]: They get nervous when they walk into the
bank to cash a personal check.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of these people are still coming
out of their PTSDs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're one of those people who is
coming from the other side, some of my
[SPEAKER_08]: best mentors right now are people that
have no interaction with cannabis outside
[SPEAKER_08]: of the fact that they believe in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're coming in from banking.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're coming in from finance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm connecting with these people that
understand that this is a movement and
[SPEAKER_08]: that people's lives are being changed by
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for me, I say if you have the
ability to impart knowledge to one of your
[SPEAKER_08]: farmer friends or extractor friends who's
been crushing at what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_08]: but maybe have not been able to use a bank
or ever ask for money.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you've been in the industry for
more than five years, you've never even
[SPEAKER_08]: considered going to a bank to be like,
hey, can I have a million dollars?
[SPEAKER_08]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that reality, we've never even read
a book, most of the people, to understand
[SPEAKER_08]: what most of these terms mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at the Boston Freedom Rally and I
told people there's a book called
[SPEAKER_08]: Investment Terms for Dummies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know it seems silly, but read it
before you go talk to some money people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And something as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to educate ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those of us who are already
educated, who are making the way,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's your duty to help those people that
you know deserve to have a space in this
[SPEAKER_08]: industry to fight for that and to educate
your people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for anybody who's not aware,
due to cannabis being federally illegal,
[SPEAKER_06]: that prevents not just banking,
but getting a bank loan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've had a successful business for 10
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your books are great to the extent that
you could show them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're denied the money to grow your
business, to compete, and yet somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: with private equity can come in with 100
times your money.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can make 15 fuck-ups and still win,
where you get one chance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all too often they turn around
and say, well, these donors just don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know how to run a business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what you're saying is there
are people of good intention coming in
[SPEAKER_06]: with the values of the plant and we want
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the question is, are you going to add
something or are you just going to
[SPEAKER_06]: extract?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people had any trouble getting
cannabis in California 10 years ago?
[SPEAKER_06]: We know how to grow and distribute
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need private equity to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's take that off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are you going to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who knows me knows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty much all I talk about all
day long, like every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't drop an expletive there,
but capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a word before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck is the word he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, last year I said write as relative and
capitalism is messed up at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I dealt with Hezekiah said,
like, oh my God, I can't believe you said
[SPEAKER_00]: that on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're having a full on discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the evolution of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finally tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an us versus them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capitalism is an it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to bed easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell my children they can and
can't do things that we could and couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you know,
I moved into a beautiful region to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: my family the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm watching people who have never
touched cannabis before taking market
[SPEAKER_00]: share, dropping us down two thirds,
making things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the recriminalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got recriminalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got put into a separate category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, they're like,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take it from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good capitalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this is our chance while we're
still having this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this conversation continues to
actually take the main stage that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and speak out against what we're doing to
the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are shipping capitalism around the
whole planet and we're getting to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually getting to experience at a
small scale producers that can tell this
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell the story of how, you know,
yesterday I could buy groceries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week, I'm probably going to be on
food stamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to be working for
someone and that and then keep on and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: on and keep on losing farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends, my neighbors, everyone that I
turn to has a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've become a grief counselor on my ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even an activist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that we as, you know,
we as small scale producers have a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: is is like sort of like a it's like a myth
and a hero's journey, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like it's the only thing now
that we can do the show the world that
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's a breath left in humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the idea that we are actually
seeing people like come in well funded
[SPEAKER_00]: with twenty million dollars to buy shelf
space to push small producers off the
[SPEAKER_00]: market like and we're and we're applauding
these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cooking them dinners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're throwing events for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're letting them sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's it's beyond ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like and then now we're funding water
infrastructure being stolen from Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California, shipped down to the desert to
build billions of dollars of
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure to build a new agricultural
industry where there was none.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so like I don't like I could talk
for like days and days and days probably
[SPEAKER_00]: like to zero point and no end because I
think at the end of the day like as as
[SPEAKER_00]: depressed as I get it's like I'm also just
as hopeful and happy that we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hopeful and happy that we can
decentralize agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy we're having a collective and
cooperative conversation about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if I was to say something
about the segue is it like work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every single one of us like band
together, sign JVs, you know, create
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperatives, you know, don't sell to
Canadian companies just because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: offering you hella money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, give that IP to your
neighbor, you know, and your neighbor's
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor and continue that pattern
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna keep on talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get one more quick show of hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who here in their hearts loves coal more
than they love cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, nobody but and this is with full
respect to people who work in that
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we hear oh my god, we're gonna lose
coal jobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though we know that industry is
polluting the planet potentially into a
[SPEAKER_06]: catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_06]: We collectively act like it's the biggest
emergency that ever fucking happened on
[SPEAKER_06]: planet Earth is we have to save these coal
jobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have 60,000 small cannabis
farmers in this state alone and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: facing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to react I would say even more
robustly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, fuck coal.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fuck coal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it is kind of a terrible
polluting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the Joseph Campbell hero's journey
reference.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everyone here is here because
they're on their own hero's journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think part of this whole thing,
part of this legalization thing that's
[SPEAKER_05]: happening is we're bringing together the
people who thought we were 15 years ago
[SPEAKER_05]: when I was at high times and I told people
I was at high times, they would be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: that is fucking disgusting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You dirty stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they're like, hey, can I pick your
brain about CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know anything about this weed
business?
[SPEAKER_05]: What about these Canadian stocks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything going on that I should
know about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, is this the craziest thing that's
ever happened?
[SPEAKER_05]: And while there is a lot of negativity
around it, there's also a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: positivity because we have a moment now
and being, I love you, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_05]: the war is over.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we're fighting for the peace
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think we're fighting the war.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am very, very strongly that we have
not won, that there's still large parts of
[SPEAKER_05]: this country that are not, that people are
still going to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I went to jail and people are going
to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I sat in jail for five days with the
federal government and it fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if any of you have done that,
it's the worst thing in the entire fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything that you can do to get
yourself out of that situation to stop the
[SPEAKER_05]: people from arresting us for cannabis,
I am supportive of.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like John Boehner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he was a fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact that he's on Kevin's board
now is a huge movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that Mitch McConnell signed off
on the farm bill because a couple people I
[SPEAKER_05]: know went in and lobbied the fuck out of
him for their farms in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all of this aside, people should not
be going to jail for a fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody in here, I hope everybody in
here agrees with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we got to win the war first before
we win the peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that really does involve money because
this country, it's a fucked up system,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's our system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, yes, everyone here should be
agitating to change the system,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we also have to change the fact that
we're going to fucking jail for weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that there's eight great states that
have legalized it, but there's still
[SPEAKER_05]: people going to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people getting hit in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know someone who went to jail three
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might have been shipping weed
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But fuck that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're still going to jail here in
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it require?
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires all of these wonderful people
in Congress who you maybe would never want
[SPEAKER_05]: to share a fucking joint with,
but you definitely want them to vote on
[SPEAKER_05]: our side.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need the state's bill to pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need all of these fucking bills to pass
so that people stop going to jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my position, the same one that
we had, me and Bean worked together for
[SPEAKER_05]: many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had this conversation many times,
smoking joints, playing ping pong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to win the war first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like idealism is amazing and it's great,
but I don't want anyone to ever go to jail
[SPEAKER_05]: again for weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that requires some money and some
people with their power to be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, guy who works with me on these
projects, vote differently because I gave
[SPEAKER_05]: you X dollars for your last campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the shitty system that we're
in, but it's the system we're in and we
[SPEAKER_05]: need to fucking win this war.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can fight about how to make it better,
but right now it is still, there is still
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of thousands of people going to
jail every year for smoking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: for distributing cannabis, for bringing
cannabis somewhere, for whatever the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: does.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, you are now in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are stripped of your freedom,
your rights, your voting rights.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're no longer a human being.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we don't stop that, if we don't
first of all stop that and then get into
[SPEAKER_05]: the, yes, we need to change the rest of
the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you shouldn't be killing small farms
to go and build a fucking private equity
[SPEAKER_05]: thing in the desert.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit is, I'm sorry to any of you who
are running a giant facility in the
[SPEAKER_05]: desert.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, no insult meant, but like,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 400,000 square feet in the desert
with no water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, I'm going to grow tons of
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you not going up to a place where
it's wet all the time and perfect and
[SPEAKER_05]: just, just work with the people who have
their setups there and help them get
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed and give them some money and then
make money off of that rather than some
[SPEAKER_05]: absurd gleaming desert dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grabbed the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel very passionately that if we
don't fight for the end of the war on
[SPEAKER_05]: drugs, we can't fight for the peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not done.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are like, people are like,
oh, it's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, he can, with a stroke of the
pen, Donald Trump could fucking arrest all
[SPEAKER_05]: of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every one of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still not done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we need to finish that off and
then we can all deal with the remnants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like first, don't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I just absolutely don't go to jail
and don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first responsibility of any
revolutionary is not to get caught.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can arrest you if you don't get
caught.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I hope it's pretty obvious that,
you know, I've dedicated my professional
[SPEAKER_06]: career to that idea that we need to end
this war on people, ultimately on
[SPEAKER_06]: marginalized people specifically.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think that the two ideas are
mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea that we work to end this
oppressive system, but that we don't give
[SPEAKER_06]: over our values and our community to these
moneyed interests along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's ever a right time to
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think there's ever a wrong
time to stand up for what you value and
[SPEAKER_06]: what you believe in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, to me, that's a false
choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to put all these farmers out
of business and we don't have to put all
[SPEAKER_06]: these mom and pop true believer people who
put their asses on the line and many of
[SPEAKER_06]: whom went to prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to push them out into the
street and push them back into the black
[SPEAKER_06]: market in order to win.
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither political party backed us and we
still won.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took on the criminal justice system.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took on the medical system.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took on the establishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took on both political parties.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took on the public and propaganda and
we won and we did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the politicians came along for the
ride once we proved that this was a
[SPEAKER_06]: winning issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't lead and it wasn't a bribe.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was us that changed and ended this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, if we give over to the idea
that it was some outside benevolent force,
[SPEAKER_06]: that did it, we lose our agency and we
lose our sense of community and we become
[SPEAKER_06]: sharecroppers to corporate America.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not my vision and I think
there's no wrong time to start pushing
[SPEAKER_06]: back against that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which gets to my next question for the
panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we really can't look at big business to
change outside of its own best interests,
[SPEAKER_06]: the economic fight is on very difficult
terrain, but the culture fight is one that
[SPEAKER_06]: we can win.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we, and Brett, this is a great
question to start with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we educate consumers who will
ultimately vote with their dollars to
[SPEAKER_06]: support the kind of businesses and the
kind of business practices that make this
[SPEAKER_06]: such an amazing and valuable community?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got to entertain people in
our culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just call it education.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't just be set in this sort of dry
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be something that is done in a
way that moves emotion on a mass scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's incumbent upon
storytellers to tell better, more powerful
[SPEAKER_03]: stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe, as Rebecca said,
the core thing here is to not polarize.
[SPEAKER_03]: The greater narrative that this all fits
into is the greater narrative we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: experiencing in American culture and many
ways globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: In global culture right now, writ large.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a time of separation and dividing
and pitting things against each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as we push against that with our
stories and push against it in a way that
[SPEAKER_03]: creates the war, and it is a war.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally agree we haven't won the war.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as we push against that that way,
we're gonna get that same resistance back,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes even more powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have to find a clever way of
shifting the overall mass perception.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is not playing to our own room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ghettoizing it to be something
that is just for those of us that know and
[SPEAKER_03]: are the smart stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's so many ways that elitism
creeps into every group, into every fight,
[SPEAKER_03]: into every revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can't happen here because the
truth is the core and soul of this plant
[SPEAKER_03]: is for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that creates so many ways
of making your life better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not just about getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one tiny little aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that larger story and the ability to
shift it from the polarization,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's where the answer lies,
to start moving the body politic and the
[SPEAKER_03]: group zeitgeist in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree that this is a global
phenomenon, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This stupid war on drugs has really
divided us in ways that are so beyond
[SPEAKER_07]: unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not just California, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously, look at things from a
state to state level, but look at things
[SPEAKER_07]: from a country to country level,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: The US has been throwing its weight around
for far too long in criminalizing
[SPEAKER_07]: consumption on a global scale of one of
the most powerfully medicinal plants that,
[SPEAKER_07]: again, that we know of.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, that's just one of,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Coca.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can go on to other psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plants are powerful, and that was
realized.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the core of this war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heaven forbid, you know, people get along.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because then the military industrial
complex.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could go on on that forever and ever,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, I really think this comes down
to popularizing some stories, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is what happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we saw with Charlotte's Web,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sanjay Gupta, Weeds, all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you move emotions.
[SPEAKER_07]: You move people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get people to start seeing,
like, oh, you know, this is like a gay
[SPEAKER_07]: marriage, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Gay marriage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh, I actually have a cousin
who's gay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of a sudden, it's not that
terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, my mom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her, like, retirement community ladies are
like, oh, we want to know what this CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: is, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we heard this could help.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you take those opportunities,
and you start educating people where
[SPEAKER_07]: they're at.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's been the problem, I think,
for so long in this work that we've done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been disparate, disparate messaging,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're not starting where other
people are coming from, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people, excuse me, some assholes
don't care that black and brown people
[SPEAKER_07]: have been going to jail.
[SPEAKER_07]: They still don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: We might never convince them otherwise
that that is actually a real fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we start to educate them where they're
at with grandma, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: With their grandchildren who have autism.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you start looking at it from
different angles because this cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: plant is actually a dodecahedron,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It is immensely powerful, and it can touch
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I truly believe Ethan Russo's theory
of the endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we have been living for way
too long with not enough cannabis to treat
[SPEAKER_07]: our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I know that's, like,
a heady idea for most people, but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: natural food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let thy food be thy medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there are a lot of different
ways, essentially, to story tell this,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're all responsible in different
ways for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to make it more successful
commercially in this form, because we are
[SPEAKER_03]: in the system we're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in a capitalist society.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't deny that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, every business that gets to this
point of, you know, these inflection
[SPEAKER_03]: points, suddenly the giant money comes in,
and those players come in on every single
[SPEAKER_03]: vertical you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is not a new story.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's really a much larger thing
that I think this is perfectly emblematic
[SPEAKER_03]: of, and we can make it the emblem of
smaller is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it literally will connect directly
to better healing, better lifestyle,
[SPEAKER_03]: better wellness, better joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we can tell that story and make
people understand it, then this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yet again, my answer is kind of a
combination of both of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The entertainment factor is huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: My example on that is my grandmother.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told my grandma I was a day trader for
the first five years of being in this
[SPEAKER_08]: business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told her I sold commodities,
which to this day I still believe is
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty much the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the process, my grandma found out
it was the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was destroying my grandfather's life
because he was dying, and I was sneaking
[SPEAKER_08]: him edibles so that he could live the end
of his life in a good way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to destroy my grandfather's
life who was in a wheelchair, and he was
[SPEAKER_08]: going to wheel himself out on the Long
Beach Boulevard looking for some crack or
[SPEAKER_08]: something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I was the devil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And since the education factor,
you know, I could have done the most.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried to tell my grandma I had booklets
and I had information, but the
[SPEAKER_08]: entertainment factor and the entertainment
piece got my grandma.
[SPEAKER_08]: She watched a few of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really changed her in a big way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the next piece of getting to
people where they are, I agree,
[SPEAKER_08]: and yes, like educating my grandma was
huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's the person that shows up and votes
every single time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But local government, people forget how
easy it is to become a city council
[SPEAKER_08]: member.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that not to say like it's the
easiest thing in the world, but it's not
[SPEAKER_08]: like becoming president.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you can make a difference in your
local community, and even if you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: going to become a city council member,
to get to those people where they are,
[SPEAKER_08]: because most people who go into politics
want to continue in politics, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like nobody starts as a mayor and is like,
yeah, this is it, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most mayors want to go on into Congress or
something higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we start on a level where they're
actually listening to us and they kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: still have to listen to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: As just a person that shows up to city
council and waits for your three minutes,
[SPEAKER_08]: you get to speak to them where they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we can start at an early stage in
their political development and help
[SPEAKER_08]: educate people politically early on,
before they become your president,
[SPEAKER_08]: side note on that, but no.
[SPEAKER_08]: But before they become a governor or a
congressman or somebody who has political
[SPEAKER_08]: experience, before that happens,
if we could get to them where they are as
[SPEAKER_08]: a city council member or as a mayor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor Robert Garcia was here this morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: You had a chance to speak with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was going through the city of Long
Beach drama, he was a council member.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in his office.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's heard my issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had one on one meetings.
[SPEAKER_08]: And not to say that I changed his mind,
but all of us helped him understand where
[SPEAKER_08]: now you have a mayor who supports this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all got to somebody where he was and
was able to really help educate a council
[SPEAKER_08]: member who then went on to be mayor who's
now much more powerful and is allowing for
[SPEAKER_08]: things to happen that I don't know would
have happened without Mayor Robert Garcia.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's kind of a combination.
[SPEAKER_08]: The entertainment gets the voters to
listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: The voting age in a big way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And talking to people where they are,
we can bring people into politics knowing
[SPEAKER_08]: about how amazing cannabis is rather than
trying to convince somebody who's been
[SPEAKER_08]: doing their job for 30 years and has
already kind of put the cloak over their
[SPEAKER_08]: eyes that this is a drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of these people still really do
believe that there's a war on cannabis out
[SPEAKER_08]: there and they need to fight against us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because yeah, the war's not over.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is still very real.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would say entertain and talk to your
local teams, your local governments.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, especially when we talk about the
equity.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's locally being done because local
governments did realize that this is a
[SPEAKER_08]: problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: That people have been going to jail for
this by being racially profiled.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And local governments, the state
understands that it's a thing,
[SPEAKER_08]: but local governments are choosing to
enact their equity programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's because somebody talked to
their local government and said this has
[SPEAKER_08]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they want to make change.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am really excited to hear Kat speak,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's somebody that is really
interesting right now, if you guys aren't
[SPEAKER_08]: familiar with Kat Packer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But following the equity movement in LA
has been really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm proud of what's happening right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin, I think that the Appalachian
program that you could speak on is one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the great things to come out of Prop 64 to
help us educate these consumers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is rapidly becoming my favorite panel
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a moderator that allows us to
drop F-bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a capitalist bashing session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of your panelists just dropped
dodecahedron on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so basically, I'm kind of
cheating here because I live in a region
[SPEAKER_00]: that is steeped in heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a legacy of small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day is a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we do is a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is a story that replicates
what's been going on for almost five
[SPEAKER_00]: decades in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the edutainment or however we want to
call it, where we're actually educating
[SPEAKER_00]: people while having fun is what we're
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Northern California,
that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up there to basically become small
farmers, raise our families a certain way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, in developing the Mendocino
Appalachians project, realizing that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of resource mapping, community resource
mapping, economic development,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that no one in their right mind
would stick a commodities grow two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours on the backside of a mountain
down a windy road where two cars going
[SPEAKER_00]: down at the same time, passing each other
almost created off of a cliff makes
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely no sense to a commodities
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we have in that region is tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we have is our story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we have is our quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to tell the story of the breeding to
tell the story of the communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell the story of the heritage in that
region is not only our right, is not only
[SPEAKER_00]: our saving grace, but it's also our gift
to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we are creating a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everyone here familiar with
Appalachians of origin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, similar to wine in France,
essentially like Bordeaux, champagne.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Northern California and Mendocino,
we developed a map that's very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: these regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've broken our county up into
multiple regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of those regions has its own
unique heritage, its own unique strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: its own unique communities, and will
eventually create its own unique brand
[SPEAKER_00]: around that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to do this and being able to
split these regions up into these cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: hubs will allow us to distribute our
cannabis at a higher price, remain small,
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperate, know your neighbor,
know your distributor, know your market,
[SPEAKER_00]: come down to Los Angeles like we're doing
right now and actually telling that story
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Emerald Exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to selflessly name drop it,
just like where I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, basically we have these
entertainment events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come down, we tell the story,
we bring the products, we talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: small batch and the lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that, like I said,
I feel like I'm cheating because I just
[SPEAKER_00]: live this life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel so optimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I said, I was kind of depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also just as hopeful because no one
can ever take away our place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one that's ever going to be
able to grow a Comchi Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one ever going to be able to
grow a Spyrock Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these epigenetic expressions are
happening in those regions specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't recreate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really believe that through that
story of cultural heritage that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, I believe we're going to
be all right in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe all of us are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have like 30,000 plus farmers,
but 80% of us, if not more, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: way more than 80% are not legal at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about, I think we have
200 legal cultivation licenses in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino County right now going into the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single gate on my ridge is
locked because there's cannabis behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one ridge I can count over 200
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, by no means is this going to
win it for everyone, but it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: good shot moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of forgot what the question was,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we educate consumers to support
the real grassroots movement of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: that kept this movement going through
prohibition?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't even get stoned today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess here's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in here, there's probably 10 media
companies filming right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's wonderful events.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim is sitting back there from the Emerald
Cup, the Emerald Exchange here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's places that educate both
experience experientially and in written
[SPEAKER_05]: print digital form that are putting out
stories in a great way that they kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: bring that feeling that the cannabis is
normal, that marijuana is safer than
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol, as our friend Mason put it out
there many years ago and helped change the
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the biggest thing that
anyone here can do is tell that story
[SPEAKER_05]: because humans are storytelling people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want to gather around the fire and
listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think back to his Joseph Campbell
reference, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what made this my favorite panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think if you look at it as a way for
people to go and normalize and make
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis not something that's scary or
dirty or makes your grandfather smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: crack, I think there's a lot of things
that you can do just all the people
[SPEAKER_05]: sitting here, all the media companies,
all of the event companies, all these
[SPEAKER_05]: people who are out there telling the
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: This event right here is normalizing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on the Queen Mary.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on a beautiful historic ship in the
middle of Long Beach and having a cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: event with a bunch of tourists walking
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think people seeing that,
it's not scary, that it's not dirty,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's not something that's going to
lead to some terrible other thing which
[SPEAKER_05]: what it's leading to was never that in the
first place, but just convincing people
[SPEAKER_05]: that all of it was propaganda,
that it's all bullshit, that utilizing
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is a right, is a natural
plant-based medicine as there are many
[SPEAKER_05]: other plant-based medicines that are
currently outlawed by the system because
[SPEAKER_05]: they create people who question.
[SPEAKER_05]: They create people who want to understand
more, who want to seek and search.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not good for a controlled
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it really comes down to people
messaging that and creating great content,
[SPEAKER_05]: great events, great other things that you
can interact with and take away and tell
[SPEAKER_05]: that story to your friends and your family
and their friends and their family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you wind up, that's the most powerful
thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: The most powerful thing is not something
someone tells you to do, it's what you
[SPEAKER_05]: feel internally and want to tell everyone
else and you want to give that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's probably the most
powerful thing that people can do here and
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's happening here, it's
happening in other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's events all over the country now
where cannabis is normal and where it
[SPEAKER_05]: feels like something that's just
integrated into normal life and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: probably the best way we can really win
this war in a final way when people are
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I don't believe you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that cannabis is a drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't believe that this is a bad
substance that's gonna hurt people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We win, it's over.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't keep fighting the same war.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, how many people, just to kind of
wrap up on the idea of the media and how
[SPEAKER_06]: we portray ourselves to the people outside
this room, whether they're with us,
[SPEAKER_06]: against us, or curious, how many people
remember when Colorado Legalized shows pot
[SPEAKER_06]: barons of Colorado and marijuana ink and
making a shitload of money off weed and
[SPEAKER_06]: the cash kings of cannabis and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what that was was the corporate
media coming into our world and deciding
[SPEAKER_06]: for us what stories we're gonna tell about
ourselves and they wanted to tell those
[SPEAKER_06]: stories because it lets them off the hook
for being the propaganda wing of
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibition, for convincing for 100 years
everyone in this country that they were
[SPEAKER_06]: right and we were wrong, that we were
people of low value, that we, X,
[SPEAKER_06]: Y, and Z, deserve to go to jail,
basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: The stories that they didn't wanna tell
were about our real community,
[SPEAKER_06]: about our farmers, about our small
business people, about people who'd been
[SPEAKER_06]: trampled by this war.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see a lot of shows like that and
there's a reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: The New York Times didn't endorse
legalization until 2014 that's fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're supposed to be the paper of record.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're supposed to be intelligent people.
[SPEAKER_06]: You couldn't figure that out until 2014.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Denver Post told everybody in an
editorial to vote against legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what they did like three months
later?
[SPEAKER_06]: They started the Cannabis so that they
could cash in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know good people who worked at the
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they put out a great product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not knocking them, but what I'm saying
is that's how this corporate media works.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they see us, same fucking way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what happened to the Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: It got shut down because a bunch of
hedge-funge assholes bought the newspaper
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's what's happening to the media.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how many farmers remember when it
was four or five grand for a pound?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not as old.
[SPEAKER_06]: But two bucks a word used to be a good
rate for a writer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It ain't anymore, let me fucking tell you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The two things that I've worked in my
whole life are the media and Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the influence of corporate America
on both of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you look at your news stories and
you look at your storytellers and you
[SPEAKER_06]: decide what are the stories we're gonna
tell about ourselves and to each other and
[SPEAKER_06]: to the rest of the world, that really
matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Support the kind of media that you believe
in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Support the kind of media that reflects
the values of not just this community but
[SPEAKER_06]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and thank you to our entire
panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a diverse group of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please come up and ask questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please come up and hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry we didn't have a Q&A.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I liked the direction that this panel
headed and I think when we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about small and craft, we can also talk
about small craft events and there's a big
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of, you know it's funny I look at
sort of who puts on events and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: the event later this week in downtown LA,
it's big, it's corporate, it's an event
[SPEAKER_02]: production company that just looks at
industries and says you know the banking
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, there's money to be made
throwing events there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The healthcare industry, let's launch the
healthcare event series.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Cannabis, we can make money there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have people who are doing
sort of the small craft events and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to say it's appreciated that you all
come to events like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely go to the downtown event but
it's important to come show up to events
[SPEAKER_02]: like this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which locally produce event.
[SPEAKER_02]: By a local resident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slash activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so if anyone else have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mentioned about you know people are
still getting arrested over marijuana and
[SPEAKER_01]: we have three strikes law that's still
here which means that if you get arrested
[SPEAKER_01]: for a drug more than three times it's a
felony and if you get arrested for three
[SPEAKER_01]: felonies it's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's pretty horrific
but for the individuals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: incarcerated right now for past marijuana
laws it was just on my mind like is there
[SPEAKER_01]: like thoughts in anybody's minds about you
know like counteracting that because I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that it's a lot of colored people
that are facing that and those are
[SPEAKER_01]: families that are ripped apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean for us now like we all want to
stay out but what about those people that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know have been locked up for years and
years and years over a couple joints?
[SPEAKER_06]: In Prop 64 there are provisions for
expungement of records and for people to
[SPEAKER_06]: petition the government.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not it should be a blanket thing to
just let people out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well no it passed I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: The law that passed has included some of
those provisions and some local
[SPEAKER_06]: communities have chosen to expunge
people's records even automatically.
[SPEAKER_08]: San Francisco like like 500 there was a
number I saw on a paper recently San
[SPEAKER_08]: Francisco let out some several hundred
people that all had previous marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: convictions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know for a fact they've done it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado did it in a big way 2015.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was some like billions of dollars in
savings from letting these people out of
[SPEAKER_08]: jail that they were you know keeping in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again I'm gonna go back to making sure
that we pay attention to local communities
[SPEAKER_08]: because local communities are gonna be
able to push on this like the city of San
[SPEAKER_08]: Francisco was able to.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean people need to start leaning on
Los Angeles and you know Sacramento and
[SPEAKER_08]: these other cities in a way if you have
some involvement in your local communities
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like that's probably one of the
best ways that we can right now because 64
[SPEAKER_08]: did allow for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again similar to the way social equity is
working the communities are going to have
[SPEAKER_08]: to stand up and do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: The state as a whole as it stands right
now is not but if you know San Francisco
[SPEAKER_08]: can do it anybody can.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about a lot about how we can
as citizens at this low level interact
[SPEAKER_04]: with our government officials both from a
city level and state level but there's I
[SPEAKER_04]: feel like another opportunity that we have
to be able to act as private citizens and
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to get the panel's thoughts on
using concepts such as jury nullification
[SPEAKER_04]: to help prevent the conviction of again
like you mentioned people of color who
[SPEAKER_04]: have been unequitably targeted throughout
the drug war.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel that that's something that we
could educate not just here where we have
[SPEAKER_04]: legal markets medicinally and
recreationally but nationwide to help
[SPEAKER_04]: prevent further damage being done to the
equity of those unfortunately targeted
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably don't have a really great
answer for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are several criminal justice reform
groups who theorize and strategize around
[SPEAKER_07]: a question like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that the cannabis industry is
equipped for something as technical but
[SPEAKER_07]: it's certainly a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly juries we do understand are not
representative.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not peers who are convicting
people historically speaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why jury selection is such a
complicated thing and that's why people
[SPEAKER_07]: hire expensive attorneys especially when
they are looking at the threat of going to
[SPEAKER_07]: jail for life if you can afford that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise if you're stuck with a public
defender who has a caseload of 400 the
[SPEAKER_07]: options are much more limited.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's creative.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think stories or ideas like that are
certainly ways in which the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry could contribute in some sort of
reparations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously what we've seen mostly have been
these equity reform projects but I think
[SPEAKER_07]: that's why organizations like the ACLU are
so important in arenas like this because
[SPEAKER_07]: they span.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're intersectional.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's criminal justice reform as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry that's probably not a good answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think to add to what you said I
think the role for the industry in
[SPEAKER_06]: criminal justice reform is to support
criminal justice reform financially and
[SPEAKER_06]: the people who've dedicated their lives to
doing that don't need anything except
[SPEAKER_06]: resources.
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically to jury nullification that
gets a little into the weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad pun is my stock and trade but on the
grander scale if you're making a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: money off of this plant or off of this
community or in a better way if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: making a lot of money with this plant and
with this community and you think to
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself well what good can I do with that
money?
[SPEAKER_06]: Start with criminal justice reform.
[SPEAKER_06]: Start with undoing the damage that we're
doing right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the damage we've done in the past and
there are plenty of organizations that are
[SPEAKER_06]: worthy and willing and ready and already
engaged in that fight and you can support
[SPEAKER_06]: them with your resources.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay that's a great note to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more time thanks to an incredible
panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: you you
