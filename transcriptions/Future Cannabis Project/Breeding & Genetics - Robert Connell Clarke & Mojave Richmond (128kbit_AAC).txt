[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, how long have you guys known
each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when did you, did you first meet in
like the Amsterdam scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I met in Amsterdam in 1993.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the scene like back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who were some of kind of the people
you were running with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I moved to Amsterdam or actually I
originally just planned on touring around
[SPEAKER_04]: Europe and I stopped off in Amsterdam
first.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Adam Dunn, who later formed TH seeds,
he's an old childhood friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known him virtually all my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he had been in Amsterdam for two or
three years at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, hey, you got to come
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're an old, old time cannabis guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to love it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, I go check it out for a
couple of weeks, maybe a month or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I told my family and friends that
I'd be gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Total for a month, minimum, maximum a
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ended up staying for six.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, and I was going to travel all
around Europe and I just traveled through,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Netherlands, Belgium,
and then France, and then decided to come
[SPEAKER_04]: back to Amsterdam and stay there for the
remainder of the six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what in kind of the early to mid
nineties was the state of genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people always talk about,
I always view it like Genghis Khan has
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, you know, he spread his seed all
over the world and like Dutch genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: have kind of cross pollinated with all the
land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was going on in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what were you seeing back in the
early to mid nineties?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I look at Rob because a lot of what
was in Amsterdam at the time were the
[SPEAKER_04]: pivotal varieties that came from
California and ended up such as?
[SPEAKER_04]: Such as haze, skunk one, northern lights,
which didn't come from California,
[SPEAKER_04]: but from the west coast, Afghan one,
Durban poison, early girl, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants like that were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Durban poison came into Amsterdam,
not through South Africa, but through kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of people growing it in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually was collected by Ed Rosenthal
years ago and a coffee shop in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and then those seeds came back to
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things were selected here and multiplied
and then ended up back in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he grabbed them in what decade decade?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been the mid seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and then started growing in California
because I know with Jim Goodwin,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mel Frank, who ended up being the keeper
of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were you doing at this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in 93.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working with Horta Farm and
developing things that ended up being used
[SPEAKER_02]: by GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was the aim at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just beginning Horta Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grew up where?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Adam was lived in Jamestown,
Rhode Island for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam did live in Jamestown for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam, I believe, was born in Woodstock,
New York, and I was born in Big Sur,
[SPEAKER_04]: California, kind of on the opposite ends
of the same spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his family moved to California when he
was a young a young baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we met.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew up in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Big Sur was a kind of a
beatnik artist enclave of people who had
[SPEAKER_04]: gone back to the land to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was cannabis was definitely the one
thing that kind of connected the entire
[SPEAKER_04]: community, you know, whether they were
musicians or artists or cultivators or
[SPEAKER_04]: poets or communists or hippies or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was definitely cannabis was
the connective thing, and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely a part of my life from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about you, Rob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you grow up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born not far from here, Delmar,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sierra, California, boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to school at UC Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where it all began for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when when you both first were
playing around with genetics, what like
[SPEAKER_01]: NorCal, what, 80s and SoCal, probably I
don't want to date you, but like late 60s
[SPEAKER_01]: in the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to school in UC Santa Cruz in 1971.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually technically I did grow up
in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent most of my formative years in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I left Big Sur as a fairly young child,
moved to New York City and then back over
[SPEAKER_04]: to the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I first planted my first seed of
cannabis in 1983, which would have been
[SPEAKER_04]: some Big Sur developed African hybrid that
was pretty popular at the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: Malawi based thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was definitely what one of the first
I mean, it was the first plant I ever
[SPEAKER_04]: grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was also an imprinting kind of
moment where it was like the smell and the
[SPEAKER_04]: effect associated with those first early
plants that I experienced definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: shaped what I was looking for in cannabis
for the remainder of my life, because that
[SPEAKER_04]: was kind of the period when it changed
from in the late 70s to early 80s,
[SPEAKER_04]: where those early narrow leaf varieties
started to get hybridized with more
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani based stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that something that you still are
breeding or find today or has it been
[SPEAKER_01]: lost?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still I think what what it is is I'm
still breeding towards those goals,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think in many ways, I mean,
it's hard to say what what we thought
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis was in the past and how we're
trying to achieve those same effects or
[SPEAKER_04]: traits or whatever, because it's a memory
at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we don't have the analytics
to go back on, but there's always been a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain effect that I felt was most
interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Afghani kind of base stuff was
just never that interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've always kind of been chasing that
that type of narrow leaf variety and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to improve their agronomic
capabilities by crossing them with things
[SPEAKER_04]: that maybe are a little bit more early
flowering and higher yielding and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely the the effect side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still see it today when I encounter
people's land race based stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely the what I like to
consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: The challenge is always looking at it and
going, wow, how can we bring that to the
[SPEAKER_04]: market?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we bring these things that I think
a lot of people really desire from
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis to the market and in a way that
we can make it happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I do think that everyone
appreciates those older those varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I also really appreciate land race sort of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's become, with the exception of
the aromas involved, all the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: today is frightfully similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what most people are
used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you were exposed to cannabis 20
years ago, you never really had much of an
[SPEAKER_02]: idea that there's so much diversity
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but when you're talking about land
race strains or cultivars today,
[SPEAKER_01]: can you give me some examples of some
stuff you've come across recently and who
[SPEAKER_01]: has them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it something that that person had
like seeds that they forgot about from the
[SPEAKER_01]: 70s or that they've been breeding it
diligently for the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they've been the stewards of those
genetics for the past 30 years or a little
[SPEAKER_01]: of both.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a few seed companies that
have been championing land race based
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics and have continued to provide
those so people can still go out there and
[SPEAKER_04]: find things land race based because it's
not a land race once it leaves the region
[SPEAKER_04]: and the geography and the people that
created it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but no, there's there's some new stuff
that I've seen that have come from seed
[SPEAKER_04]: companies and also a fair amount of stuff
that just came from those custodians of
[SPEAKER_04]: their old varieties and their yeah,
they're they're unique, but they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're they're just great cannabis
varieties that make you feel good and and
[SPEAKER_04]: have a lot of positive attributes that you
know, that people seem to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's it's always been a discussion
of, you know, I think from the original
[SPEAKER_04]: hybridization of these narrow leaf and
broad leaf varieties to now, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: people really appreciate the effects
associated with what we call sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's always this marriage of,
you know, can you get a farmer to grow it
[SPEAKER_04]: versus all my friends who want to smoke
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's a compromise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we've been doing for
decades is making these compromises.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those original land race based
varieties that were imported from around
[SPEAKER_04]: the world, they were all very unique and
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each one of them, because there was no
they were all came from a very far off
[SPEAKER_04]: land where they were isolated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but specifically, what who are some of
the the breeders or people who like
[SPEAKER_01]: recently have come across who have some of
what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really known breeders,
more more old friends that have the
[SPEAKER_04]: similar ethos in terms of like,
I'm willing to grow varieties that take a
[SPEAKER_04]: long time to flower and yield very low and
are hard to sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And doing that for decades at a loss in
order to maintain what they believe is
[SPEAKER_04]: high quality cannabis and what people
should be smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needless to say, a lot of those people are
not commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just not their main.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they really want to make a bunch of
money, they grow the same thing as
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else grows, but a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you just hit on kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The California regulated market and kind
of like love and, you know, like the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that some stuff takes much longer to
flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's we're in a market where it's
like, yeah, you got to turn stuff over
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly and.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's also partially because we
haven't the market hasn't matured enough
[SPEAKER_04]: to appreciate all the the the full
spectrum of possible products that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: make from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that in to draw a
comparison to wine, which is often not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you think of how California looked
at wine production and sales 30,
[SPEAKER_04]: 40, 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to grow a lot and they wanted
to sell it for cheap and they wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: provide, you know, as much as they could
to as many people as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea of boutique wine and and wine
that had been aged and wine, late harvest
[SPEAKER_04]: wine and dessert wine and all these things
that we now realize that there's a there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a consumer that will appreciate every
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's the hundred dollar
bottles of wine, there's thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_04]: of bottles of wine, there's five dollar,
two dollar bottles of wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with cannabis, we're right in the
middle of that commodity specialty market
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's all the specialty products are
all bound to the commodity market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can't really break through that
ceiling and say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really low yielding,
late flowering variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to pay the farmer the
equivalent of what they'd make on a low
[SPEAKER_04]: yielding, a high yielding, early flowering
variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do believe that will happen once
people get to experience them and
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think another bottleneck is on the
farmer's side when you're thinking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, producing for the regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if batch size testing is 50
pounds and you're producing less than
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but you're still incurring the same
cost and then you have to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the costs associated with being
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people are probably just staying out
of the market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have great stuff that I would
love to smoke, but it's not going to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulated market anytime soon.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you as a consumer haven't
convinced the commercial producer that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to pay more for it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it definitely, regulation has driven
these eight, nine week varieties to
[SPEAKER_04]: capture the entire market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where we used to have,
you know, people used to grow outdoors and
[SPEAKER_04]: grow big giant super silver haze plants
that took forever to grow, but they
[SPEAKER_04]: figured out a way to make it profitable
and they were able to supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's a production era,
you know, that we're trying to ramp up
[SPEAKER_04]: production and figure out how to turn this
into agriculture instead of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing that you look at are
things like yield and flower time and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but once, I mean, just to backtrack
to the Netherlands, what one thing that I
[SPEAKER_04]: thought was just really interesting and
made it work there is that they had almost
[SPEAKER_04]: every coffee shop had a menu with two
sections.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had high or four sections.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hydro bio Indica sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in your, they paid more of a coffee
shop would pay a cultivator more for an
[SPEAKER_04]: organic sativa because they knew they
said, look, we need to have this product
[SPEAKER_04]: on the shelf because people want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way you as a cultivator can
justify growing it is if we pay you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was stuff that was growing
greenhouses or what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Greenhouses and indoor, but it was just
basically acknowledging that the haze for
[SPEAKER_04]: instance, was just not something you could
grow in these big chunky sea of green
[SPEAKER_04]: production models.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that it was probably the most
desirable cultivar in the entire city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are they going to pull it off the
menu when it's what everyone wants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the only way to keep it on the menu
is to pay the farmer more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still on the menu and it's still
there and it's still cost more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can buy haze easier in Amsterdam
than you can buy it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a more mature market is
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel like Amsterdam also has taken
what I would consider some wrong turns
[SPEAKER_01]: recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about kind of the
Amsterdam, which was the Mecca of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption and the scene, how it kind of
bungled, like what have you seen in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what was the last time you were
there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there in 2018 in the summer and that
was the first time I've been back in
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was surprised to see that little had
changed, that they didn't embrace,
[SPEAKER_04]: they've always, the Dutch were really good
with looking at things from a social
[SPEAKER_04]: policy angle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they didn't really look at cannabis
from a supply chain production side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they never really created a robust
system that could grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would go back to Amsterdam 13 years
later and if you buy a gram of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and they pull it out of Tupperware and
they shake it all up and look at it and
[SPEAKER_04]: then pull it out and squeeze it and cram
it into a little Ziploc bag and take a
[SPEAKER_04]: sharpie and write haze on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, wow, like we're in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got all this manufacturing and
production and all these different vape
[SPEAKER_04]: pens and pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just said, no, we're just keeping
it the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not trying to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're looking at actually
creating an actual system that might
[SPEAKER_04]: accommodate more of an agricultural model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can only imagine the coffee shops
and the patrons are nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about on the cultivation side?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Dutch are known for their
ability to grow massive amounts of fruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables and agriculture in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they on cannabis cultivation
using their domain expertise of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural production?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they've really looked at
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember that all this was
done by turning a blind eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was legal to sell cannabis in a coffee
shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not legal for that coffee shop to
buy cannabis and they cannot claim it on
[SPEAKER_02]: their taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's never been part of the business
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're talking about limiting
cultivation to only a few growers to
[SPEAKER_02]: supply the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether this will happen or not,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's presently what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That won't be good for consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There suddenly won't be anybody who's
going to be growing a haze because they
[SPEAKER_02]: really won't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to have a situation
that will be the final blow to the
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity you used to experience in coffee
shops there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first went there, there was
imported cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it mostly coming from the US?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some from the Caribbean and South
America and all the normal supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from Africa, was it kind of land
race stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what countries was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Malawi, South Africa, all the subdivisions
of Southern Africa essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was mostly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are kind of today some of
the most intriguing kind of cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: regions in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are you keeping an eye on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Columbia, different parts of Africa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, any of those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody's far enough from present day
reality that they somehow missed out on
[SPEAKER_02]: growing skunk, then yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going land race collecting now is why
bother?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you really know somebody who's
way off on the top of the Reef Mountains
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere, it's possible, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get on Instagram sites today
and you see Afghan guys in Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_02]: growing California varieties, you're like,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last place land races really came from
was Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Late 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the last ones to kind of come on
the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other ones have come along since.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing that wasn't there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been refueled a bit over time in the
80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since then, good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically on the mountain sides of a
lot of these or in the valleys or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you're seeing kind of blue dream
and purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Morocco last year and it's
incredible really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was there in late 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, early 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was still mostly the traditional
narrow leaf tall Keefe plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: which they made, you know, soon Tashish
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see those at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it basically looks like an indoor or
greenhouse grow, except the building's
[SPEAKER_02]: gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're all it looks like fields
of cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're generally not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're generally all female seed
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're quite, you know, inbred to
make that happen a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're very uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see differences in blocks of
somebody's seed versus somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the next year, people won't be buying
so much female seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still plenty of males around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all full of seed, which makes the
buds even look fatter and more amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: than they actually are because they're
chock full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but they're it's just bizarre.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a drip tubing everywhere
and always identical looking plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing's more than four or five or four
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them, you know, six feet would be
a big plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see over the top of all these
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So historically in the 70s, when you go to
those fields, there'd be to look like hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: fields today really close together and
just a lollipop, as we call it,
[SPEAKER_02]: on top of a stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it was one big bud, one cola and
no branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like Turkey today when our hemp
fields, about 30 plants to a square meter
[SPEAKER_02]: square yard, approximately 35 maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's not not very much room in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can squeeze in between them if you
want to walk through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can can you talk about, you know,
on Instagram, people always talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen shuckers versus breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so can you each kind of talk about
your approach to breeding?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what makes a breeder a breeder,
in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you were you personally would call
someone a breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are what's your like an academic
or a science?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the intent, you know,
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for instance, I talked to a friend
of mine recently who who was the guy who
[SPEAKER_04]: popped the original sour diesel seed,
you know, and I was going to write
[SPEAKER_04]: something up for him for a magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, look, I want to write
something up for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the breeder of our deals.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't make the cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just a guy who put the seed in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we allowed to say who that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can get into that another time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but he put the seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's there's there's, you know,
consensus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amongst all the people who were involved
in that plant that he is the guy who put
[SPEAKER_04]: the seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where was this?
[SPEAKER_04]: In upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but he wasn't the breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he didn't really breed that variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he did make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the steward.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a custodian.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one who made it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He deserves all the credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess what a breeder is,
is someone who has some intent to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: create something like I'm going to do this
in order to make that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to thoughtfully take
something from here and something from
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what the outcome I'm either
trying to achieve or maybe I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: achieve some unknown outcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different than just letting the
pollen fly at will and just selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little different, you know,
but I would really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but at the same time, that being said,
as far as I know, all of the modern
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties, the amazing modern cannabis
varieties that we've smoked over the past
[SPEAKER_04]: decades all came from someone who just had
a few seeds that fell out of a bud that
[SPEAKER_04]: they had in a bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been an amazing cannabis
plant that was developed by a true
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding program, by a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are, but they're not in our drug
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of plenty of plant breeders who
could have been working with wheat or
[SPEAKER_02]: cotton or anything have worked with
cannabis, but they're basically hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders, you know, but and people have
done some medicinal breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally, it's seeds that fell out of
a bag, whether the bag came from a brick
[SPEAKER_02]: from Colombia, hence a land race,
or whether it's a bag seed from someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who wasn't supposed to have seeds in it,
which is most common these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they made additional crosses with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that they just pulled it
out of the seed of the bag, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: under a big breeding program that was so.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the smallest, the smallest little
operation, some guy who has four lights or
[SPEAKER_04]: a little backyard grow, those are the guys
who've produced all the most amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics that we consume for recreational
and medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you think of any variety,
I mean, they're all just came from small
[SPEAKER_04]: grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're at this precipice now
where we have all this, all these
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that have been developed,
some of really amazing and valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we can actually improve upon them
with a little bit more of an advanced and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, larger approach to breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that's the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, it's still where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we touched on it for a little
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you talk about your intent and
what you're trying to create?
[SPEAKER_04]: My intent was to stay with one line.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always been to that there was just
like I mentioned earlier, that there was
[SPEAKER_04]: this kind of this white whale that I was
chasing something that you remember from
[SPEAKER_01]: your youth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember I remember it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I remember losing it and then
finding it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once I found it again, I decided like,
well, I'm just going to breed this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try and improve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not going to try and create a
bunch of different varieties with with a
[SPEAKER_04]: with a bunch of diversity of flavors and
and different phenos that people can kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of just, you know, what's the phenom?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the strain de jour coming from this
breeder?
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wanted to stick to the sage line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that everything that came out of it
really felt like sage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether they were slightly higher,
you're seeing varieties that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe a slightly sedative version of sage
or higher to penaline varieties that were
[SPEAKER_04]: more energetic and focusing, that it would
just be along that line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for about 20 some 20 for 25 years,
I've pretty much done that where I haven't
[SPEAKER_04]: really introduced much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every time I would introduce a new
cross, I would work through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over a number of years before I introduced
another cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give an example of something that
you introduced and what you were looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to accomplish?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the most I guess the most distinct
difference was when I came back from
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam to California in 1999.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was good friends with Josh D and
that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they introduced me to OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw some things in that plant that
were really valuable in terms of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such as what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, marketability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, yeah, that was a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's it's a powerful plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns up the octane on a lot of other
when you cross OG with things,
[SPEAKER_04]: it definitely turns up the volume a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes to 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes to 11, mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But and I always felt sage was just fine
and plenty was enough for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when people are smoking a lot and
getting into dabbing and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: and doing concentrates, people really want
a strong variety of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I crossed OG with sage and then had a
sage OG male that I crossed back to sage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that produced a variety called Zeta,
which to me had the majority of the sage
[SPEAKER_04]: based effect in attributes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it had a little bit of the bag appeal
and slightly earlier flowering period of
[SPEAKER_04]: OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely made a more marketable
variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still missed the old sage at that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was also when I didn't save enough of
the old seed and went down this line,
[SPEAKER_04]: diverged along this path and didn't
maintain what I really was into,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was which was kind of the lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost view it as like the light
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have like the one that packs the
punch, which is the one that's crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: with OG and then the original,
which is like a wine versus a tequila
[SPEAKER_01]: shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just more focused and energetic and a
little bit, you know, kind of weed you can
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still strong enough that if you
smoke enough of it, you get, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have you gotten back there or are you
still trying to get the less?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get back there a little bit through
selfing and going into that actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought back some more sage,
a sage male that I crossed against that
[SPEAKER_04]: sage OG cut and diluted it just enough to
parse out a little more of those OG
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics, but still have some of
those bag appeal and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is the ultimate goal to once you
where are you in terms of creating the
[SPEAKER_01]: sage of your dreams?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously you can always keep on
iteratively bringing it in directions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but do you have something right now that
is like this is a masterpiece for my
[SPEAKER_01]: personal taste?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, close.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely you could.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could always improve things,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at some point you have to settle,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I have a variety that I call
holy, which is kind of at one point the
[SPEAKER_04]: there was Big Sur genetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy is in the sage family, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is your whole MO like everything is
going to be some sage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll explain that because there's a
lot of confusion around that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the the seed stock that I used to
make sage was from partially from Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Big Sur, there was a variety that
was known called Big Sur Holyweed from the
[SPEAKER_04]: late 60s and early 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Big Sur Holyweed was predominantly
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was pretty at one point
everything grown in Big Sur was called Big
[SPEAKER_04]: Sur Holyweed because it was the way to,
you know, add an extra couple hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: bucks on a pound of weed, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so but the variety that I used to
cross into sage was actually a African
[SPEAKER_04]: variety, but it was grown in Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the 90s, when I was in Amsterdam
and just quickly by Africans, since it's
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously a big continent, is this like a
southern Malawi, Tanzanian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are those on the same parallel?
[SPEAKER_01]: As where you were in Big Sur, like the
southern equatorial equivalent of your?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, I think it would it would be now a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microclimate, it wasn't kind of
mimicking the northern kind of reflection
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how important that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it's a good question,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but anyway, there was African genetics
in that original sage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was born in Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at one point, seeds were sold as sage
times Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there there was this kind of
misconception that there was original Big
[SPEAKER_04]: Sur Holyweed genetics in sage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while exploring different crosses,
sage crosses, I did find something that
[SPEAKER_04]: did really remind me of some of that early
Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: A fact that high terpenaline kind of
Acapulco gold like a fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I called it Big Sur Holy or Holy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because it reminded me of the
homeland, it had that nose and that that
[SPEAKER_04]: feeling of of way back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that to me is just what I enjoy
smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone who tries it seems to think
it's just a really nice, really nice plant
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you confirm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you could make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can improve on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a late flowering variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you could get that same effect in a
nine or ten week flowering plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you'd have something really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an example of something that
you're now focused on is how do I shorten
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowering time of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as much as possible without
compromising the.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would be some strategies to get
like would you cross it with specific like
[SPEAKER_01]: you have your ion specific cultivars to
cross it with?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, probably my next move if I was trying
to improve that line would just be a
[SPEAKER_04]: larger selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to try and put out enough seeds that
you could get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully something that was earlier
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so as a breeder, what's kind of you've
created cultivars that you love,
[SPEAKER_01]: you think other people will love.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's what's your next move?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it to sell seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it to sell clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it to flower it out yourself and create
a brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to all the above and to some extent
not really in the seed selling business
[SPEAKER_04]: never really have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never bought seeds, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just recently bought my first hundred
dollars worth of seeds from some land race
[SPEAKER_04]: provider.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now the next goal is to get these
plants what I think I have value in
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial growers hands and to try and
figure out a marketing strategy to teach
[SPEAKER_04]: people how to appreciate these varieties
and to teach retail outlets how to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: them and teach consumers how to request
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a big topic that we're
the whole industry is kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we kind of use the word land race to
kind of describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's there's this interest in these
heritage lines that have either just a
[SPEAKER_04]: point of difference, which is really
important while you're trying to establish
[SPEAKER_04]: a brand, or they have a really do have a
different effect that people can notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's an important part
of this stage of our industry is consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once people get to experience it and
really not just smoke it once at a party,
[SPEAKER_04]: but actually have a retail that provides
them on ongoing basis, then they will come
[SPEAKER_04]: back and say, no, I demand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm willing to pay more and tell the
farmer to grow more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it almost needs a push and
pull strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the the pull coming from consumers
coming in and asking for what do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: that's unique and not the hype strains and
maybe land race and then the push of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, farmers willing to grow it on a
scale, you know, and then get it through
[SPEAKER_01]: the distribution system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, back to the wine thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Northern California grew a lot
of high Northern California and Central
[SPEAKER_04]: Valley grew a lot of high yielding wine
grape varieties that were high sugar,
[SPEAKER_04]: high yielding varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were well established.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Mendocino County and Sonoma,
they grew a lot of Zinfandel, for
[SPEAKER_04]: instance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those wines were really old
and produced a lot and established and
[SPEAKER_04]: hardy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they remember the white Zinfandel
thing in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to press red grapes to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would no contact with the skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'd make this this white wine from a
red grape.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very popular in the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have a white Zinfandel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but it was crap wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right at that same time, people were
learning about, you know, Burgundian style
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinot Noir, you know, growing Pinot Noir
grapes, but then producing them in the in
[SPEAKER_04]: the style similar to how they do in
Burgundy in France.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as people got a taste for
that, they're like, oh, are you kidding
[SPEAKER_04]: me?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I drinking this box one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then but what do they have to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to cut down acres and acres of
Zinfandel producing and then plant a
[SPEAKER_04]: little thing that doesn't even yield any
fruit for years in order to wait for the
[SPEAKER_04]: market to mature and wait for the consumer
to ask for that bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a bunch of steps back to take a bunch
of steps forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, agriculture requires foresight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really believe that, you know,
that you have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not the consumer's fault or the
farmer's fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that we have to have this feedback
loop, this push and give and take that
[SPEAKER_04]: creates those demands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's part of our job as
cannabis historians and aficionados is to
[SPEAKER_04]: say, hey, there's varieties out there that
we think are really interesting and you
[SPEAKER_04]: might all appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: As breeders and like moving from the from
the point of that most of the breeders are
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains that we've been smoking and
love come from small producers growing
[SPEAKER_00]: those four or six or 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you maintain the integrity of your
genetics when you scale up and what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important thing about that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like wine that each year might be
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to maintain control of the
cultivation process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you let the genetics out of your hand
and trust other cultivators to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you've created?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, well, I mean, I asked because
because like I've been asking for years
[SPEAKER_00]: how like the craft or boutique cannabis,
you know, industry like I've been asking
[SPEAKER_00]: this question for years and the answer I
get back from industry marketing people is
[SPEAKER_00]: in all industries you have to create your
mass market first and then out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes a craft industry, which means that
the craft and boutique as we know it now
[SPEAKER_00]: has to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that is a tragedy of unknown
proportions to someone like me who goes
[SPEAKER_00]: way back and never stopped consuming
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the long memory as well of those
of those old of the of the old strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: the old genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I miss a lot of that stuff,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, how are we going to
get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to get from here to there
if we have have to wipe out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that have to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not I'm not saying you guys
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I ask these questions,
because it is really important to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that we continue to have those
types of experiences and not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wind up with cannabis that is all the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and but you know,
when you talk to big marketers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, no, that's not how it works
in today's world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a little bit different
circumstance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of your question was how do you keep
the quality up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like wine grapes or hop cones for
that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are perennials.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're they're vegetatively
reproduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're identical to each other unless
something should happen to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick up a virus or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where your quality comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your consistency will come from from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're exactly right that the
industry is going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: five varieties or something or five
different types, let's say that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: few varieties of each that are
economically feasible to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other ones are not going to
disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still in people's backyards and
garages, and they'll still be around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people still know about them because
people will still share with their
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll be there and slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the craft side will go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be tough and it's going to
have to live in another guy's softer part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the regulatory market somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of these little people are going to
get big fat licenses to grow six plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep something alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only grow six plants anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so what's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the deal?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we have a little a little
better chance of preserving things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a little example with
grapes, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked in Hungary for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Soviet system basically did their very
best to rip out every traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: Hungarian variety, and they did very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew these white, sour, green sort of
grapes that they wanted for the export
[SPEAKER_02]: market to Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they cared about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as the shackles were taken
off, it bounced back immediately because
[SPEAKER_02]: they went around and they went to
everybody's backyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they did not get every vine
because they only ripped out the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they brought back their wine industry
in just a few years, really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and we're in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in dog years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are experiencing this like as we could
become a more agricultural model.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are seeing the craft being challenged,
although we never really had a craft
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis market the way craft alcohol
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully we'll push through this
period really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually working with a group now
called Breeders Best, which is that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: big focus on that company is that there's
this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's there's an opportunity in that
transition that to kind of save varieties
[SPEAKER_04]: and to to help commercial groups see the
value in varieties, whether it's their
[SPEAKER_04]: unique terpene or cannabinoid profiles or
agronomic traits that make them desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Appalachian a part of the scheme?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Appalachian is is it's a word that
it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Appalachian has a lot to do with
mandating certain cultivation practices
[SPEAKER_04]: and certain varieties and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that we won't have the
ability to utilize Appalachian and terroir
[SPEAKER_04]: the way the wine industry is until we
settle on things like varieties and figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out where the market is for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have native soil you're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's about a point of difference is
saying one Appalachian versus another one
[SPEAKER_04]: terroir versus another is about showing
that I'm I grow in you grow in Napa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grow Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just because I grow it in Sonoma,
I'm in a more coastal Appalachian,
[SPEAKER_04]: which has different influences on the
grape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, it's a more acidic and it's a
lighter, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can use that as a marketing
strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to both grow Pinot Noir to be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just all just say, hey,
I grow whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I throw it in an Appalachian and
that has some type of a marketing strategy
[SPEAKER_04]: to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You think French wine and how you're
really bound by structuring varieties with
[SPEAKER_04]: an Appalachian in order to make it a
marketable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just wiggle around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to tie down the varietal end of the
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little too wild on the ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't grow Sangiovese in Bordeaux and
call it a Bordeaux period.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call it French wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all different ways that
Appalachians get shot for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as you well know, you know,
the difference in elevation in a distance
[SPEAKER_00]: to the coast, all those factors are real
and really do make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like the potential really is
there if there's a little more discipline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there has to be a structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be able to point out those
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's just a different variety grown
every year, for instance, no one can
[SPEAKER_04]: compare how it's grown if nobody realizes
like, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been smoking this wedding cake in
Carpentria versus this wedding cake in
[SPEAKER_04]: Solvang.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're so totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to settle on what varieties are
grown and how we're marketing those
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: In order for people to learn about
Appalachian and terroir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually it may be that wedding
cake doesn't grow near the ocean very
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be grown in Solvang
because it's outside of the fog belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are agronomic considerations
that will come to bear as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people didn't go to hump originally in
the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: People did not go to Humboldt County to
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were back to the landers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found cheap dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They disused and abused largely land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, you know, brought it back and
made really lovely homesteads and financed
[SPEAKER_02]: this whole process by growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Mojave says there never really
was a boutique industry, there wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an illegal industry and everybody
was a boutique grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were smaller ones and larger ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you've got guys with ranges of
greenhouses that are acres and illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not going to compete with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be part of the system
where you can fit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the pricing and everything kept these
people going was strictly prohibition
[SPEAKER_02]: based.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real economic reality in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's having to restart as far as
that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you guys breed now, do you breed
for do you create with do you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make something that I like,
that I want, or are there market
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations in mind as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's both.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, it's I forget what the
the there's it's false to make the
[SPEAKER_04]: assumption that just because you like it,
other people like it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people make that that that
mistake.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that, you know,
you have to start with whether you like it
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you try it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if other people like it, too,
then you're on to something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it used to be that all good
cannabis was good cannabis and everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: liked everything to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's really about finding your
consumer base.
[SPEAKER_04]: What demographic likes what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can kind of pair those two
things together, then there's there's
[SPEAKER_04]: potential for just a lot of different
varieties in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it really if you miss that and you
develop something that you really like for
[SPEAKER_04]: reason X, but you don't convey that to the
consumer, then they're going to miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that for a minute,
because you guys have been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go into a million shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you see how the market is
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things are fractured.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably had retail experiences
where you've gone in and you've seeing how
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you create your audience now and
find that consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do you how do you what are the
techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you think about?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure to tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been a focus of mine recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been more working with other groups
and trying to figure out how to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, push their agendas forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think ultimately, you know,
nowadays it's all done through Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: and social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Creating the hype, creating the hype
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but I think that the real way to do it
and hopefully the better way to do it is
[SPEAKER_04]: to create the.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, what's that horrible marketing
strategy is you create the void and then
[SPEAKER_04]: you fill the void, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, create the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You create the problem of the solution.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people today, I think, are doing that
organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this coronavirus is going to kill
you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have been people like these effects
associated with what they call a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and right now cultivators are
all looking for sativa leaning hybrids and
[SPEAKER_04]: sativas are often the first thing that
sell that that are are sold out on the
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so have have they displaced
Indica's?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but but the market wants it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying the market is creating this
void.
[SPEAKER_04]: By saying, how come I every now and then
get to experience these plants that I
[SPEAKER_04]: love, but for the most part, they're not
as readily available as these hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think that that's happening
organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just it's just a matter of getting to
the point where everyone connects and they
[SPEAKER_04]: understand what they're looking for,
because cannabis can be so many different
[SPEAKER_04]: things for so many different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, CBD has shown that some
people don't even want to get high,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they want cannabis and they want it to
taste good still.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's smokable CBD, you know,
and we you have to if you don't if you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't create a strategy that aligns
specific compounds with the consumer,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you not only do you miss the
opportunity for them to enjoy that
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, but you lose them as a
consumer as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really challenging, I think,
for dispensaries to train staff and to
[SPEAKER_04]: have the type of products that their
customers want when they walk in and they
[SPEAKER_04]: say, I want to Indica leaning hybrid with
a high Mircein low pining, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not quite there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, if we talk to dispensary owners,
California included, but especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: other states, 90% of customers,
80% of customers, a vast majority,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's put it that way, they buy by the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want a 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they don't realize this thing that 20%
THC might make them way, way higher than
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's 25 or 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not always, you know, but I mean,
drunks pick wine by the alcohol content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, connoisseurs don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people just drink table wine with
their food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy it by the alcohol content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pulled these out because this is a
friend who grows up in Humboldt and for
[SPEAKER_01]: the market, he grows things like Mac and
ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't smoke this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, you know, he's like, I'm just one
example, but like lamb's bread is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that he really loves and,
you know, but it's not what the market
[SPEAKER_01]: wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, but every time I smoke my
friends out his inner circle, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he doesn't have the confidence to grow
it at scale to see if the market will
[SPEAKER_01]: accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's still growing kind of the
hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it probably yields half or two thirds
what these do and takes three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the market, I don't think it's
as much as figuring out whether the market
[SPEAKER_04]: wants it is convincing the cultivator to
grow it first is the biggest leap,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to, he's got to make that
decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I going to grow this thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause even though it yields low and
getting it on the shelf, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're in this renaissance of cannabis
aromas and like we can loud terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles where it's like leaping out of
the jar into your nose and selling itself
[SPEAKER_04]: before you even consume it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those terpene profiles may be
indicative of the great effect associated
[SPEAKER_04]: with that variety, but some of them might
just be loud, smelly things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're really trained now to,
to follow our nose and like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: this big blah, blah, blah thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those varieties like lamb's
bread, they're not, they're not dessert
[SPEAKER_04]: item terp flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're earthy and they're spicy and
they're herbal, you know, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: woodsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the original tie stick is
exactly that example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nothing to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really, no real great odor to it,
but it killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the real one going way back,
which I haven't seen for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went by today's aesthetics,
you'd never pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just maybe why pre-rolls will be
there saving grace for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just shut up and put it in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't judge it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I looking sexy?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so we just talked terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are kind of four terpenes that
dominate modern, at least in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Myrcine, pinene, terpenelene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's, it's myrcine, limonene and
karyophylline are almost all cannabis out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most, those three terps kind of
compete for dominance and all the OG based
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and the sours and the Kim's and the
wedding cakes and the gelatos and the
[SPEAKER_04]: cookies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure those are the three
dominants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so getting back to breeding,
what, what are you interested in seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: people breed?
[SPEAKER_01]: What other terpenes are you interested in
exploring or seeing other people explore?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've always been super interested in
terpening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's definitely been what I've been
chasing is high terpenine varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they seem to have the effect that
I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are these more energetic,
clear, focused type varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm really interested in is
cannabis varieties that have their own
[SPEAKER_04]: signature terpene profile instead of this
tropical punch, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you get a tropical punch,
you drink it and you're like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's guava, it's pineapple, it's banana.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you lose the ability to pull them out
and say like, well, I just want to taste a
[SPEAKER_04]: guava drink right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and having these terp profiles
that are a little bit, they can still be
[SPEAKER_04]: really terpy and dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean a high terp levels, but having it
not be so many competing peaks that are so
[SPEAKER_04]: like there's a variety that a friend has
given us recently and we had it tested and
[SPEAKER_04]: it had the least amount of detectable
terpenes out of the 20 or so that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only hit on 12 and most of the other
more hybrid-y varieties had 16,
[SPEAKER_04]: 17, 18, 19 detectable terpenes because
they're all hybrids of things that have
[SPEAKER_04]: all these different terp profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these, this other variety was just a
real high spike here and a real high spike
[SPEAKER_04]: here and nothing, nothing, nothing,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a high spike here and a high
spike there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really helps it to show what its
attributes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Individual character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had they had it for a long time or had
they created it?
[SPEAKER_04]: They had it for a long time and they
created it, but they didn't dilute it by
[SPEAKER_04]: crossing it with everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you dilute things, it's,
you know, it's hard to, it's hard to pull
[SPEAKER_04]: the Chihuahua out of a wolf.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But we went from a wolf to a Chihuahua
with, with all this selective breeding and
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got all this diversity of all these
different dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you lost the wolf, then it's going
to be really hard to get to the Chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now we've got- Oh, we have left
her lap dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we got left is lap dog butts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have so much hybridization in our,
in our industry now because we've had
[SPEAKER_04]: these elite cult, these elite clones that
really just took off that were inbred and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything shares.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why everything has a similar effect
to it, where it leans a little bit this
[SPEAKER_04]: way or leans a little bit that way as
opposed to distinctly different tastes and
[SPEAKER_04]: distinctly different effects and
morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you used to be able to look at
different plant varieties and they all
[SPEAKER_04]: looked very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them were super tall and thin and
branchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them were super squat and
tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you look at most modern hybrid-y
plants kind of look the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what's the, one of the craziest
plants you've ever looked at in person?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some really wild ones for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I used to like some of
the ones from Columbia that we call
[SPEAKER_02]: creepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really didn't, you know, just grow
from seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically just had one tall plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like topping things too much and
one of my friends didn't either unless
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to hide them because you
want to see the natural structure of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And plants that look like Christmas trees
are just pretty somehow and very graceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants would grow up eight,
10 feet and they, all the branches would
[SPEAKER_02]: hang down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Branches that were up three feet would
hang all the way to the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would, if you tried to grow this
indoors, it would be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it could just stand outside on
its own, it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happened to be super nice wheat
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also high terpene, lean type varieties
gone now, but fantastic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really interested in, uh,
one of the things that's ruined our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is, is the concept of bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look bag appeal, bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be a little nugget,
a nug that goes in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tripping with white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with all the resin glance,
but I wish they weren't squeezed on top,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in bracts that are stacked on
top of each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're miserable to make hashy shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted hashy varieties Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hashish varieties and the big
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think making hash is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think consuming hash is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a book about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't bring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't happen to bring that one today,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it wasn't there this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim took that one on too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he does he bag all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, but yeah, I was looking for it this
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't find it and they just realize why
right now, but it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I think hashish is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the cultures that were around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I moved to Amsterdam and started
hanging out with Europeans who knew what
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis was, but it was basically a raw
material for making hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the things from all these
different countries and that's the way I
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people still have, well,
this culture still went on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably would have thought it would go
on the way it was forever since it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: gone on forever, but that's all changed
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so what do you think of the modern
twist on the rosin press thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we moved from dry sift to bubble hash
to rosin pressing and that's kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: what all the kids are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the, the steps you left out there
were all the nasty solvents people are
[SPEAKER_02]: using.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sticking in the solvent, solventless
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I saw it, it's all in less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah, it's, it's, uh,
that has been the trend and I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all solventless and I think this
is the best yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also take your water hash or
your dry sift and make rosin out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all fits together very well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hashish is also really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, I really feel like there's,
there should, we should be seeing more
[SPEAKER_04]: hashish on the market and it's great that
we have these high concentration,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, extracts, but hashish in its
traditional form was really cool because
[SPEAKER_04]: you could, um, it was really easy to
transport.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could put it in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could put it in a little container.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could take it out and with your
finger, you could break off a piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could put it in a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could put it in a bowl, stick it on a
pin or a glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even have any paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the modern, um, you know, the,
the BHO and the rosins and the wax and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, they take a lot of gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand how to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think it's intimidating to some
people the way hash is just a really
[SPEAKER_04]: simple product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also there might even be something to
be said for having a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: plant matter left in the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it rounds off the, um, the whole
plant extract profile, cannabinoid profile
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I, I grow pretty much the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoke pretty much the same thing every
day for like a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a routine guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my tea in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't drink Budweiser, but if I did,
it would be the only thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dad drank Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I, I smoked the same thing and I
have, um, just quickly, do you,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you, do you kind of have one thing you
like to smoke or do you like to dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a tapas kind of guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, yeah, I like all of it, especially
when I'm in California, cause there's such
[SPEAKER_02]: a, such variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always like coming home from
travels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but I was going to say is,
um, so I, because I smoke one thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, um, every extracted version of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have sage and I have sage BHO and I
have sage rosin and I have sage water hash
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have sage dry sieve, all from the
exact same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does sage, uh, does it yield your
definition of a good or good hash
[SPEAKER_01]: producing cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it good hash producing cultivar?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it actually produces really good
sage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the hybrids produce better,
um, better at hashish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about how well that gland snaps off
at that abscission layer and makes it
[SPEAKER_04]: through that little pore and something for
some reason, some of these hazes and
[SPEAKER_04]: sages, they, I think they smear the
glands, just don't make it through as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you end up with a bunch of leaf
material that has all your burst glands
[SPEAKER_04]: all over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just don't quite, but under the
right conditions, it does make good hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I was going to say is that at
every different, um, type of extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: creates a very different effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from the, from the BHO to the dry sift,
they're on opposite ends of the spectrum
[SPEAKER_04]: and the dry sift is the closest to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I want the effect to be closer to
flower, but just kind of the volume turned
[SPEAKER_04]: up, the dry sift kind of does that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then by the time you've got to rosin
or even BHO, you've kind of drifted away
[SPEAKER_04]: from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's definitely something to be said
for these whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would the BHO kind of be like louder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like it's more like almost like young
and loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's louder in that it's terpier,
but it's also a different terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's been so much degradation and
decomposition and all these things have
[SPEAKER_04]: happened to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're missing the plant matter that,
you know, it's just, it's just very
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like having the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like a lot of the younger guys
who make rosin, they're, they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on getting every bit of plant
matter out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't want any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, cause it's also purity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also how they market their product is
that I've been able to refine this and
[SPEAKER_04]: make it pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of, it's very much similar to
alcohol distillation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with whiskey or scotch or vodka.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like a good drink every now and then as
well, but I tend to drink beer and wine
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's closer to the plant version
of the thing that's making that alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with cannabis, you know, I do think
that, you know, you can have a extra
[SPEAKER_04]: extract that has the profile that you
want, but if you had it in flower and
[SPEAKER_04]: maintaining it from flower to final
extract is really difficult, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: monoterpenes are just, the more you
process, the more you lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also getting rid of extraneous
plant matter or whatever you don't want,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're also getting rid of some good
stuff along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a point of diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing that people can do it,
I guess is part of the fascination we're
[SPEAKER_04]: in is that we've been able to refine it to
that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honey oil really had like a real
small blip when it was available back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was amazing that you could,
oh my God, you could take this not so,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, flavorful variety and just turn
it into this big, you know, aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the fascination is there and
that's similar to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's really cool that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with
it, but to me, I feel like it loses some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the nuances of what the right is that I
grow in, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you start dabbing with the other
thing about increasing your intake,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, once you go, once you go loud,
you can't go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this thing in the, in the,
the beer industry called the lupulin
[SPEAKER_04]: threshold shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you start drinking hoppier beers,
you can't go back because your brain
[SPEAKER_04]: resets every time it goes up and says,
Oh, I need more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been migrating in the hoppy direction
recently, like in the past six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd always kind of been like the chase
for like the IPA that's more hoppy than
[SPEAKER_01]: the other guy's IPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always like, Oh, I just want like a
Pilsner or a lager or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but now I'm, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm noticing myself buying more hoppy
beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the market's changed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've, they've in a year they've gone to
having the hoppiest and highest alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: content beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could possibly come up to the point
where if you just were doing a market
[SPEAKER_02]: survey, you would assume that it was
impossible to have a super hop forward
[SPEAKER_02]: beer that wasn't at least six and a half
percent alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's changed again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going in the market and there's
a whole bunch of beers that are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: some of them under 5% by a little bit
under the European norm and, and are hop
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not super hoppy, but that was kind
of being overdone a bit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're getting to beers that are
really a nice balance and you can drink a
[SPEAKER_02]: few and not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do damage to yourself and still have room
for another beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't, aren't people also adding a
terpenes now to their beer, creating new
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of like the mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these are spiked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but, uh, the real craft brewers
are not, I mean, it, once again,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it, if somebody who was a craft
brewer now is selling way too much beer to
[SPEAKER_02]: be called a craft brewer or a,
maybe that's not really the right term,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe independent brewer is a little
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the, once they're no longer
independent brewers, the larger market
[SPEAKER_02]: forces take over and things tend to make
their production easier and more
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want their beer tasting
different each time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A real craft brewer kind of doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, okay, this one's a little happier
than the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the next one doesn't have as many
ops in it, but they're not bottling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not, you know, selling hundreds of
thousands of units there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking it down to the local rotary
tap place and getting their mates to drink
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of kegs so they can go home and
make something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that, that's real craft
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like these market guys are saying,
okay, we had prohibition and then we had
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knew, everybody knew somebody
who was a moonshiner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my grandfather knew people who
were moonshiners.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to take around samples as he was
salesman for the Southern Cotton Seed Oil
[SPEAKER_02]: Company, which became Hunt Western Foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he used to go around with his little
oil samples and test tubes and corks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was whiskey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how he got his customers,
you know, and everybody knew somebody who
[SPEAKER_02]: could, who made moonshiner, grew weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, yeah, we've gone, they got put
out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can actually afford to get a small
distilling license.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a time there when a small
distiller, the economic thresholds were
[SPEAKER_02]: too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't sell enough to pay for the
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we at now?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't sell enough and enough for
profit to pay the overhead of operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's gone full circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the distillers and the brewers kept
people out of this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kept it for themselves as long as
they could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've got lots of little,
we have 3000 craft brewers in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably four now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Jewish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of talk about some of the
most, like when you were writing the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: book, kind of like some of your
interesting thoughts and insights on kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Define hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you define hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say that hash-ish is a
mechanical concentration of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glans or the resin contained within.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the glands are made intact for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not, the active ingredients are
not dissolved in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water hash is not because water is the
universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it works because her resin glands
are not soluble in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like moving around with air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're moving around with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's the definition for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the fascinating thing,
I'm an ethnobotanist by training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fascinating thing to me is the
plants and the cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hash-ish is a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has varying strategies for
achieving essentially the same ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find this also with fiber production
with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very into textiles and hemp for seed
and fiber as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the different strategies that
people around the world have come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: for working with hemp fibers and to take
them all the way to making fine textiles
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's much more about the people
than the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those cultivators who cultivate for
hash, and we know several who do,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that also about the person rather than
the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we know some of the same people,
which I assume we do, then I'd have to
[SPEAKER_02]: answer that question in the affirmative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because those people are characters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't represent cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outside of North American.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of them said to me once,
you should write an article on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator and the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sat and I realized that I knew three
or four different relationships that were
[SPEAKER_00]: that relationship, a cultivator who had a
relationship with a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of that relationship, they created
a third product and haven't done the
[SPEAKER_00]: article, but I thought it was really
interesting and a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just curious what you think about those
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it was it real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're they're actually really
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was real enough to make that batch of
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, it's it's kind of the
same with the land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land races are there because there was a
culture that raised the plant in their own
[SPEAKER_02]: local environment year after year from
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a chance for genetic
variation each year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without the cultures, you lose the
land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's not just that we've gone back
and taken Dutch skunk seeds to Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem also is that the Nepali
people who were making that hashish back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the day, they got older.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't live there anymore or they've
moved because they've degraded the land
[SPEAKER_02]: around them or it's just everything
changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's and you can get really sentimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the older I get, I guess the more
realistic I get, I hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also am a bit sentimental.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you miss these things and there are
times when you wish time would stand still
[SPEAKER_02]: and things would remain the way they have
been.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the essence of culture is change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all we ever get is a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it didn't change, it wouldn't be
culture and it really wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's that's it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the transformation from a hemp plant
to a textile or a cannabis plant land race
[SPEAKER_02]: or not to a piece of hashish or or rosin
or BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that matter, I think this is all
interesting, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And boy, have they taken it to these
limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just recently I saw these THCA to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I saw it ground up as a white
powder, of course, in a lab substance over
[SPEAKER_02]: the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks like all it looks like every
other cannabinoid pretty much except THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is just not a white powdery thing at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost if you've never messed with
it, it has got to be the most viscous,
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky liquid on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can tip this if it was filled
with THC right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just tip it over on its side,
even at warm room temperature like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And half hour later, it might be just kind
of starting to think about leaking out on
[SPEAKER_02]: the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA is a dry, freely flowing powder if
you grind it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And otherwise, it's these beautiful
crystals which these young guys now are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting to precipitate out all these
different shapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got these flat kind of
triangular big crystals and you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that look just like rock salt and
you've got other ones that look just like
[SPEAKER_02]: rock candy and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got to do then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the terpenes back in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are doing that purely just
to show that they can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no IP on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to know how to do it,
just log on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go into YouTube and any number of kids
will show you their variations for doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great in this world where we're
all struggling for IP, which is part of
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're just about to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also find it really refreshing that all
this stuff is just out there and anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: who wants to do it can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and yeah, nobody even tried to
claim the rosin thing because everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: already watched it happen on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the first guy do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went, dudes, check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife's hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the next episode of T-shirt press.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've innovated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've innovated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've innovated.
