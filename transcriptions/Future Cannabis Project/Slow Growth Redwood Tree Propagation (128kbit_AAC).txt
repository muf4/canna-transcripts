[SPEAKER_00]: Redwoods, when they fall over,
shoot a new tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a look at some of the old
growth trees, they're not 2,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 100,000 years old because a stump
fell and fell and fell and fell and fell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a genetic level, you're looking at
organisms that are 100,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't reproduce this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sift it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to Green Diamond, Green
Diamond is the world's largest redwood
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is the lead grower for Green
Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's been doing redwood propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to him and he says, Hey,
this is where we do all our micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a two year grow out to get them
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see my mother room?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he takes me out to 200 acres out in,
uh, in Neelin and he has redwood trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, each one of these trees
represents the best cultivar from a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand acres of redwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sent out the best team of
horticulturalists, uh, forestry
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, and we looked around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the trees measured, adjusted,
and said, this is the copy we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has a couple hundred acres of some
of the most incredible redwood trees that
[SPEAKER_00]: ever been seen on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed me the outlier trees that
are 170% greater on the curve in
[SPEAKER_00]: production and vigor than all the others,
but they can't monocrop it or it would put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in a pathogenic situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'm waiting to breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, and when are you going to
breed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, in another hundred years,
he said, it takes about 150 years for
[SPEAKER_00]: redwood to get sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, so I'm doing the first 50 years
of the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, and the next crew that comes in,
we'll take it for however long they take
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final crew will do the actual
reproduction on a seed level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're doing it with micro
propagation from these cultivars to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest, but to be able to create it on
a seed level is 150 year project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was something I had to see because
everybody's moving so fast that I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: does anybody have any time in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's still plant based
projects that are at multi-century levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I could be involved in cannabis
to where I'm a stepping stone into the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, I don't need to be the goddamn top
of the pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm a building block in the pyramid,
I'm ecstatic because whoever expected to
[SPEAKER_00]: be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were a kid, you ever think you're
going to be the building block in an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a young hustler who got into
cultivation as a kid, court a case,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing my thing, fought a bunch of
cases, never stopped because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: addicted to cultivation and hustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, I ended up having this
huge impact in cannabis because I start
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing all these things into the market
that no one had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was involved in all the CBD
development in the U S and then I released
[SPEAKER_00]: 120,000 clones of that stuff into the
public for free because at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis had such a stigma that I knew we
would never be able to get the mainstream
[SPEAKER_00]: to accept us if we didn't act in a way
that was abnormal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, listen, I'm going to open
source all this material and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide it to all the veterans groups,
all the elderly groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did is it allowed there to be
a radical change in how people perceive
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
