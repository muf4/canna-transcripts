[SPEAKER_01]: Hi guys, we're sitting here on the Boveda
booth on the Spanabiss in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi Gary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi Micha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Micha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from Austria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm from Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working for the Aga Kanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for connecting people,
also for the CBD business, for getting
[SPEAKER_00]: certified products, for patient focused
certified products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm also connecting with Boveda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I know, as far as I'm concerned,
in your country, cannabis is not legal as
[SPEAKER_01]: a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have only medical cannabis in the form
of spray and strontobinol drops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not like in Germany with flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in Germany, meanwhile, we can have
flowers in the pharmacy, which is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even have it reimbursed sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's expendable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, what about Austria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Austria is going a little bit
backwards in the legalization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they want now that also CBD products
are getting under the noble foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's also complicated in Austria
for the medical cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a quite different
situation in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the investors come from Canada,
from the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the biggest, as you say,
the biggest and fastest raised business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Austria is missing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, hopefully we're working also
with the governments and talk to them that
[SPEAKER_00]: we get in the other direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't you think it's quite crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because on the other hand, you have all
those legal CBD, but you have those clone
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses, you know, where people make
millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have legal clones in
Austria, don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Until now, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the new government tried to prohibit
the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had now in October a changing of the
CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's a big confusion in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you said, yeah, the clones and also
CBD flowers are legal and quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you still can make good money with the
legal cannabis in Austria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Aga Kanna, what are you doing
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Aga Kanna is a patient focused
non-government organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are helping introducing people,
patients with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduce them to doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make information events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we created a set of certification
process for CBD products on the European
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won a prize on the ICPC for our work in
December in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this work we start now for whole
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also companies want to get certified
from us to get honest certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in the legal CBD business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in the States, this one is,
I think, in the United States and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very different because in Germany,
cannabis as a medicine is legal now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the grassroots movement cannot invest
anything because it's mostly big
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies or big foreign
companies moving in because you need
[SPEAKER_01]: millions to be on the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you have a product on the market,
you need millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Austria, it's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow CBD on a smaller range and
open a shop and sell legal CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think is that good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that any good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the problem is with the
cannabis market, you cannot compare
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as a pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis should be different declared
as a pharmaceutical standard because
[SPEAKER_00]: always the compounds with the entourage
effect and all the the workflow of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, cannabinoids and all together
need a separate classification of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product and not as a pharmaceutical
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the wrong way where we are looking
for and also the investors and
[SPEAKER_00]: governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in Germany, it's also kind of
everybody is waiting that also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, smaller businesses can invest at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard because CBD is kind of
not illegal, but it's not as legal as in
[SPEAKER_01]: Austria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot really sell CBD, but we only can
sell supplemental products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a lot of CBD like coffee
shops in Austria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that in Vienna in the Main Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like coffee shops for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I cannot say because I'm living now
two years in Tenerife.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved to Tenerife.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I follow all the news in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my base is in Tenerife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the situation in Spain?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even different than in Austria and
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain is also more different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain we have the social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can enter officially in social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only half legal kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a gray area in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we know for local people,
but also Barcelona is more touristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Tenerife, as you know, for our clubs,
we use it for our own people and not for
[SPEAKER_00]: the touristic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree if I say it's a little bit
in Europe, it's a little bit like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: US, that it's like in the European
community, we have 27 states and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: about 25 different laws about cannabis or
statuses of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really, really strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the viewers in the US will
understand it if they compare it to their
[SPEAKER_01]: situation maybe 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a little few states where
cannabis was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a few states where it was
totally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have those states where it's like
half-baked or half-legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it chaotic?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how is the fair?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me it's the second time on the
spandabyss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quite big fair, quite busy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job is done for the day and I will
leave now to some social clubs to meet,
[SPEAKER_00]: also business people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do a little more work for Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for Weedmaps in Germany since a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a nice blog I can write for
because I like to write.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you read my articles for once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weedmaps gave me a great opportunity to
open up a blog writing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mariana.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to work on the fair here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the first booth, so come and check
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pass by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, let's medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, let's medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you soon, guys.
Bye-bye.
