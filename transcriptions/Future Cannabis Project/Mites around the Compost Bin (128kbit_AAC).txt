[SPEAKER_01]: so I came out to the composter to toss
this stuff in it and I found they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: here for a little bit but all these little
dudes so we're gonna scrape some off into
[SPEAKER_01]: this Petri dish and look at them under the
microscope so stay tuned
[SPEAKER_02]: the coffee cups they don't make a run for
it so when I brought them up here I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that they were all moving much
faster than I expected and crawling right
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the Petri dish behave behave
yourselves you you
