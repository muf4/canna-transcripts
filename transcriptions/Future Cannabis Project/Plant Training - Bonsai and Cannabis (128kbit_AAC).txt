[SPEAKER_00]: We love growers and we love to grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the amazing cannabis plant to bonsai
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bonsai trees are our real passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We travel around with a group of friends
and we are involved in that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've taken what I've learned from
bonsai, though they're different animals
[SPEAKER_00]: in some degrees, into the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about learning to train the
plant and about how to get what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to manipulate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you start with bonsai and talk
about like the art of training a bonsai
[SPEAKER_01]: tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bonsai tree starts off, it can be in
a tree that you pull out of a ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I have trees as old as 250,
300 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we begin to train bonsai by changing
the root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start bonsai from trees that
are out in nature, all the way to from a
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to your local nursery and buy a
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do different types of grafting
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll graft a black pine onto a red pine
rooting system, for example, to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the dynamics or the genetics of the
tree, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do air layering to take,
let's say you have a larger tree and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get the top of it, we can air
layer it to get roots growing out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then cut that off and make a whole new
tree out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually have two trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that bonsai tree like this tree
when you first brought it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing we want to do is we want to
make sure that the tree is healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and make sure that it's in good soil,
we would take a tree and move it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: bonsai soil, which is typically a
combination of akadama and lava,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some pumice, depending on the
species of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we know that the tree and the
roots are healthy and happy and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving, then we'll begin to train the
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's different levels of
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we first get a tree, depending on
the age, we want to get some movement in
[SPEAKER_00]: that trunk, we want that tree to look,
we not want to manipulate that tree to
[SPEAKER_00]: look old and gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it's it's been through,
you know, maybe an avalanche or animal
[SPEAKER_00]: have fallen on it or it's just it's just
really struggled through its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a wind swept style that's been
on the top of a mountain and the wind is
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting some initial styling or initial
movement into the trunk to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: something interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: In bonsai, we are masters of manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take a tree that's maybe or a plant
that's just a few years old and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it look like it's 50 or 100 years
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, these trees are if we
get a tree from the Colorado mountains
[SPEAKER_00]: from a specific geological formation
called a fin, where there's there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: dried up river bed on top and then
underneath it is a live river bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the wintertime, that river bed that
freezes shears off the roots and it
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally dwarfs those plants or rocky
mountain junipers or that those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: species that come from the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called Yamadori trees,
and they're really spectacular trees to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on and to to train.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have such history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Colorado blue spruce that's about
this big, that's 250 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to think that that was born during the
time of the revolution, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: respect that I give to these trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bonsai is it's kind of the art of it's
it's man's idealistic idea of what a tree
[SPEAKER_00]: would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to pay homage and respect to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the beginning, we get the tree,
we'll give it some movement into the
[SPEAKER_00]: trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it as it but how are you doing
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you like, like, like staking it and
like, like bending it with rope and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, all of those things will use a
wire is very common to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If wire isn't enough, we will use tie
rods, we will we get kind of medieval with
[SPEAKER_00]: these sometimes we will do what's called
raffia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will wrap this up with a plant torture,
like dungeon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll we'll wrap it up with a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to respect what you and
the wife do behind closed doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not ask, but probably good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the tools you're using,
you're you're starting to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so we will we do wiring techniques,
we will do grafting techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will carve out parts of branches to get
them to bend and turn and manipulate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might literally carve through the bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can there's one technique where you'll
actually cut a wedge out of a trunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: then bend it over to get to get that
movement and something that's older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a tree is large and thick,
and it's not going to move, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll basically scar over that spot,
you'll have like a gnarly looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that cambium layer will
reconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If done now, are you protecting it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you rubbing anything to protect
it from pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's basically an open wound,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll we'll put depending on the technique
that you use, we'll put we use different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of paste that that keep any kind of
pathogen or insects or anything out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a cutting paste, typically,
and there's different types of paste that
[SPEAKER_00]: you use for different species of trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy specific bonsai paste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azalea, for example, they love really
acidic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use a different type of paste than a
conifer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you weren't joking when you're like,
we get medieval with these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically it's not like like with
cannabis, I feel like people are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more gentle in their tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not like snapping stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we we bend these things around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We carve out large branches and turn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrap them with raffia and duct tape or
electrical tape to get them to move and to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them healthy when you when you do
that, because you really don't you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: push the tree, but you don't want to kill
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give it every chance it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might do these techniques over a
long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to move a large branch,
we might move in an inch one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next month, we'll move in another
inch and then maybe two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll move it again between the wire and
the rebar and the different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different clamps that we use to
bend a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll literally tie a branch down to pull
it down to make it look like it's its age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can imagine a new tree,
the branches kind of grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow like this on an old tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow I don't know if you can see
this, but yeah, they sag from the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sag from the foliage mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what shows the difference
between the old and the new trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to make a young tree look
old and weathered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a Hollywood studio that takes a
kid and tries to make them look like an
[SPEAKER_01]: old tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a there's another technique we
use called ginning or shari where we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take some bark and we'll strip out some
some bark to prove to show the inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll we'll treat that with a
sulfur to to make it look white to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: look like it's weathered or aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take a branch, maybe maybe a branch
dies during the during it or we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch that doesn't really fit our design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll strip all the leaves off of it,
strip all the bark off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this really gnarly
interesting feature that we'll we'll put
[SPEAKER_00]: on a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have in my Colorado blue spruce,
I was telling you about earlier about
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a mark on it about this big,
where a hundred years ago, a porcupine was
[SPEAKER_00]: nibbling on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would keep that wound open for
years to to just feed off the sap or lick
[SPEAKER_00]: up the sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's this really cool disc
feature that's on on that tree that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see the open the inside of the tree,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you come from the bonsai world into
things like, I mean, tomato plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants, kind of what are what are
some of the nuance differences and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: similar from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the similarities in the
training aspects are going to be every
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has hormones called auctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these auctions are basically what tell
a plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are and what we do with with
bonsai trees and with cannabis is I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to lay those those growing tips down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So redistributes the oxygen hormone
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have more growth sites here,
here, here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than just straight up, we lay it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then stuff's going to grow this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in bonsai, we create these pads,
these beautiful pads that show layered
[SPEAKER_00]: pads that that give us the artistic look
where in cannabis we have all those extra
[SPEAKER_00]: bud sites that create the beautiful flower
that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about tomato versus cannabis when
you're when you're training tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: versus cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they're they're quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the fruit is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit on a tomato kind of hangs down
where the fruit on on cannabis will grow
[SPEAKER_00]: more straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we would train it in a very similar
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to I like to lay the plants
down and do what's called low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's what they call high stress
training or where they actually will smish
[SPEAKER_00]: the cambium layer and bend the plant over
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates this knuckle as it
reproduces the cambium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you show me on this tomato plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if you just got these like what
are you looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you as as a tomato plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a tomato plant, I want to take and I
want to train this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring these up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what changes that oxygen
profile I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I bring these these leaves up and
this allows it to get to the camp,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the hormone oxygen isn't here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I lay it down, now it begins to
transfer that hormone to different areas
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this plant grows, I will train this
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will bring this under here and see these
buds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now more light gets into the bottom of
this this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get better light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was if this were to be grown
taller, these tomatoes would come up
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one of these leaves are going to
be basically a solar panel for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want we want to give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to let these all of these
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come up through here and then encourage
these flowers to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as this plant grows, this this these
flowers will come out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These flowers will come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll bend this down into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you want to do with this right
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would want to get this underneath here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do that by I just put this in
here to hold this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have actually grown a little bit
since we've been at the show in like two
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: In two days.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under this healthy, fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Detroit Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll bend this out here and this will
encourage us as this grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will come up in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to put this back in here
with this wire to hold it in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a lot of wire in bonsai,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow this up and as this this this
terminal flower here, I'll train to come
[SPEAKER_00]: up into this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that this doing this
increases the airflow in your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing your airflow increases your
nutrient uptake, which gives you better
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also reduces things like powdery mildew
and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Past and you can get to the plant easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things in both bonsai and
cannabis and in life in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning or trying to learn to
observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I do in the morning
with my bonsai trees and even my cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab my cup of coffee and I go out and I
just look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at its health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look to see if there might be any
insects or or any kind of diseases so that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can react to that quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a tree that's worth thousands
of dollars for a cannabis plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to take pretty good care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learning to observe and understand and
know your plants that you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: makes all the difference in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fun getting out in the garden,
having a cup of coffee and just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beauty of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's it's it's kind of
therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really it's really a passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some common mistakes you see
when people when you're watching people
[SPEAKER_01]: like start trying to use like a scragging
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody remembers the movie Karate
Kid, that's kind of where bonsai was
[SPEAKER_00]: really initiated or people learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, let the let the birds fly
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the common mistakes is
we try to put too much into a into an
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by by removing areas that don't matter
or are not either part of the design in
[SPEAKER_00]: bonsai or by keeping your plant so that
light can get into it, keep it cleaned
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows those that airflow that allows
you want to give things room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to give things room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with this, you're trying to use
you're trying to send things out so every
[SPEAKER_01]: area is taken advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if this was a cherry
tomato plant, they get really dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might I might actually clean some of
the foliage out at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might actually clean out some of the
extra buds or to clip it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and to control the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got something like maybe
hanging off here, that's gonna gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the light, I might actually clip
that out, or I would retrain it and move
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to an area that doesn't have as much
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Thank you.
