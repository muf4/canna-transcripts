[SPEAKER_01]: Bo, you have just been doing some research
and you're about to write an op-ed on
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you for or against it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been collaborating with Adam
Smith, who's been a strong proponent of
[SPEAKER_00]: interstate commerce in the cannabis space
for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just recently wrote a report out of
the Concord Current, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: that talked about interstate commerce in
the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I are co-writing another article
talking about the economics of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that should be out in the next
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the numbers say is that as people
don't have access to traditional financing
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to establish cannabis businesses,
you have to cash out your 401k or you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to get funding from friends and family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they stand up individual state
by state industries, then it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily bode well for those investors,
assuming full federal legalization occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen is that the folks in the
West Coast that have the competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage on the cultivation side,
they will overwhelm the market because
[SPEAKER_00]: they supply close to or over 80% of the
supply nationally anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just overrun those markets and
it'll create wealth destruction as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I do on the analysis is I
provide the numbers and then I let Adam
[SPEAKER_00]: opine about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a purely economic perspective,
it makes a lot of sense to allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: interstate commerce of cannabis so that
you don't have this potentiality of wealth
[SPEAKER_00]: destruction across the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, I feel like those were conflicting
statements, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying in a market, let's say like
Michigan or Ohio or Indiana, if California
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis could come in, it would dominate
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would destroy the wealth of the
people in those markets who have invested
[SPEAKER_01]: in indoor operations, greenhouse
operations, even outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there would be wealth destruction for
those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after a federal legalization,
if that happens and the market has settled
[SPEAKER_03]: down, is the scenario that you see that
there is robust cultivation in every
[SPEAKER_03]: state, a nationwide, or will certain
states be better agriculturally suited to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, like avocados aren't grown
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming full federal legalization occurs,
there will be a room for small niche
[SPEAKER_00]: markets in each and every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be the indoor growers,
the craft growers and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a commercial perspective,
the supply will come from the states that
[SPEAKER_00]: have the greatest viability in terms of
the climate and the soil composition and
[SPEAKER_00]: the rainfall and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for California and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for Washington, even Hawaii to be big
players in the space on a national basis
[SPEAKER_00]: and international basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're already starting to position
themselves accordingly from a branding
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, from a regional perspective
like Humboldt's or Southern Oregon grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those brands are coming out now in
order to cement that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, a lot of the craft farmers up in,
let's say California, Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_01]: globally it has brand recognition.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would love to smoke Humboldt weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously they can't get it even in Ohio
or wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LA market doesn't really appreciate
Emerald Triangle weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want their indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those small farmers, I feel like if
they could sell nationally, it would
[SPEAKER_01]: alleviate a lot of the issues they're
facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the California market and then
couple that with things like, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be able to do farmers markets in
California where Emerald Triangle farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: could bring their amazing harvest in
December down to SoCal and smoke everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: out and sell it and people would love and
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could sell a good portion of
their small harvest and be set for the
[SPEAKER_01]: next season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about the data you had
mentioned earlier about how much cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had talked about just Humboldt
or the Emerald Triangle in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I recently put together a
calculation of the entire output of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the United States,
both illicitly and legally, and bifurcated
[SPEAKER_00]: that between indoor, outdoor, and
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly 14 million pounds of cannabis are
cultivated and produced in California
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's by far the largest amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of that 14 million pounds,
12 million of that is actually exported to
[SPEAKER_00]: other markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically 2 million is going into the
regulated California market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Track and trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 2 million pounds will satisfy the
legal demand in California at the present
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of it necessarily is making it
into the market right now because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations that have been created by the
California regulators and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But roughly 2 million pounds, still pretty
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's larger than most of other markets
around the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, that 12 million pound
figure that's being exported to every
[SPEAKER_00]: state in the country and elsewhere,
that's a significant amount and those
[SPEAKER_00]: growers will benefit from the either full
federal legalization or for the allowance
[SPEAKER_00]: for exports out of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this interstate play to allow
interstate sales, what would it look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be... And first of all,
do you need federal approval?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously you do to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're crossing state lines or how
would that work politically?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to follow up on that question,
you can't have California and Nevada
[SPEAKER_01]: agreeing that they'll do interstate
commerce between them and the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government would be okay with that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's still kind of in a gray area
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially because of the legacy of the
coal memorandum, there's an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: that says that you can't have funding if
you're doing things legally in one state
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a gray area at the federal
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it takes at the state level is
one to say, hey, I want to export to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the governor and the other states
saying, assuming it's legal there as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'll be willing to receive it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually on that, what if you have to
go over other states?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's easy when it's state next
adjacent, but what if California strikes
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with New York state and you have
to transport that by air?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wanted to follow up on that too
because that would make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you had Oregon and California,
those are two cannabis mature markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in your world, in the economic world,
do we want to develop those relationships
[SPEAKER_03]: between a California and a New York or a
California and a Florida less developed
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you definitely want to establish
those relationships now and to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: those markets and those relationships in
order to say you're a supplier in
[SPEAKER_00]: California or Oregon or elsewhere,
to establish your distribution channels in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Governor Cuomo has already kind of
laid the foundation for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to his adjacent markets in
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere and saying, hey, we need to
harmonize our rules and regulations in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to allow for something of this
nature or at least not to have one state
[SPEAKER_00]: having more favorable policies than
another state.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do they also want to up their regional
leverage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like creating like a NAFTA of the
Northeast or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not sure about the intention,
but what is interesting, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: is I've talked to a lot of state
regulators, executive directors and that
[SPEAKER_00]: level, directors of these regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really want to have these
harmonization of rules so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging requirements in one state is
identical to the packaging requirements in
[SPEAKER_00]: another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're trying to harmonize this via
these state by state meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we were where we were was kind of
the harmonization of like the different
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned like packaging,
like examples of things that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of coordinate on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labeling, dosage, packaging, license
requirements and like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the intention of these regulators
is to lay the foundation for full federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization at the state level so that
when it does go federally legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: the feds don't come in and try to mandate
rules and regulations in a market that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these regulators at the state
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, there's one right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, can we ask you one quick
question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come sit, come sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to eat lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quickly, are you trying to harmonize
Massachusetts state regulations with your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighboring states as we go like packaging
requirements and things like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we go forward, all of the states are
talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the states near us are just
coming online like New York and
[SPEAKER_02]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhode Island has an existing market and
New Hampshire and Vermont are more
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer focused rather than a commercial
focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, we've worked well with Maine and
we look forward to working with the other
[SPEAKER_02]: New England states as they go forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a follow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does she mean by commercial focused
as opposed to I think she meant medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial like in the production and
manufacturing and cultivation versus
[SPEAKER_00]: because some of these markets are only
just retail, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do they source from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're legal retail, but they're like
going like this like to where it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are vertically integrated,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be vertically integrated
versus like and that's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: topic in itself because in Florida,
they ruled that vertical integration is
[SPEAKER_00]: unconstitutional in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they blew up that whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what these as was validated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like that Florida is not letting
people vertically integrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do because it gives more opportunities,
more jobs, more wages, more economic
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities for city and state and local
municipalities to benefit from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I've been a big fan of
spreading the wealth as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which market gives some grades to
states that are making it possible for mom
[SPEAKER_01]: and pops to thrive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who gets an A and who get like who
gets a C and who gets an F that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that states, you know,
given the fact that I have these great
[SPEAKER_00]: relations with all of these regulators,
I think it would be a little bit difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: to grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, but who can improve?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like Oklahoma is kind of like the
Wild West, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're just like, let's let
everybody play.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that going?
[SPEAKER_00]: What Oklahoma has done is that they've
allowed for greater access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really just need a note from
your doctor in order to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: access to cannabis and really not a whole
lot or a limited number of of qualifying
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've Oklahoma's opened it wide,
wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's medical, but they're very lenient
on what like my knee hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess where I was coming from was
the the entrepreneurial side where
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma, like if Tom and I wanted to
start a tincture company, we could start
[SPEAKER_01]: it in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this is like I said earlier,
I'm a firm believer in spreading the
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth out to as many people as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because each state is a closed market,
there's going to be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a limit to the amount
of economic opportunity that each state
[SPEAKER_00]: has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a perfect example of this is Oregon,
where they issued licenses out to a large
[SPEAKER_00]: number of cultivators, a large number of
retailers and like hoping to draw in folks
[SPEAKER_00]: from the illicit market and do things
legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they didn't do effectively enough
is balance the supply and demand elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result of all of those licenses,
they sure they spread out the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened is it created this
tremendous tsunami of supply and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: took the prices down substantially and
ended up hurting those small businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were actually trying to support.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in California, California does allow
vertical integration licenses,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not everyone gets them in the retail
sector.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have the micro licenses and
then others don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see that as an uneven playing
field?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have you taken a look at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, Oregon allows for vertical
integration as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so if you can get your
license, then great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just the fact is that you don't
have to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some states like Florida, you had to up
until just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the value of those licenses in
Florida were worth tens of millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did a valuation of one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 50 million dollars for
that license because it was vertically
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated and you had to source all of
your supply from yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the value of a license in Oregon
was maybe one fiftieth of that amount just
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were more licenses to be
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you actually talk about how you
approach putting a valuation on licenses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people are like,
we're going to be an MSO and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to roll up a whole bunch of operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, OK, what are you going
to pay for those operators?
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other side, people are like,
we're going to raise money and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to start selling stuff and we're going to
have a hundred thousand dollars in sale
[SPEAKER_01]: and exit for a 10 million dollar
valuation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The consistency of the value of those
licenses, which we're seeing, can
[SPEAKER_03]: fluctuate and change according to
regulations and other factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are you putting a valuation on a
company?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of ways that you can go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I try to do is I try to use
multiple techniques and then look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in the values that come as a
result of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally what you do is you look at
the past history and the future forecast
[SPEAKER_00]: of a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at how much revenue they've
produced, how much their cost structure
[SPEAKER_00]: is, what their margins are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you assign a multiplier to that
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some in nascent markets, there's not a
whole lot of comparables or comparables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't have, there's not a great
deal of consistency from one valuation to
[SPEAKER_00]: another, to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally in the nascent markets,
you look at the top line revenue and
[SPEAKER_00]: assign a multiplier to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And would that multiplier be higher than
in a saturated market like Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the multiple that a company is,
like a multiple of earnings that a company
[SPEAKER_01]: is trading at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of the valuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would be sold at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you do have to factor in the
environment and the regulatory and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a risk factor or a beta that
you assign to it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do your valuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, for example, if you go this
approach, top line revenue, assign a
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're different between cultivators
and processors and retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Processors generally have higher multiples
than do retailers and like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some of the reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, retailers, for example, they have a
different cost structure, different
[SPEAKER_00]: taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's much greater costs associated with
taxation because there's not as many write
[SPEAKER_00]: offs at 280.
[SPEAKER_01]: But could you factor in that potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if 280 changed down the road,
the multiplier would increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The valuations would definitely increase
because another strategy is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: your profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by looking at the profitability,
then you assign a multiplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with the change in 280 tax law,
that would immediately impact your bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line because you wouldn't be paying as
much taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, you'd be potential for
greater profitability, which would make
[SPEAKER_00]: you more valuable in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the feds don't seem interested in
giving up that money at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years ago, when President Trump came
into office, the group that I work for,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Frontier Data, presented my 280
analysis to a health policy adviser for
[SPEAKER_00]: President Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: His reaction was, why would I give up six
billion dollars in tax revenue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about it, it's a valid
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you give up, quote unquote,
you pay for more than enough via
[SPEAKER_00]: employment, via social securities and
payroll taxes, business taxes and like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and you're supposedly a business
friendly Republican administration,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're saying that argument is
gaining traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The argument that they'll make up more in
the long term.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you said they're coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the conversations at the
federal level on tax reform and banking
[SPEAKER_00]: those conversations are heating up right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that I mentioned in my speech
earlier that there is a briefing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're helping these folks prep for on the
Senate Banking Committee and Senate
[SPEAKER_00]: Finance Committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the data points that we
gave them was the impact of 280E,
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact of doing cash only business and
the risks associated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just can you name some policy
sensible politicians in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some of the people who are like,
this just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing is that as the
mainstream population gets more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: accepting of cannabis use in their day to
day lives, as states roll out reform and
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, either at the medical side
or at the adult use side, those states
[SPEAKER_00]: that are represented by those legal states
that are represented tend to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable views and influence in
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because now 98 percent of the citizens
of the United States have some form of
[SPEAKER_00]: access to cannabis, either through CBD,
medical or adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given the Pew Research and the other
surveys that show there's 64, 65 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: in favor of legalization, these types of
statistics are helping politicians get the
[SPEAKER_00]: traction that they that they desire on
reform policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but are there specific people in
either the Senate or the House that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like Dana Rohrbacher was a friend to
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was out there championing like
who's the next wave of people that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should all.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a big fan of Russian cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Russians and Russians and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves Vladimir Putin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's really tough to call out
names per se that are more favorable than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I will say is that, you know,
now that you've got California online for
[SPEAKER_00]: the most part and all of those votes in
the House of Representatives, now that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you've got New York and the East
Coast starting to consider cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: reform, then those folks that
traditionally hadn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nancy Pelosi is now supportive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chuck Schumer, I'm thinking of people
in those states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's she's out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nancy Pelosi.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's in Washington, but she represents
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like I said, there's a greater
propensity nowadays to support cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even coming up in the presidential
campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because it gets you votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times have you heard either that
somebody consumed previously or that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in favor or in the first day of
their presidency, they're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do a presidential mandate,
you know, de scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is coming up in practically
every debate that we're seeing now,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas even four years ago or eight years
ago, it wouldn't even come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the politicians that I've
talked to are saying that this is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a bipartisan issue, but it can be used to
differentiate one candidate over another
[SPEAKER_00]: in these elections, especially in the
primaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly, getting back to the
initial conversation about interstate
[SPEAKER_01]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I think of like the craft farmers
who, you know, their stuff is appreciated
[SPEAKER_01]: by people in other markets, it's obviously
also the large scale growers and Selena
[SPEAKER_01]: and Santa Barbara who also see a benefit
of being able to export globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, the benefits are those that
have that core competency in a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: task, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either cultivation or processing for that
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have that core competency,
then of course they have a leg up relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to other people that are just trying to
start out, you know, in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, by allowing interstate commerce
of cannabis, it would be very beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: to those that are producing large
quantities, especially on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will really help with standardization
as well in a big way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, if companies want to go into
other states, you have to create their own
[SPEAKER_03]: footprint or have partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are all extremely difficult
tasks that all these companies have been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing for the last three to four years in
order to acquire and to expand their
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's with the, with regards
to MSOs, multi-state operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: by establishing that brand now and being
allowed to export it, of course it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, it's going to benefit those
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my question and maybe we can kind
of wrap it up because it rolls in 280E and
[SPEAKER_03]: the states and interstate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to tie this whole
conversation together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming back to opening up the market,
when you look at the nascent markets or
[SPEAKER_03]: states that are about to come online,
you're like, sometimes when I look at
[SPEAKER_03]: them, it seems like you have to be a
conglomerate or a multimillionaire in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to enter those markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so is that an impediment to the
establishment, a creation of the type of
[SPEAKER_03]: industry that we want to see that,
that has players at all different levels
[SPEAKER_03]: and where the cost to entry is,
is not absolutely prohibitive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, because they have a vested
interest in keeping it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see that the value or the
appreciation for a more diverse economy in
[SPEAKER_03]: the nascent states?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, each one of these states though,
the success or failure and how widespread
[SPEAKER_00]: the economic benefit is, is really
determined by the regulatory structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some states, you know, you have to lay
down two million dollars in order to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a certain amount of that
two million dollars liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a huge... Can you give an
example of one of those states?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was, I think that might have
been Michigan or Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got, you've got those huge
barriers to entry at a, at the very time
[SPEAKER_00]: where a lot of these communities,
minorities, people of color have been
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted negatively by the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just creating these barriers to
entry and not allowing for access to those
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that could really benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so that's the unfortunate
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but as interstate commerce occurs,
the intent of that type of policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation would be to actually reduce
the harm that would otherwise occur to
[SPEAKER_00]: these small businesses, these minority
businesses and the like that would occur
[SPEAKER_00]: if they just get wiped out due to full
federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more of a preventative measure,
which will actually benefit the
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll allow for, for people with core
competencies and growing to export to
[SPEAKER_00]: states where there's a core competency and
distribution and retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the model and the model
makes really, really good sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have a, like a, an idea about
how this might come to pass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a timeline or a hopeful, like a road
to interstate?
[SPEAKER_01]: A crystal or a crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what's the plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: For federal interstate or interstate
commerce, like when you predict... Is it
[SPEAKER_03]: just lobbying, lobbying and lobbying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's two absolutes in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is I don't know how many 19 year olds
I've met with 20 years growing experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other absolute is everything
is going to take five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard for five years that
it's going to be fully federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think my default answer to your
question would be in about five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but in, in reality, I mean,
it's, it's, it could be accelerated if a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of these large states like
Pennsylvania, like New York, like New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey, if they deploy legal programs and
they drive this policy, because there'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be greater representation in the Senate,
greater representation in the House of
[SPEAKER_00]: Representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could create a cascade effect,
which accelerates the pace of reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it going to happen in two years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not three, maybe five for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking on camera here as Bo Whitney
of Whitney economics and not as a
[SPEAKER_00]: representative representative of new
frontier data, but new frontier data
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't do any advocating at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't take a legal position on,
you know, the legality of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, we don't propose legislation
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we analyze the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now under Whitney economics, I have
greater flexibility to take on projects
[SPEAKER_00]: like the interstate commerce bills and,
and writing on that because it could take
[SPEAKER_00]: on a more advocacy like tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why, you know, I've been,
you know, doing a lot of work under
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitney economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a consulting business out of,
out of Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a company where I've done the
business valuations, the expert witness
[SPEAKER_00]: testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently doing an analysis of retail,
retail chain in Washington, and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: in and optimizing their operations to
drive greater revenue and decrease their
[SPEAKER_00]: cost structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do all of that under Whitney
economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk, can you talk about some
things, how you've whipped them into
[SPEAKER_01]: business shape, like some specific
concrete recommendations you've made to
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made some recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit proprietary,
but what I have the capability to do is I
[SPEAKER_00]: can dial up an address, say this location
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you how many people stood
in this location and for how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they've come back over the course
of three months, I can tell you what your
[SPEAKER_00]: foot traffic is, what your pattern and how
long people have stayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I can tell if they went to
another dispensary two miles down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: and how long they stayed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, so I should turn off my geo
location tracking on my cell phone is what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's other ways to get to that
data, but that's one of them still track
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then in addition to that,
so you can see whether, uh, geographically
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in a good flow location,
like foot traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have, if they have recursion,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people come back, um, re recurring
customers, or if they're just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I can look at these other
locations and see if they're one and done
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, um, or if, um, retailer number
one is losing business to retailer number
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can do all that analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then I can also talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also looking at point of sale
information too, or that's my question
[SPEAKER_01]: about the, the, where their data derives
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in some markets it's different
because, um, point of sale data,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like, uh, in Oregon has to be
redacted, um, by law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't like anonymized
anonymized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, but, uh, but in other States you
have a lot more access to data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have access to metric data?
[SPEAKER_00]: I only if it's provided to me by the
retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of them, the upper level
metrics stuff, um, I would, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: get my hands on, um, because I could tell
you, um, through pretty simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, quantitative analysis, who are the
good actors and who are the bad actors?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is actually a great
question to ask you is data in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry and the silo effect of
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is, what is your impression of
that subject?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's before we get to that,
can you tell us how you could tell who the
[SPEAKER_01]: bad actors are and the good actors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I've, I've, um,
basically run a vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: company before I was the CEO of a company
and took them public and did all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know the nitty gritty details of
cultivation of processing retail
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I leverage in a lot of
my consulting work is cause I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the operations are practically
better than they know it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so on some of the bad actors,
right, you can look at their production
[SPEAKER_00]: output.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can do a time series, uh,
look at what they're doing two years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: three years ago versus what they're doing
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can see their yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see, I mean, there's a lot of
ways in which you can ascertain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, who is consistent and a good
actor versus who is somebody that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, potentially taking stuff out the
back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these hybrid models and that's
the unfortunate thing about what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in California right now is that the way
that the regulatory structure is set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the barriers to entry, all of this
stuff, it's really forcing people into
[SPEAKER_00]: that hybrid model of a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is selling out the back door
just to be able to put food on the table
[SPEAKER_00]: and live to for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Hey, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have kept going, but let me know
when you, uh, when you, um, publish this
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll put it on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will stop you on the street and be
like, I recognize you from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I get that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Thank you.
Okay.
