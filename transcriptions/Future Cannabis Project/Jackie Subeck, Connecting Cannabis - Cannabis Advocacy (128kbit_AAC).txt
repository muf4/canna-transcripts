[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a disconnect in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seem to have a weird line that's going
down the middle of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seem to have people that are fighting
the fight, working on the regs,
[SPEAKER_00]: working on the policy, working on the
ordinances, spending time with state,
[SPEAKER_00]: county, city officials, trying to make
sure that we all have fair, equitable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and inclusive cannabis policy going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's remember, this is the first
and only time that California will do this
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really up to us to make sure that we
get it right, as right as we possibly can
[SPEAKER_00]: given the limitations and circumstances
that may happen with everything going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people in the room, let's just
quick do show hands, how many people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room keep up as much as they possibly
can on all of the regs and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about a third of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the rest of you, are you nervous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you scared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too overwhelming?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overwhelming, because I can
understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people feel it's overwhelming?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the same amount of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the same people that are fighting
feel it's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to try to do tonight is
shine a light on the advocates and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofits, because here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people who are making all
this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people who are working hard
with all of the government to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is a solid foundation for
businesses to sit on top of and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of the coin is those people
who are in it for the money only,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're in it for their own
self-interests, and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really hasn't been talked about that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just want to commend everybody in
this room for showing up tonight,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm going to tell you,
I'm going to be totally, completely honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, this was a hard topic to get
people in the room for, and it breaks my
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, because there's all kinds of people
in this room that fight every single day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yet, we couldn't get people here for
this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were joking about it, that if we said,
hey, here's a way to make money in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, we'd pack the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we are saying, no, here's a way
to support the industry so we can all make
[SPEAKER_00]: money, hopefully one day as well,
and we're pulling teeth to get people
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the ones that we're happy
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to drill down into that topic
tonight, because we have so many amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: people and organizations that are out
there every single day making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's good policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a whole bunch of them are going to
talk to us tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through a whole bunch of
speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a really wide picture
of what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, you're going to learn a
lot, and if you do know, you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just really where we want to
go, and I wanted to stress that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you're talking to your friends
and you're talking to other businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis businesses, encourage them,
after tonight, after you listen to what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, encourage them to get out there
and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage them to get out there and
volunteer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage them to get out there and go
speak to a city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage them to get out there and put
money in if they have money in to support
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these foundations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, MPP is here in the house tonight,
Marijuana Policy Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug Policy Alliance is here tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that these organizations who are
really doing some of the heavy lifting,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're struggling for financing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're struggling for funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people who helped carry the
baton over the line and get us to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, and yet we can't seem to get
them funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who work in this
industry every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who get no
dollars, zero dollars, but they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going and doing it because they believe
that it's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to talk about
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start with a couple of quotes
from some people that are not here tonight
[SPEAKER_00]: and also one that I'm going to read to you
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this amazing woman,
her name's Susan Burton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may or may not know her,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got Becoming Miss Burton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people in the room know who
this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Susan has this amazing book.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does reentry for women that have been
incarcerated and are trying to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: into their real lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a quote in this book that I want
to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's actually quoting somebody else
telling her this story a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's the quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, there was this book I read as a
child.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called The Little Red Hen,
where a hen finds a grain of wheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: goes around asking all the other farm
animals to help make it into bread,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no one will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, when the hen manages all on her
own to make the bread, everyone who
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't help shows up to eat the bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
