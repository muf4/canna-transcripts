[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're here with Jacques and Amy
from Newcomb Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jacques, Amy, hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a trek for you guys,
but I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about your
background and maybe give the listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: some context.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're originally vegetable fruit farmers,
traditional farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the details exactly,
so maybe let me know how you guys got
[SPEAKER_01]: started in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 28 years ago, we started growing
peaches and tomatoes and lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been our sole source of income
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, here I am, a certified
organic, long haired guy in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so every time I tell people like,
yeah, I'm a peach farmer in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_02]: County, certified organic, you know,
and people would just kind of nod and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after being like stereotyped for most
of my farming career, as I always like,
[SPEAKER_02]: always like, everybody was like,
that's why he's successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a dope grower, you know, grows weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we finally got to this point where
like with, you know, like the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization happened and we didn't jump
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, no, no, no, we're we're more
fruit farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then but that stereotype or that like
everybody had me like pigeonholed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then when recreational came around,
we kind of looked at each other and there
[SPEAKER_02]: had been the property we owned.
[SPEAKER_02]: There had been like an illegal,
you know, patch in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just kind of looked at each other
and we were like, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a diversification for the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we grow everything else really
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see what we could do with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've both had a relationship with
cannabis for, you know, since I was 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Been growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been growing it for the backyard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Backyard growing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just just for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just like we've been like,
you know, tried to just stay totally white
[SPEAKER_02]: market and enjoy the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because first couple of years,
we just grew this amazing diversity,
[SPEAKER_02]: like through diversity of cannabis
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just really seeing like what the plant
was capable of.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to test it out in your soil and
the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The certified organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are in truly native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful bottom land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have really nice that little terrace.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably like the alluvial floodplain
where it's like really high grade soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we on that same, you know,
we with all of our other crops there,
[SPEAKER_02]: we rotate our crops and we'll grow melons,
corn, carrots, like no water at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just like dry farm,
dry farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think does your cannabis
require any?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we water our cannabis,
but like, it's really about like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your definition of dry farming?
[SPEAKER_02]: We water it so little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use a drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's buried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but yeah, it's we I think this year
we're actually put a meter on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the we'll go a month at a time
without watering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's a beautiful crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfectly suited for our location.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that cutting little terrace.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's high recharge rates from the
groundwater coming through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just helps elevate the water tables
to where it seems like it keeps,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious with the diversification
of your other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just for the record, how many
different species of vegetables do you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, that's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we, you know, with the like with the,
you know, one thing that we committed to,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we really enjoy, like, growing the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also said when we started to do
this, we're like, we can't not we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: not grow food or we can't slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we still have that commitment to
feed our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the farm is like based on
is feeding our community, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy food, keep your community healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we still like produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually produce more than we ever
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have like peaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 18 different varieties.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruit trees in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have like 16 hundred trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and then the tomatoes,
20 different varieties, melons,
[SPEAKER_02]: eight different varieties, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just corn and squash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifteen varieties of pluot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do other root vegetables like
potatoes or onions or carrots ever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year what we do is we watch and see
how the rain falls and see where that how
[SPEAKER_02]: tall the cover crop gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: When is our last, you know, rain event?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that really tells us what we can grow.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some years when it's a really dry spring,
it's like, OK, no carrots, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wet spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really truly reading the cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have big totes of seed and big mason
jars of pounds of seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and some years we don't use,
you know, carrots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't grow them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next year it's a big year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the appropriate time to talk
about carrot cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as your cannabis goes,
I do find it interesting that you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: basically completely native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not many farms out there that are
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's mixed with potting soil
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be in native soil, have you found
any unique challenges with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like your plants, like health
wise, have responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only beneficial.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like I have to go to neighboring farms
to see what diseases and pest infestations
[SPEAKER_02]: look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't our our plants like and
we've learned this with with other things
[SPEAKER_02]: like the peach trees or the or the
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, when you start with good
genetics and you and especially like
[SPEAKER_02]: growing from seed, like you get that that
plant really wants to have authentic root
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you grow something that vital and
that healthy, that's like 99 percent of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, keeping pests and disease away,
you know, not getting greedy, not not
[SPEAKER_02]: pumping a plant with a lot of fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've basically noticed, like essentially
when you get greedy and you try to pump
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant with extra water, the root
systems don't develop as much because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it dries out, the plant's
going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you conversely pump it with
fertilizer, the plant grows too rapidly
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's essentially immune system can't
keep up with itself and then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: attacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also like with the root system,
it'll if you put too much fertility in the
[SPEAKER_02]: root system grows a little because,
oh, there's plenty here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't there's plenty of water right
here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the root system doesn't really go for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like with that native soil,
you really want to you want to get it like
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to get those roots searching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to have nice, loose,
porous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we do like we actually mulch all
our beds in a permanent bed system and we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually harvest the hay.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are actually closing the loop
to that degree with mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're harvesting your hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it on the same plot or that on your
other farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an adjacent same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you're harvesting the hay and the
hay is used for mulch for the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hay is actually the cover crop
that we like get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like oats, rye, veg, bell beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some things like the veg and
the bell beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll like melt into fertility really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the oats and the rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: They provide layering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they'll be a little more residual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a really interesting
biodiverse system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a cover crop as mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most of the times, every time you
hear of cover crop, it's always tilled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I've definitely mulched some
stuff, but I've only done I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: using grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't because they will regrow half the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, it's scary, too, because you might be
incorporating like some perennial grass
[SPEAKER_02]: with rhizome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're actually bringing it from
your own farm, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you feel like have you noticed like,
you know, you're the terpene expression in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants are better because of these
management practices like or just used to
[SPEAKER_00]: it because that's kind of some of the
feedback we're getting is that the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: are really stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just, you know, we're just working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys been doing since 2018?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventeen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventeen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably a bunch more questions
I'll think of later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I live like five minutes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought, you know, if we if we
didn't grow cannabis in a commercial way,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still want plants around the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one of the things that I've been
amazed at is it's the interaction with the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment that that plant has and the
beneficial insects it brings in is just
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's a benefit to the whole farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I would love it's too bad that we
actually have to keep it in this very
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled, contained, like you put it
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd actually love to have a couple
of plants there, a couple of plants there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love spread that love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing some auto flowers with
Humboldt seed the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been giving me some and I've loved
intercropping root or root vegetables with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this 50 foot row of carrots just
right next to the cannabis, the auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that the carrots all of the
above ground growth could create such a
[SPEAKER_01]: bank for lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lady beetles all over the whole
row of carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they all reproduced on the auto
flower leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all went from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the eggs were on the underside of all
the auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like blown away with how
amazing that intercropping system was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it required a lot of water and
fertilization where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I got hit with the gravel
bar of the River Terrace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to implement some other
practices, bringing in fertility with
[SPEAKER_01]: mulching.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I'm just really excited to
hear you guys' management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really beautiful example of closing
the loop and creating more regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: system that's long term regenerative,
not just sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we're actually doing this thing
where we're aging wood chips for about two
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're putting other farm grown
green manure cover crop, putting that in
[SPEAKER_02]: with the aged wood chips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trying to do like we're doing goat
manure and chicken bedding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're putting that all in and making
like a bio complete compost using Elaine
[SPEAKER_02]: Ingham soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually so right now the fertility
on the farm is actually 100% from the
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really is closed loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said goats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have goats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goats are tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walter was talking about, you know,
harvesting wood chips and then letting
[SPEAKER_01]: them sit in the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would collect them isilium
and then building.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys are creating like very unique
biodynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not biodynamic, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's, you know, the wood chips
and the biology from the forest and the
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi and everything like that's a huge
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the biodynamic compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yarrow, chamomile, valerian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's even more different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a different spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A spiritual path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow all those plants in our beds of
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're living plants all under.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's living under.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's herbs in the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is valerian and yarrow and all
those things like in underneath the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make you guys have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see photos of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever do take photos, I would put
them on Shaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I feel like I asked you a
ton of I bet you have tons of really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: management questions, methodology
questions that I could ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess for time's sake, maybe let's
think about your what do you think would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the one thing you'd change in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you had to change something with
education or regulation, you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: asking all the farmers like, what do you
feel like would most create the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: level of impact for the small cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: First regulation, then education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less barriers to entry and then,
you know, then take the time to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think they both think education.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of talk today about
like education for the dispensary level
[SPEAKER_01]: where THC shouldn't be as important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding more terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minor cannabinoids and all of that in
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then for the regulation side, there's been
all talk of direct to consumer sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously, eliminate cultivation
taxes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think something that might be unique to
us is like we've been exploring the new
[SPEAKER_02]: OCAL or OCAN.
[SPEAKER_02]: OCAL.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really hard because we're just
a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need the distributor to be
certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the processor to be certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're not, wow, they can't they
can't put that sticker on the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the distributor and processor also have
to be certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody along the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that we could get certified
and pay all this money to be certified,
[SPEAKER_02]: our cannabis would never say organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they do that in other agricultural
crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we've been certified
organic, you know, since the beginning and
[SPEAKER_02]: since the NOP, the National Organic
Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our farm is certified by CCOF.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back when it started, there were
certain things that like they made
[SPEAKER_02]: allowances for things like you couldn't
get organic seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were like, OK, if you can't find
organic seed, you can use a conventional
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as you are growing organic and
you could still call that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you grew a tomato from a conventional
seed, you could you could call it organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like little tweaks to the rules,
like that make all the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now they're trying to get
this organic certification for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: off the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're being so militant about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like tying one foot in arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, you know, everybody I'm sure has
been talking about how the small cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer is hurting right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here's something you could really
here's a certification that could really
[SPEAKER_02]: distinguish your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like and you can't go anywhere
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really lame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that processing and
distribution also don't forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget, they make they not only grow
really good cannabis, but they also grow
[SPEAKER_01]: really good peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of cannabis, actually,
do you have samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get some samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about the different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Sapphire Sue.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the Sapphire Sue, seven percent THC,
twenty two percent CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that sounds pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely as I get older with all my
sports related injuries and my just like
[SPEAKER_01]: joint sort of I'm leaning more towards the
higher CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a one to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that that that test was is basically
kind of like a two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a three to one almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one test kind of it varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it varies depending on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time when it was tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bio vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bio vortex strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sapphire Sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the farm favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually anybody who comes and
tries that loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are you just doing flower that
for that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is actually made into a BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody else did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that this year is going to be for
pre-rolls.
OK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one that's like the farm will
always grow that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such like the plant is so beautiful
that it's just we couldn't not leave it
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice takes weather like beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing about our farm is like
there's there's nothing we rely entirely
[SPEAKER_02]: on beneficial insects and and companion
planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably why I've got it's like I
must have gotten a download over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: few years because that's what I'm in love
with to use of the integrated system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're diversified as a farm,
we don't have to rely on one crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had years where the tomato is,
you know, get blight, but the peaches save
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had other years, you know,
that the peaches don't have a crop and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes save us or the melon save us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really with the cannabis, it's like my
concern about smoking other people's weed
[SPEAKER_02]: is like if they have to pull off that
crop, they're going to do everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: anything to pull off that crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with us, it's like there'll be some
I'm sure there'll be some year where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nothing there and that's OK
because we've got all these other things
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll save the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the shining model for the key
for understanding diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, I mean, really,
people, that's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biodiversity is the supreme ruler when you
understand if you're integrated,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're integrated with all those
systems, then you have the capacity for
[SPEAKER_01]: some to fail and still be, you know,
saving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maintain your high standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's the key to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to spray anything.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it would not feel good to spray
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would rather deal with it
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys feel like I mean, I could talk
to you for hours, probably.
What?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're not supposed to get too deep,
but what are your three or five favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: companion plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones do you like the most for
attracting beneficials?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a list.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on my list.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's top of the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then this year, I was amazed
at like the yarrow just kept flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just loved the mulch in the bed system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the yarrow, but I feel like it's
invasive a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creeps a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you can just pull little
edges of it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it's not a plant that's like
so hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like comfrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would never plant comfrey in the
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won't let me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its place, but not in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one is oregano.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
Time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a ton of oregano and thyme in our
house, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like oregano.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are all antimicrobial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it on a spiritual,
like an essence level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's an essence biochemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it has a biochemical
suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some research that shows it
repels insects, pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also got that small flower that a
lot of the beneficials love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: The honeybees, too, and the bumblebees go
nuts over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thyme, oregano, maybe one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosemary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a lot of rosemary.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the thing is, is you just come
in and whack it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes on to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll bloom several times in a summer,
which is really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's funny, because I've never
actually done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can cut rosemary back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we cut it right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have some other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some like whether it's day lilies
or that I'm still like, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: it does, but it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Japanese anemone is another one
that's in the batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's nice because it comes in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of a sudden you have these brand
new flowers in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: The successional blooming of the flowers
is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diversity of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each, you know, insect that wants what
it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing a lot of calendula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been receding a lot in borage,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one that I love on the farm that I
used to actually hurt my back one year
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling it because it frustrated me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and then I realized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fennel?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, chicory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicory used to come up in my lawn and I
hated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always trying to dig it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was looking for something like
what blooms late in the year that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to water, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I realized chicory, the thing is
that it blooms, it blooms every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, by the afternoon, if you're
walking around, it doesn't look like
[SPEAKER_02]: anything special, but it blooms every
morning and the wasps and bees are
[SPEAKER_02]: hovering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I went from being like on my most
hated list to like now it's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things I love the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, if they get more in tune with
their environment, they'll see that things
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't weeds or bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can have a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anywhere we can find your product
that you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been working with a brand
called Simple and they have created a
[SPEAKER_00]: little I guess they're eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is the canna dog is one we grew
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Sapphire Sue and the cherry lime
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have those at Urban Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban Market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Arcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sapphire Sue is the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think they also have it at the
high times dispensaries down in the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really kind of waiting for the
market to catch up to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The you know, until like people can get
that like, you know, what's the label?
[SPEAKER_02]: That says I'm a mom and pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the label?
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it's grown in in the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's the you know,
once this whole thing gets sorted out,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but like right now we have a fun
contract with seven ten labs and we had a
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice crop with them this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're sitting on a whole bunch of
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but like, you know, you guys are
diversified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All in due time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also it's like we said,
like we're not desperate to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also like aren't going to take a
price that's insulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty gnarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we delayed because I see you
might have other flour over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to let's look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is strawberry cake and that is
seed from Booney Acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Booney's got some good turf projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our highest like THC one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Andrew is Andrew the one doing all the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's doing a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we traded them strawberry cake for
those seeds because they do the Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took a whole bunch of rotten
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave them they gave us seed in
exchange for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that turned out really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like great structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard buds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I she makes me do a lot of the talking,
but this is really her project.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strawberry cake project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, no, the whole project.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other streams you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbert Frosting is a happy happy dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that was a fun one, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never did that one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the chirping performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one is a Bio Vortex Genetics
Cherry Lime Dog that we very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I get to smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep seeing it all over Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should get to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a beautiful one, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It finishes early and it's just and once
again, like the plant structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's almost like you don't have to do
anything to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it just grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jesse's breeding like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just designed for these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just taking very little off the,
you know, the branches before you hang
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a whole lot of water leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a whole lot of leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just dries super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Russell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
