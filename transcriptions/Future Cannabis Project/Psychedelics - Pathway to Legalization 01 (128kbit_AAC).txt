[SPEAKER_00]: I created a presentation that is going to
be kind of like the road to prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the path to legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you a little bit about myself
because we want this to be kind of like an
[SPEAKER_00]: open discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to disclose a few things
about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Stanford Law School after
college and you would think that Stanford
[SPEAKER_00]: Law School would be a pretty conservative
law school experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most law students it was, but for me,
it was very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were these housing cooperatives at
Stanford and one of them was named the
[SPEAKER_00]: Enchanted Broccoli Forest where my Keefe
dealer lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was exposed to the psychedelic
undergraduate and graduate culture at
[SPEAKER_00]: Stanford going there for law school.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a literary society called Alpha
Delta Phi, the Alpha Delts and they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different initiations which
consisted of going to the hills of
[SPEAKER_00]: Stanford where the dish, this is like a
radar dish, was located on a full moon and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking LSD and having an initiation
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was at Stanford, the DEA was on
to Stanford students synthesizing LSD so
[SPEAKER_00]: they would carefully control all the
precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: No precursors to get to Stanford,
all strictly controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stanford students would not be deterred
by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just invented new ways to synthesize
precursors and once they had their
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor, they would synthesize LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was in law school, you know,
in the spirit of like openness and
[SPEAKER_00]: disclosing my own psychedelic experiences,
I had the good fortune of having access to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the purest LSD at the time on
earth and it was all manufactured right on
[SPEAKER_00]: campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: By Stanford students, many who avidly
experimented with pure LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also took other psychedelics,
mushrooms, ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was legal back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hadn't yet been scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you that the intentional
use of psychedelics really enriched my
[SPEAKER_00]: life and was positive for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also tell you that I experimented
with William Blake's Maximum, the path of
[SPEAKER_00]: excess leads to the palace of wisdom and I
also learned through overindulgence the
[SPEAKER_00]: perils of straying too far with
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're gonna talk about the
etymology of the term psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad Peter asked me to do this
presentation because I really didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: where the word came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a word that was coined by Dr.
Humphrey Osmond.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a British born psychiatrist who
emigrated to Canada and he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: pioneering psychiatrist who did some of
the very first research with mescaline and
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also took peyote with members of the
Native American church and said it was not
[SPEAKER_00]: madness but a mystical experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is somebody who's not well known
to many people in the psychedelic world,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least not to me and it's somebody who
is very interesting and serves as an
[SPEAKER_00]: inspiration for future endeavors if you're
like a psychiatrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna hear from a psychiatrist who
is what I would consider maybe a modern
[SPEAKER_00]: day Humphrey Osmond, Dr. Cole Marta today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So psychedelics, how are they defined?
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the Oxford English
Dictionary, it's basically a drug which
[SPEAKER_00]: produces an alteration of the mind,
an apparent expansion of consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: often accompanied by hallucinations and
remember that reality is a consensual
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1953, Dr. Humphrey Osmond was in
correspondence with Aldous Huxley and
[SPEAKER_00]: Humphrey Osmond came out to the LA region
for a conference at which point he
[SPEAKER_00]: administered 400 milligrams of mescaline
to Aldous Huxley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aldous Huxley had his mind blown wide open
by this experience and he wrote about the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole mind opening experience in the Doors
of Perception which was a seminal work
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely informative and influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: He described staring at a bunch of flowers
and said, I was seeing what Adam had seen
[SPEAKER_00]: on the morning of his creation,
the miracle moment by moment of naked
[SPEAKER_00]: existence and I think if you have read
Naked Lunch, I think Naked Lunch is also
[SPEAKER_00]: describing that, looking at that in the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So William Blake also wrote about the
Doors of Perception and this influenced
[SPEAKER_00]: the title of the Huxley book and William
Blake who was tremendously influential,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Doors here in Venice, the Doors were
influenced by William Blake, that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the band, the Doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Doors of Perception were cleansed,
everything would appear to humans as it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, infinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For humans have closed themselves up till
they see all things through narrow chinks
[SPEAKER_00]: of their caverns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so psychedelics were a way to expand
awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huxley suggested a new word, phenerothime,
to describe substances like mescaline
[SPEAKER_00]: which expanded awareness and this is made
from the Greek terms that indicate reveal
[SPEAKER_00]: and spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a little poem to say,
to make this trivial world sublime,
[SPEAKER_00]: take half a gram of phenerothime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Osmond countered with a better one in
my opinion, to fathom hell or sore
[SPEAKER_00]: angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic
and that comes from psyche for mind and
[SPEAKER_00]: Delos for manifest and it's basically mind
manifesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the path to psychedelic prohibition
is kind of interesting and it involves
[SPEAKER_00]: Timothy Leary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1969, the US Supreme Court issued a
landmark opinion in Leary versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timothy Leary was being prosecuted for
violating the Federal Marijuana Tax Act
[SPEAKER_00]: which required him to file for a tax
stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't file for a tax stamp and he
said, I can't because it's illegal under
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be incriminating myself and this
would violate the Fifth Amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US Supreme Court, and this was the
Warren Court, agreed with them
[SPEAKER_00]: unanimously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given that it was illegal in Texas to
possess marijuana, then Timothy Leary
[SPEAKER_00]: would be incriminating himself if he
complied with the registration
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements of the Marijuana Tax Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the US Supreme Court invalidated the
Marijuana Tax Act, vacated the
[SPEAKER_00]: convictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the same time, the Summer of Love
was 1968, just right before then,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was like a conservative backlash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Congress replaced the Marijuana Tax
Act which was no longer enforceable
[SPEAKER_00]: because it violated the Fifth Amendment
with the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention and Control Act which was
signed into law by President Richard
[SPEAKER_00]: Nixon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Title two of this act was the Controlled
Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the birth of psychedelic
prohibition, the Controlled Substances Act
[SPEAKER_00]: of 1970 for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The isolated psychedelics had been
prohibited before that but this was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a widespread unitary statute
statutory prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it classified substances into one of
five schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule one has a high potential for
abuse, no accepted medical use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a high potential for addiction such
that the drug is not safe to use even
[SPEAKER_00]: under medical supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule two, high potential for abuse,
yes, sometimes accepted medical use with
[SPEAKER_00]: severe restrictions, and abuse can cause
severe addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule three, medium potential for
abuse, yes, accepted medical use,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can cause severe mental addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule four, low potential for abuse,
yes, accepted medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule five, the lowest potential for
abuse and it may lead to a mild mental or
[SPEAKER_00]: physical addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So schedule one controlled substances,
one of them which I don't think is
[SPEAKER_00]: physically addictive, cannabis was placed
into schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mild psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was Ibogaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like adding everything they
could think of into schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was MDMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mescaline which is the psychoactive
constituent of peyote and San Pedro
[SPEAKER_00]: cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as peyote itself which is sacred
to many Native American tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as psilocybin and psilocin which
are the psychoactive components of
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have a picture of cubensis but
there are literally dozens of mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: that are psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is the Controlled Substances
Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: The schedule one, they basically try to
add every single hallucinogenic substance
[SPEAKER_00]: they could think of to schedule one with
really no supporting research because a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these substances, they don't have a
high potential for abuse for the simple
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that bad trips happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a bad trip, people don't wanna
go back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the Controlled Substances
Act is how Kafkaesque and arbitrary it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocaine base which is crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: PCP and fentanyl are scheduled too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning even though they have a high
potential for abuse, yes there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted medical use with severe
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although abusing the drug can cause severe
physical and mental addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now marijuana is schedule one with no
accepted medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes no sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an old sob.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll move on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is never 100% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is like some percentage of THC
and then some CBD and a lot of terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dronabinol which is 100% THC,
that's just a schedule three controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's known as Maranol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then dronabinol in oral liquid form
that you can drink and get super duper
[SPEAKER_00]: high, that's a schedule two controlled
substance even though that's 100% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows how Kafkaesque this
whole classification of the schedules are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're gonna move on to kinda like the
federal mandatory minimums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of like this ridiculous
prohibition that we're living under.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the current state of the law right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a US Supreme Court case
that discussed the mandatory minimums for
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very briefly, the Chapman versus
United States case and I wanna say the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of the guy who was sentenced to a
mandatory minimum, Richard Chapman and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was selling a Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 sheets of 1,000 doses of blotter paper
containing LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to the US Supreme Court,
the weight of the LSD alone was 50
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams or 0.050 grams and the weight
of the LSD with the blotter was 5.7 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US Supreme Court held that the statute
requires the weight of the carrier medium
[SPEAKER_00]: to be included when determining the
appropriate sentence for trafficking in
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this construction is neither a
violation of due process nor
[SPEAKER_00]: unconstitutionally vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that basically meant that based on the
weight of the blotter paper, somebody was
[SPEAKER_00]: giving a mandatory minimum sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're curious what the mandatory
minimums are for LSD, and it's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic that is subject to the
mandatory minimums, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a mixture counting blotter paper of one
to nine grams is a five-year mandatory
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum for the first offense and a
10-year mandatory minimum for the second
[SPEAKER_00]: offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And curiously in the Chapman case,
the US Supreme Court said this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: because the LSD is impregnated into the
blotter paper and cannot be separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was in a bottle, liquid LSD,
then you would not count the weight of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a practical tip from the US
Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it in blotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it in a bottle liquid LSD so they
don't use the weight of the carrier medium
[SPEAKER_00]: against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the amount is 10 grams or more,
first time clean record, 10-year mandatory
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum, second offense, 20-year mandatory
minimum, and two or more priors,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically three strikes you're out,
life imprisonment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still have prisoners in federal
courts serving time for LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though people are engaging in
schedule one distribution of marijuana and
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooking the classification of
marijuana as schedule one, when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to enforcement of LSD, I think it's still
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen reduced enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you the good news is I haven't
really seen an LSD case in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There doesn't seem to be much interest in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're gonna discuss cannabis
legalization in California and what
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons can be learned from California for
thinking about how to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in California, it was the first state
in the nation that really kicked off this
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide cannabis legalization movement
with Proposition 215, which legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: medical use and cultivation with a
physician's recommendation or approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2004, the legislature passed Senate
Bill 420, which established the collective
[SPEAKER_00]: and cooperative defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, the caregiver defense
became increasingly rare because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: far more difficult to establish that one
was a caregiver than just to show that one
[SPEAKER_00]: was a member of a collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, in response to Proposition 19,
which would have legalized marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: the legislature, at the behest of Governor
Schwarzenegger, reduced the penalties for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana from a misdemeanor to an
infraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't really reduce the penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The penalty was already $100 fine,
no jail time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it did is it took away the right to a
jury trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my very first case was a marijuana
jury trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, processional lesson announced in
Van Nuys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a whole week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a hung jury.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prosecutor was furious that we didn't
plead guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can tell you,
like, it was better having possession be a
[SPEAKER_00]: misdemeanor than an infraction just
because you got a jury trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, the legislature just really got
sick of collectives and cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically said, this is a wild west.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to tame the wild tiger of
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they passed the Medical Marijuana
Regulation Safety Act, which established a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory framework for medical cannabis,
and also set up a sunset clause for
[SPEAKER_00]: collectives, basically an expiration date.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016, we have Prop 64, which was an adult
use regulatory framework with partial
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before Prop 64, cultivation of a single
plant was a felony, with a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: defense, but still a felony, often
prosecuted in court with a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: defense, and often ended up resolving as a
misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Prop 64, most cultivation became a
misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, a million plants now as
a misdemeanor if the person is over 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so law enforcement lost their
enthusiasm for prosecuting cannabis cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's still illegal, and now there's
like a regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2017, the legislature said,
we don't want to have a separate framework
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical and a separate set of
regulations for adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna unify both frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this resulted in the Medicinal and
Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety
[SPEAKER_00]: Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018, we had the state issuing licenses
for commercial cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulatory rulemaking began, and now we
have a new set of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, in January 9th, 2019,
the collective and cooperative defense
[SPEAKER_00]: will expire, and we can anticipate there's
gonna be an increase in enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way cannabis was legalized in
California, it was not legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a partial reduction in the
penalties, and then this onerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly regulated system that is akin to
the way that plutonium is regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why am I bringing this up?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are lessons that need to be learned
when we think about legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not repeat, not use the same model
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're gonna discuss the California
initiative process, because the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization was kicked off
worldwide was not by changing the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal representatives are not
responsive to the will of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was through voter initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was Prop 215 in 1996,
and the second one was Prop 64 in 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the legislature wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have the political will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel it's the same thing when it
comes to psychedelics and other controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not the will for politicians who
are constantly thinking about reelection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe this is something where the
citizens need to take the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initiative process in California,
to get an initiative on the ballot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need 5% of the people who voted for
governor, and at the very last election,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was November 6th, we had 7,213,464
people, so you really need 360,000 plus or
[SPEAKER_00]: minus signatures to get on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you draft the language of the
initiative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the California government code has
something very handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires the legislative council to
cooperate with proponents of an initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: in preparing the initiative when requested
in writing to do so by 25 or more
[SPEAKER_00]: electors, electors just means registered
voters, proposing the measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically 25 people would get
together, they would draft the language,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the initiative, and then you can go to
the legislative council, and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you come up with the language to
effectuate the aims of the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this incredibly helpful when I was
writing marijuana legalization initiatives
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2016, 2010, 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: I authored many, none of which got on the
ballot, but had they gotten on the ballot,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have seen more radical
legalization than what we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is to prevent people from
coming in with a, what if the UFOs land
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative, and would you please write an
initiative for the government when the
[SPEAKER_00]: UFOs land?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be something where the
legislative council thinks there's
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable probability that the measure
will be submitted to the voters of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state under the laws relating to the
submission of initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you gotta have a decent shot
at getting those signatures for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna be just writing
hypothetical initiatives or the
[SPEAKER_00]: unconstitutional initiative, the guy who
wanted to shoot gay people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislative council will not get
involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drafting the language of the initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with the legislative council,
as I have, there is a person who would be
[SPEAKER_00]: in charge of, I guess, helping people if
there was an initiative, and that's Jacob
[SPEAKER_00]: Henninger, and he has advised many
initiative drafters, and he is somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who I can tell you is receptive to the
idea of criminal justice reform,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he would be happy and honored to start
working on a psychedelic reform
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so an idea that I'm proposing is the
idea of a California cognitive liberty
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative, and this is based on a term
that was coined by Richard Glenn Barr and
[SPEAKER_00]: his partner, neuroethicist, Dr. Rice,
and Tensha, and they're founders of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofit Center for Cognitive Liberty and
Ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they came up with a really cool
idea, which I'd like to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the idea of cognitive liberty,
which is the right of each individual to
[SPEAKER_00]: think independently and autonomously,
to use the full power of his or her mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to engage in multiple modes of
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means the right to use controlled
substances to explore human consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also means the right to be autonomous
and not have the artificial drugging of
[SPEAKER_00]: people for psychiatric reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is like an initiative,
it's an idea whose time has come,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I asked Richard Glenn Barr,
will you come in here and will you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, no, I kind of moved on to
other things, but you can go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like you to kind of like,
if you can get a chance, please spread on
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea of cognitive liberty and just
start researching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great idea, it's kind of
libertarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that nobody should tell you
what to think and that these psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: substances give you the ability to have
completely different thoughts that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could not have otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's your right as a human being who
wants to engage in your exploration of
[SPEAKER_00]: your own consciousness to be allowed to
use these substances in the privacy of
[SPEAKER_00]: your own space as long as you hurt nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a very appealing idea,
and I want to spread that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this brings us back to Dr. Humphrey
Osmond, who thought that psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: could help humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he said, I believe that
psychedelics provide a chance,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps only a slender one, for homo
favor, that's like the human who builds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cunning, ruthless, foolhardy,
pleasure-greedy toolmaker to merge into
[SPEAKER_00]: that other creature whose presence we so
rashly presumed, homo sapiens,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wise, the understanding, the
compassionate, and whose fourfold vision,
[SPEAKER_00]: art, politics, science, and religion,
are one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the idea of,
you know, the promise of...
