[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to welcome Baron Nurada over
there from Marley Natural.
[SPEAKER_09]: Baron, introduce yourself and tell us
what's your title there.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Baron Nurada and I am the
marketing director at Marley Natural.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it real close to your mouth and talk a
little louder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marketing director at Marley Natural.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I'm Dave, the founder, CEO of Clay9.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cultivator.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Morgan Sokol, director of
compliance and regulatory affairs at
[SPEAKER_07]: MedMen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys can hang out of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we purposely chose this particular
group so that we could talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: about 2018, which is when we're looking at
hopefully licensing or starting to take
[SPEAKER_09]: applications for licensing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a representative from a brand,
a cultivation, and a retail and a
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's important that we all
take a look at what is going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I want to know is what are you guys
talking about at your quote Monday morning
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting around whatever kind of conference
room table you might possibly have in your
[SPEAKER_09]: environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to know a little bit of an insight
of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a quasi-regulated system right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a law that's partially in place.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have medical regulations that are going
to come down and start taking effect in
[SPEAKER_09]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_09]: Recreational marijuana that's going to
start taking effect in 2018, which
[SPEAKER_09]: probably will be late 2018.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't want anybody to get the idea
that it's going to be January anymore
[SPEAKER_09]: because it will not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And knowing that these are knobs to be
twisted still and to figure out how this
[SPEAKER_09]: is going, this is what I want to discuss
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're coming from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's start with Dave.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been a cultivator for about 20
years, maybe even more than 20 years at
[SPEAKER_09]: this point, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: The 1996.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so Prop 215.
Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: How convenient.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very safe answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's talk about testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's a big part of being a
cultivator is being able to properly test
[SPEAKER_09]: all of your product.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you see now?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you're going forward and
you're looking a year and a half to two
[SPEAKER_09]: years in advance, what kind of things are
going through your mind and what are you
[SPEAKER_09]: guys talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the biggest thing is clean room
technology for indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one benefit I think we have is we went
out of state in 2012 and we've been
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivating in a regulated space.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Arizona.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're cultivating in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're already kind of subject to the
state testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_10]: And having facilities in multiple states
really allows us to have two laboratories
[SPEAKER_10]: where we could do lots of testing on just
different procedures to dial in our
[SPEAKER_10]: protocols.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think a lot of what we've been doing
is kind of developing cultivation IP so
[SPEAKER_10]: that we could understand how to pass the
state testing, kind of the technologies we
[SPEAKER_10]: need.
[SPEAKER_10]: So our product could be safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one of the main things we've
been doing is developing the IP to compete
[SPEAKER_10]: in a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you do that when you're looking
at different states with multiple sets of
[SPEAKER_09]: laws?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the way that I look at it and
the way we're kind of looking at it as a
[SPEAKER_10]: company is what's the strictest
requirements on the books and let's shoot
[SPEAKER_10]: for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So we look at Oregon and say, okay,
basically you can't use any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't use any fungicides.
[SPEAKER_10]: You pretty much have to grow in a clean
room environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how do we survive in that market?
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could survive in that market,
we could survive in any market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so kind of that's the philosophy we're
taking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Baron, let's just talk about that as
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So as a brand, you guys have, you're
constantly having to pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_09]: current regulations, everything from
licensing, which will take a minute,
[SPEAKER_09]: and to packaging as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: What kinds of meetings and kinds of
thoughts and talks are you guys having at
[SPEAKER_09]: that conference room table right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: So with regulations changing consistently,
we're actually talking about the right
[SPEAKER_08]: partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: So looking for the right sources and
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't grow our own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our goal with our company is to support
entrepreneurs and cultivators and growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is our focus.
[SPEAKER_08]: We never wanted to grow our own product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marley Natural is about continuing Bob's
legacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you guys don't know, so the Marley
family approached Privateer Holdings about
[SPEAKER_08]: two years ago to develop a cannabis brand
because they wanted to continue his legacy
[SPEAKER_08]: and his message.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bob was an advocate for cannabis for 50
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're talking about is finding the
right partners and long-term partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are actually, you were talking
about restrictions.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are, our compliance team is very
strict.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't, our partnerships are very tight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's all about creating tight
partnerships, knowing who your partners
[SPEAKER_08]: are, and relying on them for long-term
growth, both for yourself and for their
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And have you guys increased your level of
compliance, let's say over the last year,
[SPEAKER_09]: in response to regulations and laws?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel like there's been a big shift?
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there another shift coming?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've always taken the slow approach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow slow, grow right, do it for the long
term.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been, you know, anticipating
regulations and just really planning to do
[SPEAKER_08]: everything really slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're in California right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you said, Oregon is really tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're planning to launch in Washington
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, the partners, the growers we
work with, work with, they're all natural.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're pesticide-free, they're
chemical-free.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really important to know exactly
who your partners are, your growers are,
[SPEAKER_08]: and continue that relationship.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me just touch on testing,
because we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that affect you, looking at all
the, you know, nebulas in the testing
[SPEAKER_08]: world right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we, you know, we find great partners
all the time, and we'll test products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they don't pass the test,
we can't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will not put it into the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be a loss for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we stand by our word and our
product, and that's all anyone can do
[SPEAKER_08]: that's in this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there's any, anything I can
recommend to everyone here is just be true
[SPEAKER_08]: to your product, and make sure you're
doing it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's too much to risk.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all here to advocate for a great
cause, and this is just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't, don't cut any corners.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great advice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's definitely, that one deserves
a hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Morgan, let's pass the mic over to Morgan.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Morgan, you're with MedMen.
[SPEAKER_09]: MedMen, for those of you who don't know,
is actually a corporate company that has
[SPEAKER_09]: several different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell us a little bit more about
that under the umbrella.
[SPEAKER_09]: But really, you are mostly dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you say that's correct?
[SPEAKER_09]: For this talk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: For this talk, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: So dispensaries are all about compliance
at this point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's happening at your Monday morning
meetings?
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I joke about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what are you guys talking about as to
how you've been operating, and then how
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going to have to change your
operations going forward, I would assume?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, I just want to say thank you so
much to Jackie and Women Grow for having
[SPEAKER_07]: me here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: MedMen is a cannabis management company,
and we have facilities throughout the
[SPEAKER_07]: country, and we're also an investment
firm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our flagship dispensary is in West
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the big things that we're doing
in preparing for 2018 is thinking about
[SPEAKER_07]: documentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kinds of standard operating
procedures can we have that give us a full
[SPEAKER_07]: picture of what our operations look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything from welcoming new members of
the organization into our collective,
[SPEAKER_07]: what does documentation look like,
how do we train our new employees,
[SPEAKER_07]: even thinking about emergency preparation,
fires, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in our experience, for the other
states where we've applied for licenses,
[SPEAKER_07]: the applications often ask for a full
packet of SOPs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to make sure we have those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing we do is create compliance
packets.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a dispensary in the city of Los
Angeles, so I literally took proposition
[SPEAKER_07]: D, went through every single compliance
measure in there, put it into an Excel
[SPEAKER_07]: spreadsheet, and made sure I had
documentation to back up every single
[SPEAKER_07]: thing, whether it was getting our business
tax registration certificate on time,
[SPEAKER_07]: checking physician recommendations to make
sure that those are all correct for our
[SPEAKER_07]: members, or having the right hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just making sure we have this full packet
so when the state releases its application
[SPEAKER_07]: and its regulations, we can present that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a really good advice for
everybody in this room, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: We get asked these questions a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's anything you could do for
yourself right now as a business,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you just don't know what's your next
step, listen to what Morgan said,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is do everything possible to get
every piece of documentation you might
[SPEAKER_09]: possibly need together now so that when
2018 comes around and they are ready,
[SPEAKER_09]: you literally can just hopefully go and
show up in line and make it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Understanding what those documents are is
challenging, but if you could start
[SPEAKER_09]: thinking like that, I think that's going
to be good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You mentioned something about training.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk about this a lot, but tender
training.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you say that in your retail
operations that you feel good about the
[SPEAKER_09]: but tender training?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I want to bring this up to all of
you guys because we're now getting into a
[SPEAKER_09]: place where, with recreational,
there's going to be a lot of people coming
[SPEAKER_09]: that don't know as much information as,
let's say, patients out there that have
[SPEAKER_09]: been maybe at this for a while and know
the questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_09]: But tenders need to be well-educated.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys do about that,
and are you going to set up any kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: training for them going forward that they
don't have now?
[SPEAKER_07]: We absolutely have trainings in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a system that we use to train all
of them in our standard operating
[SPEAKER_07]: procedures, and it actually provides them
a lot of quizzes that they then have to
[SPEAKER_07]: take, and we assess whether or not they
complete those.
[SPEAKER_07]: But another thing that I recommend for
businesses is to have someone dedicated to
[SPEAKER_07]: compliance, if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't need to be their full-time job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have a communications person or
a public relations person, and on top of
[SPEAKER_07]: that, they do compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: But having the buck stop with one person
in particular can be super helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: So around the November 8th election,
I wrote a bunch of memos for our but
[SPEAKER_07]: tenders so they could feel very informed
when patients walked in about how to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: to them about the upcoming election.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's pass the mic to Dave there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Dave, you don't really deal directly
with but tenders.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, not too often.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the stores, with retail,
you do, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So looking at what might possibly be the
distribution models coming down,
[SPEAKER_09]: how will that affect your business and
looking at how you do things now and how
[SPEAKER_09]: you might do things going forward to get
your product into the stores or into the
[SPEAKER_09]: hands of distributors?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you guys talking about in that
area?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what we're doing is a lot of data
collection.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said earlier, one of the benefits
that we have that we went out of state and
[SPEAKER_10]: we're attached to retail locations out of
state, and so we're able to kind of see
[SPEAKER_10]: how our breeding, so we do a lot of
breeding for specific strains for the
[SPEAKER_10]: retail market, and so we could kind of see
the trends in the retail market for
[SPEAKER_10]: specific genetics, for extraction,
and we bring that information back to kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of inform us on how we're going to proceed
on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really, I think, having the retail
data and using the retail data to inform
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of the protocols on the cultivation
side, instead of just kind of blindly
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivating.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but speaking of retail data,
do you feel like you're able to get that
[SPEAKER_09]: data?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You feel good about that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we feel really good about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, because that's important,
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Making sure if you're getting data that
it's quality data.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Phoenix, we have a dispensary
extraction and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all connected under one license,
so we have a lot of retail data.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, are you going to try to do something
similar here?
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, on the retail side, that's
probably what we're not going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking for partnerships with
investors or people on the retail side.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know our specialty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our talent is in cultivation, and so
that's what we're focusing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's pass that to Baron.
[SPEAKER_09]: Baron, as we're talking about compliance,
how much time do you guys spend,
[SPEAKER_09]: do you think, dealing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's Morgan saying you should have
somebody dedicated to compliance.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been changes that sometimes feel
daily.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you keep up with that as a brand,
especially when you have packaging?
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're generating lots of product,
and you're also having to manufacture this
[SPEAKER_09]: packaging on top of it, and then the
regulations change.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fortunate enough to have a couple of
people dedicated just to compliance,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I run everything by them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing I wanted to say about
Budtenders, Budtenders are king and queen
[SPEAKER_08]: of your business.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to bow down to your Budtenders.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't advertise, well, minimal ads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Minimal advertising, minimal marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Budtender is your spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell your product.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're your advocate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care of your Budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love your Budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: Respect your Budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be best friends with your Budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are any Budtenders here,
I bow down to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to do more with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we love Budtenders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Compliance.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a dedicated team.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is something very important to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't take it lightly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We invest a lot of time and energy in
everything we do and everything we say.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes through compliance, all of our
packaging.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working in a business that's still
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone can get shut down at any time,
and with our new administration,
[SPEAKER_08]: we just have to be careful with everything
we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to Budtenders, because I
think it's an interesting topic,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we don't really talk about that often.
[SPEAKER_09]: But some of us here spend time talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things that seems to be a
talk amongst regulators is maybe creating
[SPEAKER_09]: some kind of certification for Budtenders.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's take a quick poll in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people in here think Budtenders
should have a certification?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty much everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a process.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all Budtenders should go through a
training process.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're recommending medicine to people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there definitely needs to be a training
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a trust.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I go into a dispensary,
I'll go to a Budtender and ask them,
[SPEAKER_08]: let them know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I trust them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we do from a brand's perspective
is we go in there, and we try to educate
[SPEAKER_08]: them about our products and what our
products do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully, other brands and companies
do the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a thought on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Budtenders certification?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think on the cultivation side,
the cultivators take the plant very
[SPEAKER_10]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we spend many years developing
different strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: And studying terpene profiles and
different techniques.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of times, that doesn't carry
over to the other side.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of name game happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll develop something.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the name will switch when it goes
across to the retail side.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the more the Budtender knows about
terpenes and cannabinoids and potential
[SPEAKER_10]: interactions and negative and positive
effects, it's much better for the retail
[SPEAKER_10]: user.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Morgan?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a particular stance on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are operating in New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one of the most highly regulated
medical marijuana programs in the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually require pharmacists to
be on staff and on site at all times,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a pretty interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say, as we're waiting for the
regulations to come down, to look at other
[SPEAKER_07]: states and see how those regulations are
written so you can anticipate what
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially could come.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang on to the mic there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how will the new laws affect what skews
you guys put in your stores?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have X amount of skews right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm assuming you kind of have a finite
amount of shelf space until you can
[SPEAKER_09]: expand.
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you feel like the new laws are going
to change how you guys look at which
[SPEAKER_09]: products you're putting in your stores?
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, going back to testing, testing
results and things like that, and just
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of overall compliance, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens when somebody presents a
product to you that you guys aren't on
[SPEAKER_09]: board with?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we fully know the answer
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do know that the state's going to
require C2CL tracking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tracking it from the origin all the way
through the dispensary and it being
[SPEAKER_07]: purchased by a patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we developed our own software called
MyMedMen that allows us to do that kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: robust tracking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would just recommend for people to
think about your existing point of sale
[SPEAKER_07]: software.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can it eventually adapt to whatever the
state is going to require?
[SPEAKER_07]: And just be mindful of what those
potential regulations could look like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk a little bit about licensing
because I think pretty much everybody in
[SPEAKER_09]: the room is in one way, shape,
or form going to be trying to go for a
[SPEAKER_09]: license.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dave, if you don't mind jumping in on
this, in California, do you feel like
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going to take a wide approach and
try to apply for multiple licenses and see
[SPEAKER_09]: what you get?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you also, part two, are you going to
apply for medical licenses and
[SPEAKER_09]: recreational licenses?
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though we don't know if those things
can sit side by side just yet,
[SPEAKER_09]: what's sort of a strategy that you're
thinking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think because we don't know it's a
shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like, let's go for all of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And whatever works, when all the pieces
fall, then that's what we'll make a
[SPEAKER_10]: decision at that point.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think for licensing, it's just going
after opportunities that are available.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's an available opportunity for a
license, we're going to go after it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And until we know what the state's going
to do, we don't want to wait for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're just going after opportunities on
the licensing side.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Baron, what about morally natural?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you guys going to also do the same
thing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to go for multiple licenses,
do you think?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know that's not exactly your
role in the company, but I'm sure you've
[SPEAKER_09]: been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And medical versus recreational,
how does that factor in?
[SPEAKER_08]: That isn't my specialty.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I do know is we are going very
slow with everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to work out all the kinks
that come up with any cannabis business
[SPEAKER_08]: and really just kind of specialize in what
we do, work with our partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: And see where that grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, grow slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not trying to be this big company
too fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about the partnerships we have right
now and growing slow and having growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you guys in multiple states?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in California and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are launching in Washington this
spring.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so potentially plans for other states
down the line?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, with everything that's going on
in this country right now, it's slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's slow.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Morgan, let's pass this over to Morgan.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked a little bit about this before.
[SPEAKER_09]: What kinds of questions are you getting
from the customers in your stores?
[SPEAKER_09]: And how are you guys answering those?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm sure many of you in the room
know that just because Prop 64 passed
[SPEAKER_09]: doesn't mean you can actually sell
marijuana at this point to a 21-year-old.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not yet licensed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that particular piece of the law is not
legal yet until those licenses are issued.
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, there are many
operations around the state that have just
[SPEAKER_09]: decided to start selling recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the problem is that the customers
don't necessarily know any different.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just are kind of going with it and
following what the shop is saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you dealing with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the most common questions
we get is, do I need to renew my physician
[SPEAKER_07]: recommendation?
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially as I'm already a member of the
collective.
[SPEAKER_07]: And our answer is always yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We only have a license to operate a
medical marijuana collective.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will continue to be fulfilling that
and requiring all of our patients to have
[SPEAKER_07]: their updated physician recommendation,
valid identification, and be a resident of
[SPEAKER_07]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to hold you until
licenses are issued, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're looking at, again, sometime in
maybe late 2018 that they'll start to take
[SPEAKER_09]: applications and hopefully get some.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just to be clear, for this room,
everybody still needs their medical rec.
[SPEAKER_09]: So whether it's a pot lounge that
someone's having, you need your medical
[SPEAKER_09]: rec.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it's any dispensary, anything
you're doing that's cannabis-involved,
[SPEAKER_09]: you still need that rec.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to definitely hold for a
good year and a half, maybe two years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a question that we get asked a
lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_09]: What do your customers say to you?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a different kind of customer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they in the know, most of the people
who you deal with?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, most of the people we deal with,
just because we've been operating for
[SPEAKER_10]: quite some time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So everyone that we deal with for the most
part has been in the industry for many
[SPEAKER_10]: years.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, they're in the know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only question we really get is,
when are you going to have more product?
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is a good problem to have at this
point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the issue is keeping up, I think,
with the demand of the market exploding.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we know you're looking in other
states.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to continue to try to expand
that business to be able to help meet the
[SPEAKER_09]: need?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think California is our focus,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though we went out of state,
California is really, we know it's the
[SPEAKER_10]: place to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's where we started.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's where we're from.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is where we want to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Baron, are you guys, one of the things
you and I have talked about is your we'll
[SPEAKER_09]: call it giving back, giving back to the
community.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some of the things you're doing
now and looking down the road into 2018?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that going to change?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you doing now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we created a social impact
initiative called Rise Up before we even
[SPEAKER_08]: launched or sold a product in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is because we feel responsible to
this community, to the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_08]: and to give back to people that have been
harmed by cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first and foremost, we gave back to
Jamaica, Bob's homeland and the family's
[SPEAKER_08]: homeland.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we helped fund entrepreneurial
programs, sustainable farming programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then in the US, we're partnering with
the Minority Cannabis Business Association
[SPEAKER_08]: and Defy Ventures.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our goal is each new market that we
launch in, we give back to that market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the long-term goal is to continue our
advocacy work and help create
[SPEAKER_08]: entrepreneurial programs for people that
want to get into the industry and to help
[SPEAKER_08]: create an even playing field in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's so many stories.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are so many people that have been
harmed by cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we feel in our hearts that we need to
help those people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Oregon, we did an expungement
program.
[SPEAKER_08]: We helped expunge 25 records, and men and
women.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we paid for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got the lawyers for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's the least we can do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my passion, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's why I joined the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually worked for the Marley family
before getting into Marley Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_08]: Marley Natural.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was working for one of their other
companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was fascinated by the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like I wanted to be a part of a
community that is changing the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we actually are.
[SPEAKER_08]: In my lifetime, we'll see the end of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's something I never thought I'd
be able to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel very grateful to be in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like all I want to do is give
back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any programs that you do kind
of a giving back program?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the thing about cultivation is you
just kind of, by nature, have to employ
[SPEAKER_10]: lots of people with criminal records.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we've been giving back for many
years on that side.
[SPEAKER_10]: But out of state, we've definitely
employed veterans.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of old hydroponic equipment
that we've been building up over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're creating a program to give it to
dispensaries and collectives to donate to
[SPEAKER_10]: patients so they can start their own
grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: But those are the main two things we're
looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We hire veterans.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, we've been employing people
with records for many years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're giving back equipment and
teaching people how to grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, in Nevada, I've got to go back
to Vegas tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to be creating an education
program to help people with felony records
[SPEAKER_10]: so they can present it to the judge to
reduce their records.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's another thing I think that's
very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one note on that, for those who don't
know, in Prop 64 in California,
[SPEAKER_09]: it is now the law that if you have a prior
marijuana offense, that you will not be
[SPEAKER_09]: discriminated against when applying for a
license, and that you'll have every same
[SPEAKER_09]: opportunity to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even if it was just a small offense,
or a big one, and you were incarcerated
[SPEAKER_09]: for a felony, you are now able to apply
for a license.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another one that's going to get
fought.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the law, that is what it says.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always.
[SPEAKER_10]: Morgan.
[SPEAKER_10]: By nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to bring up a topic that
everybody seems to want to know about,
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's CBDs and THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So knowing that these regulations and laws
are still very nebulous, are you guys
[SPEAKER_09]: making any distinctions between CBD
products, THC products, as you're carrying
[SPEAKER_09]: them in your store and thinking about
stocking them on your shelves?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are you just kind of winging it?
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a variety of products,
whether it's just CBD products,
[SPEAKER_07]: or a mixture, or THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's largely dependent upon what
we see from our patient base, and what
[SPEAKER_07]: they tend to want, and that's what we
continue to stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that goes back to our software that we
have, and our point of sale system,
[SPEAKER_07]: and being able to review all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just in terms of compliance and
thinking about the future, in regards to
[SPEAKER_07]: that, one thing that's really important
for us is to craft our policy strategy and
[SPEAKER_07]: to think about our priorities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for us, one super important thing is
making sure that the state, while they are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to require a seat-to-sale tracking
software, that we are allowed to still
[SPEAKER_07]: have our own that could then roll up to
the states.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just think about what your policy
priorities are, and then how you can use
[SPEAKER_07]: your voice, whether it's through your city
council, or joining an existing trade
[SPEAKER_07]: organization, to get those important
things across.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting involved with your city councils,
we've talked about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you guys active as well, the other two
of you, in any kind of city councils,
[SPEAKER_09]: or just getting out in front of people
that are regulating?
[SPEAKER_10]: We hire people to help us with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're focused on cultivation, but on the
licensing side, yeah, we hire law firms,
[SPEAKER_10]: like Frontera Law, they're doing a lot of
hard work out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, so like I said, we focus on
cultivation, but we kind of contract out
[SPEAKER_10]: for those services.
[SPEAKER_08]: Barron, what about you guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm personally not in front of them,
but we have the right team members that
[SPEAKER_08]: are, definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the CBD THC discussion?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you guys have both?
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.
[SPEAKER_09]: You do?
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And do you ever make any distinctions
between that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the laws and everything are just
so questionable right now, and with the
[SPEAKER_09]: DEA doing what they just did with CBDs,
it's just a topic of discussion.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no actual answers yet,
but I'm just kind of curious if those
[SPEAKER_09]: conversations are happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, what was it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just about being able to safely carry CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of know what's going on with THC,
but with CBD, it's somewhat weirdly
[SPEAKER_08]: unanswered.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the person that would know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heavily rely on our team and our
compliance team that would investigate
[SPEAKER_08]: that further for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so the final thing I'm going to
talk to you guys about, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_09]: open it up to the audience for some
questions, is banking.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a problem for everybody,
we know this, but what conversations are
[SPEAKER_09]: you having right now, and how are you
dealing with banking, and looking forward,
[SPEAKER_09]: what are you anticipating?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that same question goes to all of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoever's got the mic can go first.
[SPEAKER_08]: So banking is not my specialty,
but I can tell you,
[SPEAKER_08]: we shouldn't try to rush this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about doing it right for everyone,
and the more time it takes, we need to get
[SPEAKER_08]: involved, we need to voice our opinion,
we need to let people know exactly what
[SPEAKER_08]: we're looking for, and what kind of
benefits we want as members of this
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not a rush game.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take our time with it, and do it
right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bank of Mattress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Banking is a huge priority for us,
and also thinking about federally,
[SPEAKER_07]: 280E, and the tax code, and all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: For what we decided is to join as many
organizations, as we can, to make our
[SPEAKER_07]: dollars, and also our voices stronger.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the city of Los Angeles,
we chose to be a part of UCBA,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's a ton of other trade
associations that you can be a part of,
[SPEAKER_07]: and at the federal level, we've become
members of NCIA, which is also pursuing
[SPEAKER_07]: the banking issue at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if, I just want to go across real
quick, and if you could give the small
[SPEAKER_09]: business owner something to think about,
something to chew on, from your
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective, because you guys are already
in business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of people in this room are not
yet in business, or are just starting,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they want to be in business.
[SPEAKER_09]: What advice and what thoughts and
suggestions do you have for that small
[SPEAKER_09]: business owner, from where you sit?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think largely documentation is super
important, and also research.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at how other states are handling
this, and see what could be transferable
[SPEAKER_07]: to you, what makes sense, do the robust
regulations in other states deter you,
[SPEAKER_07]: or are they actually something that you
can handle and take on, and then pursue
[SPEAKER_07]: that further?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, I mean, it's partially true,
the banker mattress thing, but I think in
[SPEAKER_10]: our situation, we kind of default to our
CPA, and we say, this is what we've done,
[SPEAKER_10]: you make us compliant.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'd like to say is, this isn't easy
at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should all be proud to be in it,
or to be smart enough to think about
[SPEAKER_08]: getting in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say, fight the fight,
it's worth it, and there's a bigger
[SPEAKER_08]: picture at hand, and we all have a chance
to get into this, and do it right,
[SPEAKER_08]: so don't give up.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great, thank you guys so much,
all of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're gonna take some questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kaz, that's fine too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned the NCIA handling banking at
a federal level, what other organizations
[SPEAKER_05]: are involved that we can be associated
with?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, so I would say, look at the
Marijuana Policy Project, they're doing an
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing job across the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: Locally, the LA Cannabis Task Force,
Southern California Coalition,
[SPEAKER_07]: Minority Alliance, those are all amazing
organizations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also CCIA, which is California Cannabis
Industry Association, so NCIA is the
[SPEAKER_09]: national, and then CCIA is the California
one, as well as the Drug Policy Alliance,
[SPEAKER_09]: who's very involved in the Prop 64 side,
so there's a lot of different places,
[SPEAKER_09]: but those are some really good ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, she's over there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have a question for Morgan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in, we have our LO50 tax bill
coming up on February 18th, 28th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of Prop 64, it's sort of changed
the rules, it looks like this city taxes
[SPEAKER_02]: taxation without representation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Curious what you guys are doing with that
at MedMen, paying it?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for the business tax registration
certificate specifically, we're just
[SPEAKER_07]: following what the Office of Finance is
saying, and we're gonna submit our
[SPEAKER_07]: payments, whatever, based on however they
define it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the Board of Equalization has
taken particular stances on Prop 64 and
[SPEAKER_07]: whether or not you have to charge sales
tax for medical marijuana, so I would just
[SPEAKER_07]: suggest looking at their website.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're largely going off of what those
agencies are telling us to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing the 6% and the 9%?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not part of the finance team,
so I don't specifically know but I would
[SPEAKER_07]: just defer to either your legal counsel,
your CPA, or you could even reach out
[SPEAKER_07]: directly to those agencies to see what
they recommend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I have a question for Dave.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're growing in Las Vegas and
Arizona, how do you transport it across
[SPEAKER_09]: state lines?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all individual entities,
so anything we grow in Arizona stays in
[SPEAKER_10]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything we grow in Nevada stays in
Nevada.
Got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no, yeah, no crossing of state
lines.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet, maybe in five years, but right
now, each cultivation is isolated within
[SPEAKER_10]: the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: And why can't we cross state lines?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a federal offense, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure everybody understands that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not cross state lines, whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree that budtenders are king and
queens, too, because every time I go into
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, they're just so knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it relates to training, can you make a
recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakster versus an online training
organization, because as a business owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I want to know everything
there is a note to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not familiar with those schools,
but I would rely on your partners,
[SPEAKER_08]: so your sourcing partners, your growers,
your vendors, your brands, to come in and
[SPEAKER_08]: educate your staff on their product.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the duty of your partners to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are, there's Oakster Dam,
that's one example.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's CCI.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody in the room know any others that
we can just shout out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Any sort of good cannabis training
programs?
[SPEAKER_09]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Green Flower Media, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_09]: 420 Learning Tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a couple of different places
that you can go and learn about this,
[SPEAKER_09]: but as far as actual budtender
certification programs, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_09]: they really actually exist yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that's being discussed
right now with regulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, my question is for Dave and Baron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you guys use to test your flower
and why?
[SPEAKER_10]: I use two labs, Excelsior, up in,
I think it's in Union City, and the
[SPEAKER_10]: workshop, Jeff Raber.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the two labs I use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in California?
[SPEAKER_10]: Here in California, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the other states, it's a little bit
hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would say in California,
those two labs are very, very legitimate,
[SPEAKER_10]: and they give you very scientific results
that are reliable.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the cultivation end, because we do a
lot of breeding, we're not really looking
[SPEAKER_10]: for the lab that give us the highest
results.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking for labs that give us real
accurate data.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you're looking for accurate
data, I would recommend those two labs,
[SPEAKER_10]: the workshop and Excelsior.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think workshop is about to reopen in
the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been kind of out of commission for
a minute, but definitely I would recommend
[SPEAKER_10]: the workshop and Excelsior.
[SPEAKER_09]: And work is spelled W-E-R-C.
[SPEAKER_09]: I defer to David.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we have a question up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, then there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I don't think it's a question,
but I just came back from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I'm from, but I live here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are selling CBD liquid in bottles at
the CVS store, and it's considered easy
[SPEAKER_04]: over-the-counter to get, and it's
considered a food item.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said it's easy to transport even.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it is a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of that, Penel?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the DEA just came down with a
ruling that makes CBD schedule one.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, I'm not 100% sure,
but I have lots of friends that have
[SPEAKER_10]: companies that were doing CBD extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they were importing a lot of CBD from
Europe, especially Germany, because the
[SPEAKER_10]: source is very clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think because of the DEA ruling,
I don't think you could export it or
[SPEAKER_10]: import CBD anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm not a lawyer, so maybe you could
ask someone else.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, actually you can import it still.
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as it's from the stocks of the
hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it has to be certified as that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Europe's CBD is excellent because you can
get it over-the-counter.
[SPEAKER_11]: The United States, we have not.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always been scheduled as a schedule
one, CBD has.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the DEA finally gave it a number.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason they gave it a number,
one of the reasons is to make it a
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_11]: So connect the dots there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're not enforcing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a couple of lawyers, a couple of big
law firms, Hoben Law is one of them,
[SPEAKER_11]: has actually filed paperwork against the
DEA.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see where that goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just clear it up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Hal.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a question over here in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my question is for Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with some of the larger cultivators
that I converse with, depending on how the
[SPEAKER_01]: state rolls out licensing and everyone
talks about the quick crunch and the
[SPEAKER_01]: shortage of product, everyone else is
talking about what happens a year later
[SPEAKER_01]: and the collapse of the commodities
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the general prediction on the
optimistic side I hear is 800 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the not so optimistic side,
400 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering what your thinking and your
feelings are.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think it's inevitable that there's
going to be a price collapse.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that low just because I
think there's a high enough demand for a
[SPEAKER_10]: higher end flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just the cost of production makes it
impossible to survive.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some data recently published by
Medical Marijuana Business Daily.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to think that Colorado is
probably one of the most saturated markets
[SPEAKER_10]: in America.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have something like 1,500
regulated commercial cultivators.
[SPEAKER_10]: And their average price dropped to about
1,500.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at 1,500, with a very efficient
commercial cultivation, you could still be
[SPEAKER_10]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think if they're still hitting that
number on average, and that includes
[SPEAKER_10]: outdoor, indoor is still, I think,
well above 1,500 for really high end.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you just have to make sure that you're
doing something unique.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing something boutique.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think you could still survive in
this market for several years,
[SPEAKER_10]: many years maybe, five, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on your website, it says you have
indoor production to seven cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not, I wish.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would just be our, that's the cost of
our new, of our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the total cost is way above that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The labor and the electricity and the,
yeah, the rent.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, that, that's just the nutrient
cost.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got time for one or two more questions
and then we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for a lot of us that are new to the
industry, do you recommend going in with a
[SPEAKER_06]: partner or someone who's been in the
industry already?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think that it's doable for us to
come in as newcomers and learn the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and maybe become a small business
owner?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all about partners, but you have to
know who your partner is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all about being independent as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And being a small business owner,
I believe you can do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really depends on who your partners
are.
[SPEAKER_08]: You really never know.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to vet everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's hard to say because I'm very,
you know, an exclusive industry side.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in my experience, it's definitely good
to at least pick the brain of someone
[SPEAKER_10]: who's been in the industry because it's,
it's a completely different industry than
[SPEAKER_10]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think you at least want some
perspective.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you necessarily have to
partner up with someone in the industry,
[SPEAKER_10]: but at least, you know, do, do diligence
and, and, and kind of talk to as many
[SPEAKER_10]: people as you can in the industry to get
some perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the real retail side, I would just say,
be careful about where you are entering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for West Hollywood, for example,
they've already given out the four
[SPEAKER_07]: licenses that they're going to be giving
for dispensaries for Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pretty iffy situation right now
with a measure N M M that's coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be two measures on the
ballot guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's measure M and measure N N though
is on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the UCBA one and that's not to be
voted on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it made the ballot and it's going to
be there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to get that straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: M is the one that people are really
looking at.
[SPEAKER_09]: N is the one that we're at least not
voting for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to enter Los Angeles is also kind of
iffy because it's unclear what the city
[SPEAKER_07]: council is going to determine for the
number of dispensaries that they're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to allow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just be mindful about what the existing
regulations are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, I am going to say thank you
to all three of these wonderful,
[SPEAKER_09]: wonderful people up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really, really informative,
really, really helpful for everybody to
[SPEAKER_09]: understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm assuming these three will be
floating around here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have more questions for them,
please feel free to ask them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
