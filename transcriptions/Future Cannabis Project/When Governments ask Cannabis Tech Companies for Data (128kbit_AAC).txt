[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're just talking about being
arrested and being put on a DEA list,
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we on a DEA list?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this came up the other day,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I strangely feel kind of good about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that I'm doing something enough
to be recognized in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question becomes, it's like,
what happens when, say it does become
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal, does that DEA list get
erased?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably all of a sudden the government
starts looking at that list to see who to
[SPEAKER_01]: tax, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that list becomes,
as far as making sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had someone the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone come to me the other day with a
request to work with us, to get licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, we want access to all of
your dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were a CPA firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, OK, well, talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you interested in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, well, the city's really
interested in finding out who's not paying
[SPEAKER_01]: their fair share of taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're leveraging your platform to
figure out how many sales they're doing to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-reference the taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shady.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you want me to narc out on my
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's going to look really good,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to make sure you're not
going to get sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, I was like, honestly,
that's just real shady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you don't want to do that as a
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we pay in our government for if
they can't figure that out themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, if they don't have the tech to do
it effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also potentially an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: True, but I think that's a...
[SPEAKER_01]: But isn't that what Metric should be
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shouldn't they be going to the companies
like Metric to say, hey, we need records
[SPEAKER_01]: on all these dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's paying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's not paying?
[SPEAKER_00]: From a data perspective, I could see the
government connecting with the data and
[SPEAKER_00]: even partially funding a data company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to be able to get access to all that
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Washington did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't necessarily partner with the
data company, but everything has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded through the state to have some
sort of a platform in which everything
[SPEAKER_00]: gets recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's public info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you really want to get it at
that bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you want to get the data
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise, you know as well as I
do how segmented this marketplace is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to work with a big
handful of companies to try to piece it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what LA did before
California went wreck in January?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LA posted a list of every single
dispensary, legal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're basically saying, we know who
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone got real scared about what
was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the worst thing that possibly
could have happened happened, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: that nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, all right, so now either
the government is underfunded or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: understaffed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they're understaffed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all know that they're under
tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question becomes, when are you
going to start seeing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think recently they actually did,
didn't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: They started doing some raids in the last
month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they kind of had to to make a
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
I don't know.
