[SPEAKER_00]: So finding an appropriate location to
operate your, whether it is 5,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet, 10,000 square foot canopy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're aligning this with state law or
up to 22,000 square foot canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in what location?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so knowing that you're gonna have to
have $70,000 set aside for application
[SPEAKER_00]: fees to the city, and that's broken up
into inspection fees and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but that probably will be about
that number, although we're again pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: for that hopefully to be lessened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is part of that political and
kind of advocacy dialogue that we continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today- So as of today, it seems like
either if you wanna grow in LA city,
[SPEAKER_01]: you gotta be bigger, you just gotta go
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of today, yeah, you need to have the
money to take you into the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market in the city of LA, which
incidentally seems rather antithetical to
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the lip service that is being
paid to the smaller operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: the former offenders, formerly
incarcerated folks, equity, however we end
[SPEAKER_00]: up defining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is probably going to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say that because we also have
advocates, even Council President Herb
[SPEAKER_00]: Wesson himself, who really does want to
see opportunities for smaller operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: for folks who would qualify for whatever
the social equity program looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's not the sole voice on the
council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, the cannabis department here in
the city of LA, is headed up by a woman
[SPEAKER_00]: whose name is Kat Packer, who comes from
Drug Policy Alliance, who also cares about
[SPEAKER_00]: these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned earlier, there are many
voices in this chorus, which is also all
[SPEAKER_00]: the more reason why we need to be involved
in this process, all the more reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: people need to actually show up to every
hearing, and why people need to write and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate with their city council
members and get involved in organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of checking out of this process
is, that is an old way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, as I've said to many of my
clients, don't complain to me that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like how things worked out in a
year, two years, three years, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not involved in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, we're all part of this
experiment, and we have the responsibility
[SPEAKER_00]: to be involved in this process,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, you see on a state
level, there are regulators and
[SPEAKER_00]: legislators who very much want to listen
to this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the same thing in the city of
Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also, again, be psychologically
smart and diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the things that are involved in a
conversation with another human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also part of this process,
and we're seeing that, thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, again, a lot of this
relationship that needs to be repaired
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cannabis community and elected
officials, city government, state
[SPEAKER_00]: government, law enforcement, et cetera,
and that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 10 years, it will be a world of
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm just, I am one of mine that
I want to help build this structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want us all to help build this
structure and to help infuse it with
[SPEAKER_00]: certain values that will really benefit
people in this industry and outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have a West Hollywood that
does allow some number of four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and is looking at allowing
labs and other types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and is looking at, you know,
these issues in a much more reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: and, in some regard, liberal way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like creative retail type operations.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, consumption bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of cultivation, there's a
city of Port Waineme that passed a local
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinance that seems on some level fairly
reasonable, but, you know, you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with, you know, it's still a
pretty voluminous application process and
[SPEAKER_00]: fees, and, you know, it's still
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, because I also have many good
friends and we have clients in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that seemed to be a pretty
straightforward process, and I did myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: although my law partner, Nicole,
handled most of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But worked with one of my old,
old friends on this process, and she
[SPEAKER_00]: applied for cultivation and manufacturing
there, and it was a pretty straightforward
[SPEAKER_00]: process in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Southern California, you know,
we're just, we're a little slower on all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this, and I look forward to six months
from now when I will probably be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer that question and give very shining
examples, and certainly two years and four
[SPEAKER_00]: years and five years from now,
we will have an incredibly, incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: different conversation when asked if I
want to or am cultivating cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, what do I do to follow all the
laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those rules and regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will all be set out, and it will
all be a very somewhat or much more
[SPEAKER_00]: well-oiled machine, and I will be able to
say, here's where you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what you'll see in this city,
in this county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the taxation structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the permitting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what it will likely cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the state licensing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what these fees and everything,
and here it will be all clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The path will be laid out, and it will be
a very, very different day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the chairwoman of the Los Angeles
Cannabis Task Force and founded that
[SPEAKER_00]: organization about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we really push the greenhouse
thing is we know that that will help our
[SPEAKER_00]: brothers and sisters in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: County with their whole local political
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cities and counties talk to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the League of Cities and CSAC,
and they look at what each other are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, and as folks in the industry,
advocates, lawyers, we also have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're going to be effective and
successful, collaborate, and thank
[SPEAKER_00]: goodness, most folks can kind of check
their egos at the door and recognize that
[SPEAKER_00]: this must be collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be listening and speaking,
building and action, but also non-action
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in this really historical time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: County, the current proposals are for
indoor only, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I believe so, and there's a huge
swath of the county where most of the ag
[SPEAKER_00]: land is located there that the county is
proposing to disallow cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that said, four weeks ago,
in the city of Los Angeles, the city's
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal was not for any business permit
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first draft regulations from the city
of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: said that these businesses are still
illegal, and we will only give you guys a
[SPEAKER_00]: limited immunity from criminal
prosecution.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's the whole old way of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we, through our organization,
through lobbying efforts, through talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with state regulators, through a massive
effort, through a public hearing where
[SPEAKER_00]: there were five overflow rooms,
you have the council president Wesson and
[SPEAKER_00]: three members of the council come out
publicly and writing letters to the
[SPEAKER_00]: planning department saying, go back and
redraft your proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people, this industry needs
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state has regulated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is thoroughly absurd in the city of Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you have two-thirds of the voters
voting for the Adult Use of Marijuana Act
[SPEAKER_00]: and 82% of the voters voting yes on
Measure M, which was a local initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: that specifically requested that the city
create a regulatory process and licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis businesses to come out with a
proposal where there is literally,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was language saying, these
businesses are still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a limited immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, action by people in the
industry, well-organized action,
[SPEAKER_00]: smart, good public policy-driven
arguments, and we will see, and we did see
[SPEAKER_00]: a redraft of the zoning ordinance assuming
permitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have permitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was done in a span of four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in LA County, there could be,
the next iteration could say, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what, maybe we should allow some- Of
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of our 40% agricultural land use for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I see over and over as someone
who devoted my practice to this fully,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I do all day long,
solely focusing on this industry 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a lot in California over
those 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all more than possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I see over and over again is
providing good information, accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: information, good reasoning behind why
this huge swath of land that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural area, why we should allow
well-regulated cannabis businesses to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk about what that would look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's come up with a comprehensive,
but also fair proposal that meets the
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of everyone over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see us in terms of that larger us
prevailing over and over because it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally our relationship to
marijuana, cannabis, hemp has
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internationally, the war on drugs has
failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, everyone,
people are into cannabis, whether it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: a cool factor, a medical factor,
the hemp issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're just, I mean, you know,
innumerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's about being smart,
strategic, and working very hard to push
[SPEAKER_00]: that ball forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an emerging industry, the law and
politics are not, it's not comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are growing pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over and over, it's, we went well past
that tipping point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly in California, when you have
the state passing and working on now for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost two years, a comprehensive set of
laws legalizing cannabis and regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and 16 plus state agencies
promulgating thousands of pages of rules
[SPEAKER_00]: and regulations, the state doing their
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will trickle down in some form or
fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this small like moment in time,
in this kind of bandwidth of like history
[SPEAKER_00]: making, being very involved in those
little, all of those 540 separate kingdoms
[SPEAKER_00]: in that process and giving information and
coming out and talking about these issues
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping to build those legal
structures on a local level so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can then ladder up to state licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is what people need to be focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't throw money at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't turn your head away from it and
hope that it will all work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you'll find yourself outside of the
legal market fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you better believe that when things
are totally clear that you are someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing cannabis with a state license
and a local permit or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just in a fully unregulated
gray black market that, that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that is not a place I would
certainly want to find myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want anyone to find themselves
in that place because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you can still under, under Mao
cursa, you can still be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, you can still get a felony for
cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems like that's being lost in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's it.
Okay.
