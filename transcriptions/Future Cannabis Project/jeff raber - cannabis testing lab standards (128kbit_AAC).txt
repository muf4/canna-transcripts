[SPEAKER_00]: So it's now 2015 and today fortunately we
see a number of states that require
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the hard work in talking to state
regulators and other lawmakers that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've required this element inside of
the new programs that have come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately it's still frustrating
from the lab perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being mandatory and required has brought
other types of players into the space,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no one has certified that they
actually do their scientific process the
[SPEAKER_00]: right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they're getting accurate,
reproducible, and valid numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the frustration is I have a bunch of
unsophisticated people who thought being a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab was a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a business stance it certainly is,
but technically it's exceptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a great deal of scientific acumen
to run this type of process the right way
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure your tests are accurate,
valid, and it requires a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cost to do that in the best possible
fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frustration that we have is that other
labs who don't understand those scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: principles or cutting corners are happy to
give high values for cannabinoid content,
[SPEAKER_00]: passing all the mold of microbiological
contaminations, have never found one in
[SPEAKER_00]: their existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gaining market share and having
all the clients go towards them because
[SPEAKER_00]: they know that they're going to get a big
number and be tested and be passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never going to have to reject
their lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never going to find out what's
actually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exceptionally frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working with regulators
especially in Washington to form
[SPEAKER_00]: proficiency testing protocols Colorado has
also added that to their regulations at my
[SPEAKER_00]: insistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be able to say these labs are
doing the right job or it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just paying someone to do something
and give you a false sense of security,
[SPEAKER_00]: an inaccurate number.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one should pay for any of that in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to continue to work hard and
really demonstrate that there's the right
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do this and I think through that
the quality will continue to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always difficult to be the ones at
the very top, but we're trying to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else up to that same level and
make sure all the labs are operating at
their best.
[SPEAKER_00]: The utmost, highest regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
