[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there it is October 30th so it's
Sunday we're almost done with October and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our African sativas are going real
strong so looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another field notes this
particular plant right here we've planted
[SPEAKER_00]: two of these but this is a Malawi but
specifically a Mulanye and I looked it up
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Mulanhe but I guess you pronounce it
actually Mulanye so trying to get all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pronunciations correct so anyway this is a
beautiful beautiful gorgeous land race
[SPEAKER_00]: from Malawi and yeah all I can say is
absolutely gorgeous gonna take a sniff and
[SPEAKER_00]: a close-up of that bud hopefully it's
going in focus and as you can see it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of that traditional African spear
shape I'm guessing it's gonna be about two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks so mid-November we'll probably be
harvesting these maybe as far as into
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanksgiving we'll see how quickly this
finishes up the top cola I would say is
[SPEAKER_00]: about 12 feet tall and then oh and the
smell
[SPEAKER_00]: very bizarre almost caramel caramel and
fruit yeah a week ago this was all rotten
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit but now it's developing like a
creamy caramel nose which is very bizarre
[SPEAKER_00]: let's smell this one to make sure now this
one's a little more spiced maybe each
[SPEAKER_00]: one's different now this one's got the
caramel again so anyway definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: caramel fruit thing going on which is
really actually unique for African sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: so anyway totally loving this plant as
well so and again we just want to honor
[SPEAKER_00]: all these plants so these came directly
from Malawi from Mulanhe area and so
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever if anyone because of the internet
if anyone sees this video who's from that
[SPEAKER_00]: area just yeah totally honored to grow
this beautiful plant and thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: these cool genetics love it thank you
