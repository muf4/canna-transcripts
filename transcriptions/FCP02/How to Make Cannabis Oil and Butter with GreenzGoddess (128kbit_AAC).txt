[SPEAKER_01]: Hey friends, Green Scott is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we are going to be making some
cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, what we're going to do is I got my
gloves on and I've been grinding down some
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty high grade marijuana here
organically grown by myself, pesticide,
[SPEAKER_01]: herbicide free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: No chemicals used to make this good
quality stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm doing right now is I'm kind of
breaking up these buds before I
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might go ahead and put their
weed in the oven first and then after
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylation, they break up the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I live, it's pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our buds are ready to be grinded up
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you lived in an environment where
it was very moist, it would be hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of grind all this up, especially
using like your gloves, your fingers or a
[SPEAKER_01]: grinder or scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just something to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless, before after decarbing,
we're going to grind up our buds just like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In here, I got about two ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to show you two different
ways of doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is my favorite way with coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another way is to make a cannabis
butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already have my oven preheated to 230.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a turkey bag and I put my cannabis
in the turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't do that, but I go get my
stuff tested over at the Good Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously this turkey bag's way huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size is this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it doesn't say a size,
just turkey size.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I use turkey bags and the
reason why I do this is because when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're decarboxing, decoxylating,
I was told that sometimes your turkeys and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot might get lost in the atmosphere
as it's heating up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way to hold on to all of that
and to keep it in the cannabis here is by
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it in a turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's two ounces of cannabis grind up
nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took out the majority of stems and
seeds, but there's still going to be some
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I place it on my cookie sheet just like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that this is a little puffy because
as it goes in the oven, the heat will make
[SPEAKER_01]: this puff out like a balloon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oven is ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put it in here and set the
timer for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to press start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to do this two ways,
one with butter and one with coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer using MCT coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stands for medium chain triglyceride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically this kind of coconut oil,
and it's very healthy for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it never solidifies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always stays in a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also this kind extra virgin
coconut oil, cold pressed, unrefined.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one smells so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is solidified right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the temperature is warm,
it'll become liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the temperature is cool, it'll become a
solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use this for certain ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I wanted to make creams or if I
wanted to make like cannabis capsules,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the cannabis medicine filling
capsules, I use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if I want to make brownies,
this is my favorite coconut oil to use to
[SPEAKER_01]: make brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going with a oil like method,
you could also use extra virgin olive oil
[SPEAKER_01]: if you wanted to use that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all great for cooking as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use this kind,
the cannabis needs something else to bind
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing people like to add is either
a sapphire oil or a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: sunflower oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much, probably just about a spoon
or two full with the whole entire thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing you could also do if you
don't want to do oil and you want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: butter, is grab, this is about a half a
pound, eight ounces of butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer goat's milk butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never tried it, yes,
I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we've got our oil cooking and
we're just going to wait when it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timer went off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to take it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got my Halloween oven mitt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it that time of year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to show you guys what it looks
like when you go take it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I mean by it puffs up like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want to touch this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not open it down on your counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it cool off for just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I turned my oven off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I filled up my crock pot with two cups of
my MCT coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could find this online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're using regular coconut oil,
I use two cups of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be two cups of coconut oil or
whatever oil you want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two cups for one ounce of freshly grinded
up weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to forget to put in my
spoonful of sapphire oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this set in my crock pot on low for
now, but as I'm cooking the cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it's going to be set on warm for about
four or five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and put this in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to get all warmed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I'm letting the weed cool off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the never tighten lid that I have
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so over here for the butter,
can you guys see butter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a double boiler and if you
don't have the double boiler set,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get yourself a regular pan and
put another pan on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have another pan the same size
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just using like a heat safe glass
dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chopped up my favorite butter into cubes
and this will help them melt faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going to carefully put that on there
and I'm going to turn this oven on as low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I want to get it boiling at
first, so I'm going to turn it up probably
[SPEAKER_01]: about a medium high heat until this water
starts boiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll probably turn it down just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want this boiling too crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a half a pound of butter in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people do a whole cup of water and I
don't really understand the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in a whole cup of water because in
the end they end up straining it anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of one whole cup, I'm just
going with three quarters of a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still want to follow the same recipe
that everyone else is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that they have a good reason why
they're doing it, but you'll see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end we end up straining this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping the butter and getting rid of the
excess water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to warm up and melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to warm up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get back at it and weigh out the
canvas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright friends, wheat is cooled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and weigh it just
because I want to make sure I'm putting
[SPEAKER_01]: half of this in my butter and the other
half in my coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go back real quick and talk
about decarbonizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what kind of cannabinoids
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people might be able to benefit
off of cannabis and its acidic form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore you may not need to
decarboxylate and a lot of people want to
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylate their THC converting it from
THC8 into THC when it gets decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way they get that nice high when
they're consuming this medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, when I typically make my oils,
I do a very, very, very light cook in the
[SPEAKER_01]: oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I have both the cannabinoids in
their acidic form and their converted form
[SPEAKER_01]: and it shows up on the test results when I
go to get the oil tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people like just having
edibles and getting really high off of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's you do the decarboxylation in
the oven for a 230 degrees for 30 to 40
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bit under two ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it took some weight off of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This already has my coconut oil,
a spoonful of safflower oil warmed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to put a little bit in here
and bring this back to weigh it to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I'm still doing good and not going
over too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that, a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that's about halfway there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other half I'm going to put
in this butter very carefully because my
[SPEAKER_01]: glass bowl, since I don't have a double
boiler, pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved this over here so that way,
I don't know something about this burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets real hot no matter how low
you put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus this way you guys could kind of see
the butter over here and then the coconut
[SPEAKER_01]: oil over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting my favorite spatula.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to blend this in over here
really nice and mix it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to be super careful
over here blending this in and mixing this
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people like to take, um,
their cheese cloth and like their decarbs
[SPEAKER_01]: grinded up cannabis and roll it in like a
burrito and wrap some twine around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an awesome idea, especially if you
want to be very, very neat and careful
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd highly recommend you go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me personally, I just like, I like the
cannabis being swished around in the
[SPEAKER_01]: butter or in the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way it gets to every single little
inch and piece and I'll strain it later
[SPEAKER_01]: through the cheese cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, some recipes, people will have it
wrapped up in a cheese cloth burrito.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just personally like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's nice and mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring you guys in for a close look.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is in the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely submerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to, I could add some more
cannabis on top of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's not decarbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get both benefits, THC, a and THC CBD,
a, and CBD, or if you've got a really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, CBG, a and CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is in the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's looking really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so close to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely say that, that one
ounce of, of, uh, decarbed cannabis per,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, eight ounces of butter is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my opinion, if I look in here and
this is just me, there's so much more
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: More weed could go in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go ahead and grind up
slightly decarb, a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, probably another ounce because I
just feel like another ounce can fit in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just say if you had one ounce of
weed and you wanted to do, hold on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get my phone straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say you had one ounce of weed
and you wanted to do one, um, maybe just
[SPEAKER_01]: one cup of oil instead of two cups of oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I mean, I got plenty of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's October.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've harvested a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I, I had a whole bunch from a friend
and that's what, uh, I'm using to make
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to go ahead and I need
my turkey bags pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grind up some more cannabis,
stick it in the oven, decarb it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's ready, I'm just going to put
it back in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, I'm just keeping an eye
on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you could see, I got my thermometer on
here at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The butter is on a medium high heat and
I'm just kind of watching it and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and making sure that this doesn't boil too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it to kind of stay nice and
warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to let this cook for four
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let this cook for four hours,
but I'm here hanging out in the kitchen
[SPEAKER_01]: all day and I'll be keeping an eye on it,
doing like this, just mixing it around and
[SPEAKER_01]: stirring it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being very, very, very careful because
this bowl is so small, but Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll bring you guys back in a little
bit later when probably we're about
[SPEAKER_01]: halfway through these four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So round two, I got another ounce of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decarved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and put it here in
the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one thing you really want to be
careful when you're a decarving weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking it in the oil or butter is,
uh, you want to make sure your windows are
[SPEAKER_01]: open because your house is going to get
stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be careful of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, um, if you're in your kitchen,
like any articles of clothing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll over you all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful where you're walking into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably wouldn't want to go anywhere near
a police station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smelling was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now in my crock pot, this is exactly
the consistency I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two cups of oil, two ounces of weed,
one spoonful of sapphire oil or sunflower
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you want to have this recipe,
then one cup of oil, one ounce of weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: half of a spoonful of sapphire oil or
sunflower oil, some type of legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is much nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is starting to get to a nice thick
ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an equal ratio in my opinion of
oil to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that also depends on the potency
you're kind of looking for, but me,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I could put more cannabis in,
I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to be careful not to put too much
butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking on point, staying nice and
thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving it a quick little stir.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I come in here and I just check
on it and I make sure that the water
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath is looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got water in this pot and,
um, it's sort of boiling, just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of boiling, not too crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My heat on the stove is at medium,
so we're looking really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's just say while I'm checking on
these and stirring every five,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, minutes, if I come and look here and
this water level is getting too low,
[SPEAKER_01]: then very carefully and only off of the
side, I'm going to pour just a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more water in here,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way that water level stays nice and
boiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mainly the steam off of it that
you're trying to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to keep this nice and melted
without overcooking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why they want you to use a
double boiler and make one if you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: in my case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's get a nice close up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stir it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so see how like the the cannabis is
just sitting there right at the very edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could smash it down a little bit if
you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like to scrape the sides of the
bowl after I stir it to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also decided to start using two
different spatulas, one for the butter,
[SPEAKER_01]: one for the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice and thick with this consistency
of cannabis to butter water ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just give it a little stir just like
that, just to kind of move things around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way things don't just quite settle in
one spot or settle on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing about getting these edges down
to get all the cannabis in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so basically that's what I'm going
to do for the next few hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an eye, stir, windows open.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just checking in on these and stirring
them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smelling really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stirring this one all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I'm noticing the water level is
getting very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to constantly check that
water level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to run out of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very carefully, I'm just pouring some
new water in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you heard that, the temperature went
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water is no longer boiling right
now because I had just added colder water
[SPEAKER_01]: to the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing it about a cup at a time,
just adding a cup at a time of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take one minute and then it'll get
back to boiling again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then stir this up in the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's real nice and thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all my constantly be doing this,
adding water, stirring, stirring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come back here like every 15 minutes
just to keep an eye on everything and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure we're still running smooth,
which is great because I tend to run out
[SPEAKER_01]: of water here about every 20 minutes or
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always had to keep refilling and I
could already hear it like a starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far we're doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just staying on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down my hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know what time I need to come back
and turn everything off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be about 2.30 my time and I'll bring
you guys back on when it's time to strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, friends, I think we're all
ready to go ahead and strain out our oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my coconut oil first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like having one of these bowls that has
a special lip to pour it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get a strainer like this
and place it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have some cheesecloth
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get like the unbleached kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour that on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a little hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me grab some gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's dump this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, helps if I take that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could wait for this to cool off if you
don't want to grab it while it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd actually highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just very carefully pouring all of
it in, including the cannabis material
[SPEAKER_01]: that's still in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm holding this with one arm,
and if this is too heavy for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might help if you have a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to use my spatula to scrape
all of the stuff off the sides of the bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the cannabis oil, this part's
actually pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only need to really strain it like
this once.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're done, you put your cannabis
oil in the mason jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for it to cool off and you could
store it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I like doing,
especially if I'm using.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I do with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, especially if I'm using like this kind
of coconut oil, I like grabbing these
[SPEAKER_01]: little packets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like grabbing these little packets
because they're you could find them at the
[SPEAKER_01]: store there for like sauces or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I was to store my after it's cooled
down, of course, I could store it in here,
[SPEAKER_01]: put these in the freezer, and any time I
want to make a recipe with some coconut
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, I just pull out one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are pretty cool if you wanted to
do that now very carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that sit for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to tie this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this I don't usually like squeeze
squeeze it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just let it sit for a while and drip and
and maybe I might push on it just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when all the oil has came out of here,
this can still be reused for other
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I typically do if I'm not needing it
immediately and I want to save it for
[SPEAKER_01]: another day is I'll put it in a Ziploc bag
after it's cooled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I put it in a Ziploc bag stick
in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing people can do is like put it on
an area that's aching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if your back's really aching,
you could put it on there or I would soak
[SPEAKER_01]: it like in a bath if I wanted to take like
a foot bath.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just soak your bath in some hot water and
then and then put this in there and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of your feet can absorb what
was left in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's how I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see how I don't wrap it up like a
burrito before in this cheesecloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like swirling it all around and
then putting it through the cheesecloth.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dripping, but I do want to show you
guys what it'll look like in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could take a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's a lot easier to take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pour it in your.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jar wherever you want to store it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an easy little hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say if you're using one of those smaller
bottles of oil like the extra virgin olive
[SPEAKER_01]: oil after it's cooled, pour it back into
that bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is this nice and dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: This because of the MCT coconut oil that I
used, that will always be in a liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I'm going to put that off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get every last inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now let's do the one for the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the butter when I'm using one of
these glass dishes, it's oven safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put that there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean this off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the strainer right on top of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my strain obviously kind of wants to
come down a little bit, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: prop it up on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get my piece of cheesecloth for the
butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I let it cool off a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grab that very carefully
as to not hurt myself or spill too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to let the butter go through
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about the butter is,
since we added some water to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is still kind of in here,
so we put it in this special dish here
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's got a lid I could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could put this dish in the fridge and
let it cool for about two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll come back later and the
butter will separate and come to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the water will be at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people squeeze this out too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this one you might need to squeeze
it because maybe the butter just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't want to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me show you what this one looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very carefully, because it's still
dripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could kind of already see a separation
starting to happen right there,
[SPEAKER_01]: huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let this drip for a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably end up squeezing the most of
the butter out and then I tie up the top
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I'll put this and the other one
in a Ziploc bag after they've cooled.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a lid on it and then I'll stick
it in the fridge for two hours and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: show you guys what that separation looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: With our coconut oil, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to let it sit with the lid
off and let it cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to wait a few minutes for
the butter and then we're going to stick
[SPEAKER_01]: the butter one in the fridge and then that
one will come back to it later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put on some gloves for
this part because as we squeeze the butter
[SPEAKER_01]: out, your skin can very easily absorb that
butter and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put on some gloves and
squeeze all the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to squeeze too hard,
but I do want to get all that butter out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tie this one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be saved for later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Butter fingers, dang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me show you what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been in the fridge for a couple
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how it's separated?
[SPEAKER_01]: So very carefully, I'm going to try and
get just the butter part out without
[SPEAKER_01]: splashing it back on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see if that worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm lifting it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice thick sheet of cannabis butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let this sit on a paper
towel, but just to give you enough close,
[SPEAKER_01]: still dripping everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to drip all over my
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of like a nice thin sheet
of butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put it on a plate with a
paper towel just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way the paper towel comes over the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This leftover bit right here, which is
mainly water, you could go ahead and do
[SPEAKER_01]: that same double boiler method we just did
earlier, pouring this liquid back into
[SPEAKER_01]: there and watching the whole thing cook
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll strain it all over through a cheese
cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll strain it through a cheese cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time, and then it'll separate
again, and then you'll keep the very last
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet of the butter on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has absorbed most of the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's this nice can of butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my other oil we had made today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been stored in the fridge for
about three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still liquidy, you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could keep it stored in the fridge and
they'll last a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can last longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just highly recommend that at least you
use your medicine within six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, like I was saying about that other
coconut, the one that gets solid when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: chilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays solid until you warm it up.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys had a wonderful time
making cannabis butter and cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody has ever done both
things on one video.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys liked what you watched today,
please give this video a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if there's any other different
methods that you like to do a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently on how you make oil or how you
make butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, I'm going to upload some
videos about how to use your oil to make
[SPEAKER_01]: cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I just like making brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like using it to make cream and
stuff for the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of oil, actually, I like using
this one to put into little capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to take capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's about it for this
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned, you guys, for the next ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
