[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, another African sativa field notes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Gambia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll pull up a map and show you where
Gambia is, but it's October 23rd,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this one is actually very close to
being finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has more of the traditional African
sativa, really sort of fluffy little
[SPEAKER_00]: spears going on, but the hairs are all
starting to brown up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only grew one of these plants this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were tougher to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have seeds though to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just kind of has a sort of fabric
softener kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly like old school bubblegum,
like bazooka bubblegum, sort of that spice
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of like a fabric softener,
like the old pink fabric softener from
[SPEAKER_00]: like the 70s and 80s that was liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that substance in a bottle,
but when it's coming from a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, smells interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, Gambia, very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be harvesting this before
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now it's October 23rd,
but cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very primitive, primal, almost bush,
bush plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Thanks for watching.
