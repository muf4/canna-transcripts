[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, Chad Westport here and I am
here to give you my updated impression of
[SPEAKER_00]: the SE5000 Lite from Spider Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now about six months ago I did an unboxing
video just kind of show you how to
[SPEAKER_00]: assemble it give you my immediate
impressions but I said that I wasn't ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to give it you know a two thumbs up or a
review at that point simply because I
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't used it yet and a good review you
gotta use it so I've used it and I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: two full runs under my belt using the
SE5000 Spider Farmer Lite and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty stoked I mean this is top of my
head this is all in one take because I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted my opinions just to be natural
didn't want to script or do anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that with this one but what can I say you
know I don't have expensive light meter to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you precise numbers with PAR in the
corners and in the center I don't have all
[SPEAKER_00]: that but I can tell you how the plants
performed for me now I also haven't used
[SPEAKER_00]: every single light that's out on the
market this is a 480 watt light so what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be doing is comparing it to
similar wattage lights that I've used in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past comparatively I'm stoked with
this one this one is a good one the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: overall they were happy you know when
you've used like Blurple or you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: HIDs and you switched lights you can
almost tell that plants for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: just like seem happier if that makes sense
to you but you look at your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just like you're happy today aren't
you so that's something that I could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you that I witnessed that I saw even with
the lights you know like right on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada I didn't witness any type of light
stress or burning of the leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: bleaching of the colas and again 480 watts
probably not gonna do that but still
[SPEAKER_00]: providing enough light to get me some nice
fat colas I didn't raise or lower it
[SPEAKER_00]: really I kind of let things grow up into
it I used the dimmer which I'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: here in a second and that's fine the
plants didn't really stretch too the light
[SPEAKER_00]: either see I mean they're kind of growing
nice and compact naturally how they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow how their you know genetic
morphology is it's not stretching up it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I'm getting enough right here we cool
I'll just grow slowly so that's that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: mention the dimmer though just kind of few
of the features that I liked about this
[SPEAKER_00]: light that I used you know pretty much all
lights are dimmable these days we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmer right up here so yeah that kicks
ass use that the driver too which it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: it's mounted right here for me I keep it
inside the tent but it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you come out outside of the tent if you
live in a really hot climate or you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the heat down in your tent where I
live I'm not too worried about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually for the winter it helps it offers
a little bit of heat it's not a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: heater but you also don't want it to be a
heater so there is an advantage to this
[SPEAKER_00]: light it runs relatively cool especially
for the wattage and the little trick for
[SPEAKER_00]: most LEDs if you dial it down to 80
percent the heat signature is half of what
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be if you turn that light up to a
hundred percent so keep that little trick
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind this light is no exception power
cord again it's long enough that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: mount it outside you can raise and lower
it without having to move your power strip
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to do that in the past if you
wanted to you know from your end of your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to the beginning your veg the
course too short so now you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: readjust your power strip and you got to
do everything no this got long enough cord
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for that spider farmer another
big advantage that I liked over the blur
[SPEAKER_00]: pools which was my introduction to the LED
world there's no fans there's no motors
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no humming there's no loud noise
it's a quiet light and you know to that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect too it's not really a power hog
either no noticeable like bump in my power
[SPEAKER_00]: bill switching from some smaller lights
multiple small smaller lights that equal
[SPEAKER_00]: the same wattage to the one big light of
that wattage now no big bump there so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool another thing that I really
like and this is kind of almost common for
[SPEAKER_00]: most lighting companies these days people
are going with the bar style lights after
[SPEAKER_00]: the blurple I moved into the quantum
boards which is just kind of a rectangle
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't cast the light as evenly as the
bar style does intended to create a hot
[SPEAKER_00]: spot in the middle but with the bars kind
of spread out the light disperses there's
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow in between I like it doesn't
create those hot spots as much so booyah
[SPEAKER_00]: to that also full coverage I'm in a four
by four tent okay so we got edge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: light edge of the tent edge of the light
edge of the tent safe distance away not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get too hot to start a fire or
nothing in the tent but it covers the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole footprint which is freaking rad no
dead spots maximize your space this light
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect for a four by four grow tent proof
is in the pudding right I mean here is
[SPEAKER_00]: some pictures of plants that I have grown
in here as you can see you know nice bud
[SPEAKER_00]: formations on this one nice chunky all the
way from the top to the bottom you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant here which is just a tricone
machine again all the way from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the bottom and here's some other
plants that I have grown in this tent
[SPEAKER_00]: under the SE 5000 light from spider farmer
and I tell you what no complaints here
[SPEAKER_00]: great smoke grow in the fire as you can
see to you know the light it gets good
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration that's something that you
always want to test how far into the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy is it going to go you don't want to
trim larf so you trim the bottoms up well
[SPEAKER_00]: where do you stop I think I found the
sweet spot with the light and it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty deep so stoked on that more bud the
better less trimming the better too so
[SPEAKER_00]: don't grow large everybody that's top of
my head I think that's kind of it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with this light it's a good
light it fits the tent keeps the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: happy grows me nice colas it gives me my
return after just two runs the light
[SPEAKER_00]: itself has already paid for itself with
the money that I've saved from going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and that weed sucks I grew the
fire here in my tent under the SE 5000
[SPEAKER_00]: spider farmer light and so should you
everybody overgrow grow your own at home
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are an important part of that so if
you're looking if you're curious if this
[SPEAKER_00]: one has been on your mind hey I'm stoked
with it I would definitely use it I spent
[SPEAKER_00]: money with spider farmer in the past
buying their lights this one comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: the factory I did not pay for that I want
to let you know again I did my research in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past I'm a frugal guy I choose where
to spend my money and spider farmer is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I spent it which is why they were
the one company I said yeah okay we can
[SPEAKER_00]: work together on the light thing because
I've been approached by many they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: only ones I said yes to and that's for a
reason so if you have any specific
[SPEAKER_00]: questions hit me up in the comments if you
have your own experience with these lights
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe compared to something else if you
went here went there and then came back
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know that's what the comments are
for so I appreciate your time today I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: this was beneficial for anybody and
everybody again specific questions hit me
[SPEAKER_00]: up I'm happy to answer them but in the
meantime you can catch me on my website
