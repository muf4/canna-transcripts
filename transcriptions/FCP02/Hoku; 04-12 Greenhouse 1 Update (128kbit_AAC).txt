[SPEAKER_00]: What up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd do a garden update this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little while as it usually is,
but kind of had a rough start to the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally got everything switched over to
the big pots and had a pretty good cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I decided to spray the weeds on
the side of my greenhouse with some 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants did not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overspray got caught in the fans and fried
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you do in farming, I had to make the
tough decision whether to replant or try
[SPEAKER_00]: and nurse those along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since they were already in like the
first week of flowering, I just decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: cull everything and restart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately I had a couple of trays of
some plants and planted those and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: already flipped again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set me back, I don't know, a month or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure it's not the first time,
or I'm sure it's not the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we got some auto projects
going in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pollinated and see the pollen
sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spray everything down here in
a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely learned a lot from the
first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had kind of the plants overplanted,
overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're doing like three plants per
pot in the 200s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some singles, which we're doing
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, stoked for this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these big pots have definitely
been a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to 10 gallons and plants just
don't grow as quick and don't get as big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, if you take your eyes off
them for a second, they've gained a foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lights are coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff will be ready beginning of
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: But got some Adis Code, doing a big
phenohunt of Adis Code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also OZ Hayes, which is probably one of my
favorite crosses from the OZ series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then got some stuff on that back row.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, here we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't even sprayed this crop once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't had any pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just watered in some nematodes for the
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like all this clover is starting to
die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess technically this is like my
second cycle in this greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I didn't finish the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, got to finish bamboo-ing
everything, trying to move away from
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I just made myself a lot more
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, greenhouse number one is all
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can head over to greenhouse number two,
which I direct so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured I'd do a little auto project in
here before everything gets going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not getting the best light, but enough to
play around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely running less plants,
but I think I'll be able to see their true
[SPEAKER_00]: expression as far as morphology and how
they want to grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: See some of these are kind of lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm just running three different
cultivars in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see how everything does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hop over to the next greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
