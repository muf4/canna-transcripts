[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually going to kick off a little
early here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually got the studio opened earlier
than planned, but in all good faith,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are going to kick off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really stoked, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a few things on the docket.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have several guests which are popping
in just now that are going to be joining
[SPEAKER_02]: us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quick, want to get into some
housekeeping before the official start.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Lance Lambert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also the chief marketing officer here
at Grove Bags based out of California,
[SPEAKER_02]: our headquarters being based out of Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really stoked again for doing a
webinar centric around 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to get into that in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see for the attendees that are
already here, there is a Q&A section on
[SPEAKER_02]: the left-hand side of your screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any comments or questions,
feel free to pitch up in there any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few of our teammates that are
already in the attendee list that can
[SPEAKER_02]: answer any questions that you might have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to pop those up any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also reference a few of the
questions if we have time at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the session.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to keep this at about 15
minutes though, because we know time is
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable and everyone has a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, we'll get into obviously,
again, like we discussed, talking about a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of history of 420, a nod to
this traditional official holiday,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least to our industry and our
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to segue into why all
these folks are joining us, which are some
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome faces, some good friends,
some new friends that I've gotten to meet
[SPEAKER_02]: and make out of this actual video that we
put together, this documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get into the why, the how,
the where, the when on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously get ready for the
premiere, which is occurring officially on
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very stoked for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, let me do some introductions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys know everyone in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm first going to introduce Strawns van
der Plo, who's with Paragraphic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the man that was behind the camera,
the director, the producer of this
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that haven't heard of
Paragraphic, it is a phenomenal YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel that has some great content.
[SPEAKER_02]: My gosh, I think his top video is about
8.6 million views.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely have a pretty engaged
audience there and cover some really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got familiar with his content
before I got familiar with him and we
[SPEAKER_02]: became friends, but was really impressed
with his storytelling capabilities behind
[SPEAKER_02]: the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm stoked to have you here,
Strawns.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also go down the list here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Natal Partansky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not often that you have a rocket
scientist in a webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Natal, you have a phenomenal history
of anyone that's not familiar with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely look up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done some great articles lately that
cover his background and his transition
[SPEAKER_02]: into our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's with Sorting Robotics, also based out
here in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have Katie Enright from Lavinia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very happy to have you join us as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: A new friend of me, which I got to meet
thanks to the documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to hearing a little
bit more about your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, we have Evan Enneman of Sands Lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, phenomenal insight that you shared
during the documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to give too much away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will share the sizzle reel on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he has some really great insight on
the industry and what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next is Kevin Suratowski.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually represents pre-stration
extraction, but has more recently gone
[SPEAKER_02]: into consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a plethora of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, love his angle and his perspective
on some insight throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have Cory Zeila, who is with Tioga
Greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another interesting story.
[SPEAKER_02]: These individuals are coming from all
different angles of this community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, Cory owns a dispensary right
outside of the gateway to Yosemite
[SPEAKER_02]: National Park here in California,
which is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the brands you represent,
the people you meet from around the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: you touched on that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he might have his camera off,
but I think he's hiding behind the J.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jason D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington is with Culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond being a social equity license
holder here in California, he has a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things going on in the international
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also has some presence in Montana,
but a lot of great insight on what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on, not just domestically, but abroad,
which he touched on as well in this
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last, we have Jack Grover, who is our
founder and CEO at Grove Bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, plethora of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And background, very passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like myself, he actually started out
as a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was so passionate about the plant and
wanting to support it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came up with the technology we now
offer today in our packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stoked to have him on as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you all again for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for several of you, I know you're
probably familiar with this story,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I thought I kind of start off with the
history of 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hits a little close to home for me,
being a NorCal kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually grew up first in Marin County.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that don't know, that's actually
where it all began.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 420 started in San Rafael, at San
Rafael High School.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're familiar with the Bay Area,
essentially if you're in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd cross over what we call the gate or
the Golden Gate Bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Marin County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come into Marin and you kind of pop right
into San Rafael, just north of Sausalito.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great little town.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is back in 1971, a group of five
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd catch up and hang out the statue
every day after school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of ended up being a bit of an
adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do these kind of safaris,
as they call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ended up coining them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the safaris they got best known for
is finding an old grow operations out in
[SPEAKER_02]: Stetson Beach on the hillside that
supposedly an individual is tied to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was the Coast Guard that had
this little grow up on the hill,
[SPEAKER_02]: not far from his office.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never did find the grow, but the rest
is kind of history as far as how one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the individuals ended up becoming a roadie
for the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 70s, and then 420 ended up on a
flyer, I want to say as back in the 80s,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just kind of perpetuated from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an interesting past, and I think
the thing to call out is the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very close to home as far as where a
lot of the culture and craft is,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California, everyone knows of the
Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Mendocino, Trinity, and Humboldt
counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, I'm totally biased.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the most beautiful side of
California is north of San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_02]: from Stetson Beach to Crescent Bay,
and that obviously is where the triangle
[SPEAKER_02]: falls in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 420 has really become recognized,
not just domestically, but
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys saw the footage, and a few of
you were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Jason was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corey was out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some individuals made it out to
Spannibus, which is an annual
[SPEAKER_02]: international event, started out as a
protestable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a balance of consumer and B2B
that takes place out in Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was interesting to hear people
reference and talk about 420 coming up,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's something, for those that
don't know, it wasn't really on
[SPEAKER_02]: international radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a handful of years ago, you want to
go over to Europe, you want to go over to
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand or down to South America,
and hear people that were tied to this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant reference this very popular domestic
holiday that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 420 has definitely come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with this documentary, and again,
we'll get further into that later on,
[SPEAKER_02]: we felt that it was an ideal time to
actually launch this during 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it talks a little bit more so
about the current state of our community,
[SPEAKER_02]: of this industry that is legal cannabis,
it's still something that all of us
[SPEAKER_02]: acknowledge as being that big day every
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it felt just fitting, again,
when Strauss and I connected on the
[SPEAKER_02]: release date, for it to literally be on
420, because so much goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of you know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure some of you are going to New York
for the big event out there, or going to
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Street out here in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe even you're going to Hippie Hill
up in San Francisco, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: longest running 420 festivals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's always something going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that, I kind of want to jump in,
and I want to find out from our panelists,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, if you will, kind of what 420
means to you, and then kind of segue into
[SPEAKER_02]: that, what got you into this space,
what got you into this community,
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry, and what you're passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's fair to start with ladies
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So may if we kick it off with you,
Katie, if that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: 420 has always meant a lot to me because
it's my little sister's birthday,
[SPEAKER_09]: my parents anniversary, and then my other
sister's anniversary.
[SPEAKER_09]: So even from like four years old,
420 was always a date that we really
[SPEAKER_09]: celebrated, which is kind of fun that now
I'm in the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I celebrate as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually studied theology and almost
became a nun.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my way into cannabis is a little bit
different than probably most.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was training for my second marathon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my first marathon, I had a terrible
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just not something your body
is designed to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was having back pain, knee pain,
all the pains.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for my second marathon, I was
determined to not have as much trouble as
[SPEAKER_09]: I had during my first.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I started to incorporate cannabis in my
recovery and started to actually formulate
[SPEAKER_09]: a plan for recovery in my training.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I started to make my own balms just in
my kitchen for myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, do infusions of
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did a bunch of research and I
watched like every webinar, every
[SPEAKER_09]: tutorial, everything you could possibly
imagine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I literally was just making it for
myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: I realized you could totally use this to
enhance your sexual experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried it and it really worked,
but I was using coconut oil as my base and
[SPEAKER_09]: coconut oil isn't good for a lubricant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I literally the next day went to three
dispensaries in my area to try to find a
[SPEAKER_09]: product that would enhance my sexual
experience that wasn't coconut oil based.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just started making it for myself in
my kitchen and for friends of friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all of a sudden somebody came up
to me and was like, are you the weed girl?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: This needs to be accompanied.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if people are hearing about the
product and requesting it, and then I just
[SPEAKER_09]: started out on this journey to start a
company that enhances people's sex life
[SPEAKER_09]: through cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting that point,
because like you said, there's people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't realize that this is a medicine on
so many different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an advocate advocate as I know Jack
and Corey from a medicinal standpoint
[SPEAKER_02]: first, but so many different ways that it
can be used and so many different things
[SPEAKER_02]: that it enhances.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people forget that it's not all
about the psychological.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's so much more physically
that it can contribute to.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as a better lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, you'll never forget this
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always something going on for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a good segue then to is to
Corey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Corey, a little bit of background and
you've got an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely love to hear yours as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 420 for me means a couple different
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll start with the way I got into
cannabis first.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll kind of play my story into 420
for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up skiing.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a professional athlete.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was injured at age around 14,
I want to say in middle school,
[SPEAKER_07]: I broke my neck and I found out I was
allergic to opiates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we all know, our country is the
biggest pumper of opiates and narcotics
[SPEAKER_07]: for pain instead of resorting to the more
holistic way of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so luckily, my dad is a dentist and he
has medical background, but he's
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely more of the holistic way and
definitely grew up in the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's all peace and love and has a lot of
friends that have been in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of his friends just always had
suggested that I use low THC, high CBD for
[SPEAKER_07]: my pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really how I got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also noticed, though, that it really
helped with my mental psyche and just like
[SPEAKER_07]: competing and stuff, getting me in the
right state of mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Muscle recovery was much faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like Katie had said, you know,
I started using rubs back then for pain
[SPEAKER_07]: relief and things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just making them at home, like she said.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really where cannabis started
for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just kind of really exploded from
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw the benefits of it and how it helped
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after I kind of tapered out of my
skiing career, I started medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: doctor offices in remote places.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would work with like five
different doctors.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd set up satellite offices and kind of
started the future of telemedicine and
[SPEAKER_07]: people being able to get their
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And remote towns.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I learned a lot from all the doctors
and what different cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes really help with different
ailments and things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I've kind of taken that side of
things and brought it into my dispensary,
[SPEAKER_07]: like Lance said, which is located at the
entrance to Yosemite National Park,
[SPEAKER_07]: right on Highway 395 and 120.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so our whole program here is more
about the healing and helping of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, we have products that get
you high as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're more of the compassionate side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very interesting, like you'll see
in the documentary.
[SPEAKER_07]: The doctors around here at our hospitals
and just main doctor offices will actually
[SPEAKER_07]: send people to come talk to me instead of
prescribing them pharmaceuticals these
[SPEAKER_07]: days.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty cool that our community in
these little small towns have really
[SPEAKER_07]: looked outside the box of the normal of
just prescribing pills and looking to more
[SPEAKER_07]: holistic treatments for people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've helped a lot of people
have gone through serious chronic pain to
[SPEAKER_07]: stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had people that have been able to
recover from stage four cancer and beat it
[SPEAKER_07]: using RSO in different various ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for 420 for me, it usually means
nowadays a pretty crazy day at our
[SPEAKER_07]: business, but a time to give back to our
community.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a good relationship with all of
our brands and all of our brands have been
[SPEAKER_07]: very supportive this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they send us lots of products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a good time of year to really
support the people that support us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if people don't have money
on that day, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: You come in with a dollar.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to leave with a fat bag of
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's just about giving back and
camaraderie between people and just
[SPEAKER_07]: helping educate people and showing love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to go the other extreme
because this is I love just to show the
[SPEAKER_02]: again, the diversity of everyone that was
involved in this documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Natal and I kind of joked around about
it, but I mean, honestly, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you come from a totally different
place, but I know passion in your
[SPEAKER_02]: association with the plant played a role
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was kind of thinking about that
as Cor is going over his back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow, I'm very on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I thought about this question a
lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what 420 means to me, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time I ever heard it was when I
was in college and some guys were like,
[SPEAKER_06]: dude, it's 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I have no idea what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was very much back then,
like 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even in California, 15 years ago,
cannabis was still very deeply
[SPEAKER_06]: stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was one of those people on the other
side of the fence where I was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 420 number to me back then kind of
meant like the stigma that still kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: survives today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, you know, this like illegal
stuff since that's like negative and has
[SPEAKER_06]: all these negative effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And over the course of the past 15 years,
it's evolved for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's changed from, oh, that's what the
guys in high school do who don't get good
[SPEAKER_06]: grades.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hang out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then as it evolved in college,
I became much more familiar with the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: and I actually ended up preferring it more
than alcohol when all my friends were
[SPEAKER_06]: binge drinking and throwing up and dying
in the corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, I just want to like
chill.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I think it's useful for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started looking into more of the
science behind it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh, this is actually very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the longest time, I wanted to do
something in the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I thought of cannabis,
it was like this illegal thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wasn't an aerospace engineer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked at NASA.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really go onto that other side of
the fence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when it became legal,
like 420 changed for me, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no longer like this thing that like
is taboo or prohibited for me to engage
[SPEAKER_06]: in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a few years went by and I started
this company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was much more familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had friends that were starting companies
around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then 420 now, instead of being this
like negative connotation, it was a change
[SPEAKER_06]: in the paradigm and an opportunity to
explore new avenues.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now when I look at cannabis from a
science perspective, I went to the Emerald
[SPEAKER_06]: Science Conference a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's actual real science being done
with cannabis and quantitative measure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're no longer in the world of some guy
who's like, yo, my indoor so fire cures
[SPEAKER_06]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no, they're actually testing
synthetic cannabinoids to shrink tumor
[SPEAKER_06]: cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I think of 420 now, I don't think
of it's those guys in the back of the
[SPEAKER_06]: class fucking up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, no, 420 is the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a completely different
perspective on how you can build your life
[SPEAKER_06]: and how it will change other people's
lives above and beyond California,
[SPEAKER_06]: United States globally.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of my perspective when I
think of 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think about it negatively.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think about it now as like it's a
positive future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've done a few of the Cannapack
events together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're one individual that I can
always find next to the infused beverages
[SPEAKER_02]: along with myself, because I'm like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm opinionated of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do reference alcohol as poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also gave it up as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw there are no health attributes or
anything that is beneficial to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I transitioned my lifestyle as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know we always have that kind of
similarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you make a valid point, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll have to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a .org site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has all studies on record dating
back to 1970.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them, of course, being private
and private university because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: position of schedule one for the last
several decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's quite intriguing, to your point,
Israel being the capital of both science
[SPEAKER_02]: and medicine and going over there and
learning at the Cannabis and Cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: University, being myself a cancer
survivor, hearing what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: to your point, Natal, the fact that they
are literally finding cultivar-specific
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions to combating certain cancerous
cells, prostate, colon, and breast being
[SPEAKER_02]: the three cancers that they were targeting
because they're three of the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: killers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But seeing that they're actually,
to your point, being able to eradicate
[SPEAKER_02]: those cells with cannabis blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, if I ever came out of
remission, that's the first place I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to versus the Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's awesome to hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing so much research there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They even did a full factorial study for
insomnia where they tested 600 different
[SPEAKER_06]: combinations of THC, CBD, and CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, that's real science.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me in this industry, that's what gets
me excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's another good transition
to Jack and to be candid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people that know me in this
industry, in this community, I'm all about
[SPEAKER_02]: endorsing not just the brands I believe in
and the products and solution,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the people that are behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a good segue to you,
Jack, in your background and what
[SPEAKER_02]: motivates you to get into it and obviously
how you kind of had that pivot and
[SPEAKER_02]: ideology towards cannabis many years ago
before getting into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe if you could share a bit of your
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And background in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely, Lance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like DOTEL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in a pretty anti-cannabis place
and looked at the people using them like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be like that guy or that
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very negative stereotype,
very anti-intellectual perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it really wasn't until my brother
went out to whoever suffers from severe
[SPEAKER_00]: cerebral palsy went out to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tried medical cannabis for the first
time and got tremendous relief from it
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really got interested in and opened
up my eyes to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was growing in Ohio back when that
was probably worse than dealing heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been growing since before I had a
driver's license and just been around the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, 420 is really about the
patients, the people who truly get,
[SPEAKER_00]: who don't just die, enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or get anxiety relief from it or a little
bit of pain relief from it like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had back surgery or spinal surgery
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly consider myself a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's the people who have had
chronic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life quality has been substantially
improved by our industry and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who sacrifice a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're here being able to talk
about this on the internet and reveal on
[SPEAKER_00]: our faces and talk about the businesses
that we have and the exciting things we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people sacrifice a whole lot for
us to be able to have the privilege to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not all of them have great strains
named after them or are memorialized or
[SPEAKER_00]: have a great legacy in today's industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly not Steve D'Angelo who I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's countless people who weren't just
incarcerated or worked tirelessly by the
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight oil to create and innovate great
products that will bring a lot of help and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of value to people like Rick Simpson
oil or some of these other great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what 420 is to us at
Grove Bags and to me as somebody who got
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in cannabis for those reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's a huge part of my everyday
life now, both professionally and
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we try to focus on for the
holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to hear from Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kevin Stratowski, you brought up a
great perspective and definitely some
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting intellect to the conversation
in the documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the same question for you as well,
a little bit about what 420 means for you
[SPEAKER_02]: and how it impacts you in your current
life and profession.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had kind of a funny entrance into
cannabis by happenstance, which I guess we
[SPEAKER_08]: would call the legacy market now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a friend that for whatever set of
reasons, had some plants that he was
[SPEAKER_08]: worried about keeping in his house for
another set of weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he called me and didn't want all that
work to go to waste and asked me if we
[SPEAKER_08]: could throw him in my basement.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why the hell not?
[SPEAKER_08]: So we threw him in my basement and did a
couple of day crash course on growing back
[SPEAKER_08]: where I think I just watered it and dunked
or toss some super thrive on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, just started to really kind
of, I would say at that point,
[SPEAKER_08]: I got re-interested in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I dabbled a little bit in high school,
but at the time, whatever cannabis I was
[SPEAKER_08]: getting, wasn't really helping me or
affecting me in the way I wanted it to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually gave me a little bit of
anxiety and I didn't really like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, looking back on that,
I think it's because we've progressed so
[SPEAKER_08]: far and now there's other options,
but it kind of reinvigorated my passion
[SPEAKER_08]: for the plant and kind of got me to try a
few more things, you know, try some new
[SPEAKER_08]: material out, you know, gets different
consumption methods, things of that
[SPEAKER_08]: nature, edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really found that for me,
it became this thing mentally that was so
[SPEAKER_08]: important to me because, you know,
a lot of people have body ailments that
[SPEAKER_08]: they use it for different objectives.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had those yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm starting to feel them now at 35,
but I've been good so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for me, it was a mental thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an overactive mind and it really
kind of just allowed me to slow down a
[SPEAKER_08]: bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So fast forward, I ended up starting a CBD
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ran that for a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the time, my friend Nick was
starting a manufacturing company,
[SPEAKER_08]: Precision Extraction Solutions.
[SPEAKER_08]: He asked me to come on board as like the
fifth or sixth employee and kind of built
[SPEAKER_08]: the company from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And fast forward, I started branching out,
getting involved in some retail and some
[SPEAKER_08]: other parts of the industry and just,
I mean, fell in love with it and the
[SPEAKER_08]: people and kind of decided more recently
to go off to some independent consulting
[SPEAKER_08]: and kind of build my own businesses,
which kind of brings me into, I guess,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, what does 420 mean for me
personally?
[SPEAKER_08]: It is my dog's birthday, Mason,
for real birthday, not like somebody
[SPEAKER_08]: filled it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Born on 420, so fittings.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a day going back to the mental
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know Corey mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's a day for me to like relax,
slow down a bit and just really appreciate
[SPEAKER_08]: what's around me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a time to celebrate the plant and
kind of how far we've came in the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell you from a business point,
it's fun because we've been blessed and
[SPEAKER_08]: been able to get three retail locations,
planted provisioning in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have them in Whitmore Lake,
Flint and Bay City.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, it's a time on that side of it
to kind of say thanks to our customers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, Corey mentioned this as well,
but like bring people together,
[SPEAKER_08]: have some fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we do like create, we do
giveaways, vendors, food trucks,
[SPEAKER_08]: promos, we get the radio there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Lance said as well, community and
cannabis and basically bringing them
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you rocked it over precision
extraction, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sweet that you're still consoling for
them, but obviously you killed it over
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great to hear what you're doing as
far as your new ventures and
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a wild ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably an understatement, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Evan, definitely last but not least,
but I want to hear a little bit more from
[SPEAKER_02]: your side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now connected via the documentary,
but I really love some of the things you
[SPEAKER_02]: put in perspective in this documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: About the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So same question goes to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my relationship with cannabis has
been a really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just growing up in the East Coast,
having the kind of used consumption growth
[SPEAKER_05]: or anything always been underground and
something that you just don't talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a lot of things that is a
format of an East Coast culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I moved out to California about 12
years ago in Florida that I had an
[SPEAKER_05]: experience with a friend of mine who would
kind of joke and poke.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one time he made this comment that I
hadn't had my medicine and I didn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually kind of set me off a little
bit more until I moved to California and
[SPEAKER_05]: actually understood what plant medicine
really is and what community really is all
[SPEAKER_05]: about and actually understood what he
meant as a joke was an actual real thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And going to some of the points that were
made I have a very active non-linear way
[SPEAKER_05]: of thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so consuming has always helped me to
slow down my process, slow down my
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking, understanding how to interact
better with people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what happened as a very sort of
friendly poke from a, I don't know if it
[SPEAKER_05]: was friendly at the time, but a poke from
a friend turned out to be something that
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimately I learned very deeply about
over the course of time and my connection
[SPEAKER_05]: to getting involved on the business side
was a little bit fortuitous just as a
[SPEAKER_05]: result of relationships over time and
working in various industries and
[SPEAKER_05]: entertainment media and with celebrities
being some of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And turned out got involved with who some
may call a beacon for the industry in some
[SPEAKER_05]: ways in that Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from there and since about 2012,
2013 have been involved in a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ultimately for me it comes down to
really two aspects and that's hospitality
[SPEAKER_05]: and ultimately caregiving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I learned that very early on in my
life, both my parents are caregivers in
[SPEAKER_05]: different ways, understood the value of
what those connections really mean and
[SPEAKER_05]: getting involved in the business side of
it has somewhat created a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: challenge because there is somewhat of a
conflict between what people see as an
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to make a lot of money and all
that might be true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the intent that I've ever started
out with.
[SPEAKER_05]: My intent has always been to provide some
value or some quality of care or something
[SPEAKER_05]: that I can give to others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ultimately the return of that if done
well is some potential return and that
[SPEAKER_05]: could be financial or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 420 to me has a little bit of a mixed
bag, if you will.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the one hand, it does bring community
together in a way that most other holidays
[SPEAKER_05]: may not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really unique and interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hearing some of the folks on the panel
that do a lot of giveaways and help people
[SPEAKER_05]: who may not have the means to acquire
plant medicine on their own, that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful side of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other side, I see this tendency
towards trying to take as much from a
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those opportunities happen
around 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them happen throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that holiday, if you will,
some people seem to point to as a way to
[SPEAKER_05]: extract extra value from consumers
knowingly or unknowingly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it creates a little bit of a challenge
for me to feel very free and comfortable
[SPEAKER_05]: celebrating that day and more so the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interestingly enough for me and the
business that we're in, it's not just
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really around all plant medicine and
having bicycle day the day before and then
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously 420 on the day after.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just an interesting point to
recognize how important plant medicine
[SPEAKER_05]: community and caregiving really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Psychedelics will be able to play a much
more significant role in our lives as we
[SPEAKER_05]: start to see those plants, those
substances being more widely accepted as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a nice parallel between what
happened with cannabis and what's
[SPEAKER_05]: happening now in the psychedelic movement
and community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, it always comes back down to
developing, at least this point in my
[SPEAKER_05]: career, developing brands that can be the
carrier for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ultimately that is to connect people
more, have people feel more deeply,
[SPEAKER_05]: to heal in whatever way that means,
and ultimately to thrive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis and plant medicine is a way
for me to be able to do that and for me to
[SPEAKER_05]: really share that with others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you having me on this
documentary and also on this webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great having you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you make some excellent points.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remind me of saying, I always say
that, well, alcohol, I've always felt that
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol helps you lose yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis helps you find yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think to your point, psychedelics
fall into that same linear with these
[SPEAKER_02]: neuropaths that otherwise aren't being
used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you make an excellent point too for
people that come out to California,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we forget, even before the
legalization via Prop 215 in 1996,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had Prop P back in 1990, which was only
in the city and county that is San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco, but that's back in the brownie,
Mary and the dentist prune.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make a very valid point because Dennis
was always an advocate for medicinal,
[SPEAKER_02]: never for adult use or recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always led with medicinal at all ages,
all levels because of that potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he really held the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was always 215 over Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very interesting point you make about
how the people are most passionate,
[SPEAKER_02]: have made the biggest movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been for those right reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, for the community and for
the healing first, not for the profit and
[SPEAKER_02]: for the capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capitalism, which in my opinion,
with you should always come second
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawns, I didn't forget about you,
but I did want to ask you because of being
[SPEAKER_02]: an individual that just in recent years,
I mean, I know personally you've known of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant, but you've done several
documentaries prior to this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done, I believe hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually covered aquaponics,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This country is not very apt to
aquaponics, but you've covered it both
[SPEAKER_02]: from urban grow, commercial grow,
and then now kind of covering it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: holistically and across the board on all
aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has it been as you kind of segue more
into the space in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe not so much just on 420,
but as you've covered it from behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: lens, from a very objective perspective,
how has your kind of mindset towards this
[SPEAKER_02]: space changed over the years?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up on a farm in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So agriculture has always been kind of in
my mind, in my background.
[SPEAKER_01]: My last name is Dutch and it means of the
plow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like literally in my DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like farming is just part of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I grew up really, really conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always the joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're so straight edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't even until film school and
college here in Arizona, which is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: place that's at the forefront of any of
these movements, really pushing things
[SPEAKER_01]: forward, but it's not also too far behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always kind of playing catch up in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was around that time that there was
shows like weeds coming out or there were
[SPEAKER_01]: some documentaries that were really like
kind of prominent at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this awareness around this
plant that for my whole life had been
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was through content and media that
I started exploring that just how can a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant be this bad, this dangerous from
like what I grew up with, what everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of told the common knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was content that changed that and
shaped that for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over the years, it's something
that I've always just been fascinated
[SPEAKER_01]: with, like watching things grow,
whether it's a tree in my backyard or
[SPEAKER_01]: growing tomatoes or vegetables or
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another plant to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that through all the
documentaries we've done, all the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've talked to, it's oddly a part of
almost everybody's life, whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: admit it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are still have that,
you know, that shame, that stigma of why I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really want to show this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a part of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there's just this still
this level of misunderstanding around the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and being able to tell some of those
stories on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the first cannabis documentary
we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on a home grow for a caregiver
operation just from a house, a residential
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we premiered that on 420 a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so growing up and in college at 420
was always just like a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, it's 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, more recently, learning kind of
the history of it, I'm just always
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciative of the fact that it's such a
humble beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is what resonates the
most with me, that it's now this kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, worldwide phenomenon from
something just so simple as just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the humble roots of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I always like to use the
analogy of planting seeds in any part of
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You plant seeds and some of them will grow
and some of them won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never really know what you're going to
get at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do your best and you take care
of it and you tend to your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: you tend to your farm, you'll have this
amazing harvest at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to do with content,
planting seeds, because you don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know the person, the one person
might watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that person could, the ripple effects,
right, the butterfly effect is just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't even capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just put out there good content,
good work, good energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put good into the world,
I think it kind of perpetuates more good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's kind of what it's,
it's all kind of shaped up to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like to make these
documentaries on the business of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivation of cannabis but also just
other stuff about making sourdough bread
[SPEAKER_01]: or growing gourmet mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all part of this world where we're
making things, we're doing good,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make the world a better place
for us locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think that ends up spreading
far beyond what we even are able to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider and know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you, you've mentioned sourdough,
but that's one we've talked about on more
[SPEAKER_02]: than one occasion, how much success has
come from that documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now timing might have been a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've always been one in the
kitchen to cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do anything in my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gardening, cooking, fixing hot rods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, the sourdough trend, we took off
during the pandemic and talk about timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that that company is thriving,
but for the right reasons, to your point,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we discussed that, you know,
it was a hundred percent organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: figuratively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, for them to just have
that documentary come out at the right
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now to hear the people from around the
world come and visit this bakery in
[SPEAKER_02]: Arizona that happened to be in this
documentary that you created.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a different category,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you touched on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we, I'm not going to speak for
everyone, but it looks like most of us are
[SPEAKER_02]: Gen Xers right around that range.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the younger end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we grew up with the stigma
associated with the D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_02]: program, Nancy Reagan, which, you know,
D.A.R.E., they started D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_02]: all, I think it was D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_02]: was started out here in Southern
California, anyway, the D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even to your point, like the Boomers
and the whole Nixon era in 71,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you brought up a good point,
Evan, in that, you know, psychedelics and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, they were being studied by the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: government until Nixon started his war on
drugs in 71.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's actual studies on the
books from the government studying these
[SPEAKER_02]: these different substances and before they
obviously weaponized them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is still that stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that so much more prevalent
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still am surprised by going to a trade
show in the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember walking into the facility
and there was a pop up daycare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, Child Protective
Services would be all over this if this
[SPEAKER_02]: was back in the States here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being grown ups about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being professional and taking this
serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, hey, we have a career.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have children that need to be
tended to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really interesting how that
stigma, like you said, as much as we feel
[SPEAKER_02]: it's being better suppressed than before,
it still exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so thanks for being able to tell
the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I feel like you really tell
from an objective perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, I think, that much more valued
and appreciated by the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've talked enough about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if, Adam, if you possibly
have, I guess it would be a trailer if you
[SPEAKER_02]: would queued up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's show this really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super stoked about this game.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis has been around for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The stoner stereotype still persists to
this day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because we're cannabis operators,
we're not criminals and we never have
[SPEAKER_04]: been.
[SPEAKER_04]: About three quarters of the population in
this country feel that it should be legal
[SPEAKER_04]: at some level.
[SPEAKER_08]: In some states, it's the number one cash
crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Businesses coming out of thin air to
service the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our goal is to sophisticated the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are currently building that technology
that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't realize that this is
a challenging industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's akin to dancing a kite in a
hurricane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it shocks people how sophisticated
these companies are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the challenge of really
helping to change people's minds around
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's akin to dancing with a kite in a
hurricane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that quote, Jack, because that's
one thing we all talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just on the phone with individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been in the industry for several
years, been a part of the community and is
[SPEAKER_02]: not as much in touch with it as she has
been over the last decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, yeah, a lot of crazy stuff
is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's tough times for many aspects
of the community domestically here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: States, but specifically for our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of a reset that we're
going through again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you made a pretty interesting
metaphor there, Jack, in reference to
[SPEAKER_02]: where things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to kind of talk about a few of the
touch points that you all spoke on,
[SPEAKER_02]: starting off with that one, Jack,
where do you feel like things are as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as current state?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it feels like it's tougher forever
for us, but things are still moving in the
[SPEAKER_02]: right direction as far as cannabis goes,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, there's some
encouraging signs that we'll have a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little rebound recovery and
stabilization this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, things have been extremely
challenging, particularly California,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada and Michigan, Massachusetts,
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program got so messy that they
actually voted against recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, which I think was a big shock
in a moment for a lot of us to stop and
[SPEAKER_00]: take positive market and where the markets
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, I mean, the
international market is booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the same proportion of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: population that has access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same portion of the global
population soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very excited by what's happening
in South Africa and Thailand and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, Australia really, especially in
Europe, all over the world, in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany announcing that they're going
towards more of a homegrown method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see how that plays
out, but that excites me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's empowering the patients and trying
to empower the local cannabis economy and
[SPEAKER_00]: the local cannabis ecosystem and culture
within there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're really at the nascent
stage of the gold market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I say we're dancing a
kite in a hurricane because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly changing commoditized pricing
coming into play in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people have been arguing for
years, what kind of industry is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we a farmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we this or that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said for a couple of years,
I'll tell you what kind of industry we
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: 95, 97 percent of this is commoditized
agribusiness and CPG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a fight to get out of that
and to stay out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still believe, you know,
walking around Benzinga last week,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, two thirds of the
companies I saw at least won't be around
[SPEAKER_00]: in three or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that about some pretty big ones
that are notorious and have raised a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the situation is still
so fluid and the industry is so fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many regulations like
banking and everything else that are still
[SPEAKER_00]: moving under our feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we're in a fluid
business and rapidly growing, rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: changing, rapidly maturing in a tree and a
very overregulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an interesting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there are things to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't I don't I question how many
California brands will be surviving right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moving through the back door and
coming back from the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make a very valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are we as an industry going to
talk about brand equity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, does anybody actually give that
much of a shit about a brand or do they
[SPEAKER_00]: just want a great experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like you said, some of those
brands, those backdoor deals, I surprised
[SPEAKER_02]: to see what I thought was was knockoffs of
California brands on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world in Thailand, only to find out those
really were the brands and the product
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to your point, it's this whole global
movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree, kind of like education in
this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're behind that international stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen more cannabis than most
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a true world class exotic,
you know, and I recognize product from
[SPEAKER_00]: certain rooms in other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say that I haven't been in
Thailand and seen some of the best rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in the world there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, a lot of these other
markets, I don't think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's true anymore that if it's not grown
in Northern California, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's at the very best step below,
step below that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's true anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I mean, we're in an intense
global market where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are fighting to establish brands
and flowers moving all over the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be Barcelona or Thailand or
cannabis clubs on the Canary Islands,
[SPEAKER_00]: of which there are 700.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot going on in the
international scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned Germany, which Germany
has been leading, but we know also,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously, the Czech Republic,
Czechia is moving pretty rapidly as is
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like you said, you know,
Europe with, gosh, double the populace of
[SPEAKER_02]: North America, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 734 million plus people in the EU alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big consumer base that already is
consuming today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one thing that's
covered in the documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's already the consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's already the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just creating that infrastructure,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it definitely shifted quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think kind of tied into that,
too, you know, Evan, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the quotes that actually was in the
quick trailer was touching on the stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much do you think the stigma has
played into where the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: stands versus some of these other
countries that have made a total 180,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, from capital punishment to
completely legal in a country like
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand, which we would have never
fathomed five, 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is that playing a role in where
we are positioned as a global leader or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe not when it comes to cannabis in the
legal state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominant market, dominant IP, dominant
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought leadership, I would still say,
is very heavily the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's it continues to become a
global and international movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, Canada certainly
faltered a substantial, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what seemed an insurmountable head
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think many of the world's great
cannabis companies probably have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: started yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the stereotype has been
somewhat broken down, but still not fully
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a lot of people who have been
able to share their stories more freely in
[SPEAKER_05]: the last 10 years, at least in the U.S.,
not not speaking internationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's made it easier for more NASA
scientists to enter this space and others
[SPEAKER_05]: who who might feel a perceived risk if
they come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I experienced that myself in the
early days where, you know, I had
[SPEAKER_05]: challenges because I was actively involved
and very vocally involved in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's unfortunate, but it is where we
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that stigma is what's
holding us back as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: As our ingrained stubbornness as a society
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: to think that we're right about
everything, in fact, when we're generally
[SPEAKER_05]: not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the whole war on drugs came from
us and sort of reverting back from that is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be really difficult in many ways,
at least if we're thinking about a
[SPEAKER_05]: functional democratic society.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sometimes we can question
whether we are that or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely created some barriers,
but I don't think that's ultimately the
[SPEAKER_05]: reason why we still have those issues
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a politician.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't ever want to be a politician,
but yet I know everything is political,
[SPEAKER_05]: which means that everything is sort of
driven by a profit motive, especially in
[SPEAKER_05]: this country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really where I think a lot of
the you know, the headwinds are still,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we can talk about religion and
other issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those two have various aspects of of a
headwind for the community and the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's more of a profit
motivation or lack thereof to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: solve societal issues using plant medicine
and using our ability to heal one another
[SPEAKER_05]: is why we're still in the position we are
domestically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Internationally, I'm not as familiar with
how other countries are fully embracing
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant, but certainly it's at a federal
level, which makes it a lot easier to move
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those political processes are far
different than what we've been
[SPEAKER_05]: experiencing here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some especially Commonwealth
countries, I find, you know, because take
[SPEAKER_02]: like Australia, for example, which is
essentially if England in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: had a child, that's how I kind of see the
way that they function, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They love barbecues and big V8 engines,
but they also do still have their tea at
[SPEAKER_02]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I see them very much to your point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fully embraced our war on drugs to
the point of where they're doing swab
[SPEAKER_02]: testing on roadsides.
[SPEAKER_02]: After events out there, which I've been a
part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy to think that they still
have that mentality of this being that
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule one, because myself being of all
things a criminal justice major in
[SPEAKER_02]: college, I'm kind of like, you know,
how Natal was like something was amiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw why cannabis fit in schedule
one, along with cocaine and other
[SPEAKER_02]: substances and just never actually asked
cocaine to PCP and methamphetamines never
[SPEAKER_02]: quite made sense to me on how it was
classified.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll be in a brand holder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know we're kind of a little over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Katie, how does you know, as far as
where you are and what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're offering, what is the one
thing that you continue to lead with in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to move forward in the current state
of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is it conversation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so we we decided to to take two
really taboo industries and combine them
[SPEAKER_09]: into one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have not only sexual health and
wellness, but then cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for us, it's been there's just so many
hurdles to jump through just in terms of
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, in the documentary, it says,
like, just simple advertising,
[SPEAKER_09]: like we can't do Instagram, we can't do
Google ads, we can't, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's it's really very, very challenging.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think building a community is
kind of the key.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's something that we're actively
building is a is a positive sexual health,
[SPEAKER_09]: health and wellness community.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard in terms of even just the
the regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we ordered packaging.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the time we ordered packaging,
they had changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the packaging that we ordered,
we could no longer use and had to order
[SPEAKER_09]: new packaging, which is, which is kind of
all part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think all of us have had something like
that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the moving target for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know we're getting close on time,
but want to circle back to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this has been again,
it was a really different angle that was
[SPEAKER_02]: taken with this documentary is a little
bit more of the reality, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The real side of things that you said you
covered different aspects, but as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to and I think was mentioned some of the
early document, one of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: documentaries I was tied to the industry
was was rolling papers, which was one that
[SPEAKER_02]: we do with the cannabis out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was more about the buzz and the
energy and the hoopla and all the money
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one took a little bit more of a
surreal look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the follow up is?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if there was to be another one
in a year, what would that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think compared to to what we
covered here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly to talk more about the
international and global stage as it
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to how everything's becoming
connected now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I intentionally wanted to focus on
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: for this one, but I think there's more
stories to be told there as well as just
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the interesting stories of the
people who were kind of risking it all
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things when it was much more highly
punished than it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is another area that's,
you know, you can never tell enough of
[SPEAKER_01]: those stories, I think, because those are
the people who, you know, deserve a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: credit for what they did, the risk they
took and the sacrifices they made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's always more stories to
tell because it occurred to me as Evan was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking, you know, the war on drugs is
often framed as a failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we failed with the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very rare, if not ever,
that I've heard it framed as it was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost as if it would have like,
oh, well, if it had been a success,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would have been, you know, it would
have been worth it if we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Win the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think moving forward, I think a lot
of that, the damage that has been done
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be framed as like, this was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, this was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to kind of come to terms with
that, I think, as a society and a culture
[SPEAKER_01]: for however many, you know, everyone who
kind of bought into that belief that all
[SPEAKER_01]: these people are evil and criminals and we
need to punish them and kind of like make
[SPEAKER_01]: amends for all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot more stories that
could be told there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you made a very valid point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know until more recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I knew all the way back to the
Anslinger days, but I didn't know it was
[SPEAKER_02]: Napoleon and it was the French that
actually started the true war on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That blew my mind when I went that far
back into the history books and learned
[SPEAKER_02]: about that's where it really started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to your point, I hear it as well,
the failed war on drugs versus the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that the war on specifically this drug
should have never happened because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: weaponized to target minorities,
obviously during the Anslinger era,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also during the Nixon era and to a
certain extent, I believe the Dare era as
[SPEAKER_02]: well with the modern day war on drugs that
we all grew up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, really appreciate the
storytelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all of you for being a part
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think it was such a props to
Strawns for such a diverse group of
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals with so many different
backgrounds and so many different
[SPEAKER_02]: motivations that tie to what makes you
passionate about what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's one thing that,
again, I really applaud an individual
[SPEAKER_02]: that's coming from the outside in and
being able to tap people that put passion
[SPEAKER_02]: and community first and industry and
profit second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's as much as we'd like to
thank everyone in this community is good
[SPEAKER_02]: vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know there are players who are just out
for that extreme capitalism that haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: touched on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely appreciate all of you taking
the apartment and looking forward for the
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary to debut and for people to
find out the true story, not the Hollywood
[SPEAKER_02]: story, but the true story of what the
current state is for our community and our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you all again for coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a fantastic 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that are tuning in, I definitely
appreciate all of you joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it took a little different
angle doing more of a kind of a nod to the
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 into this documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you all for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be doing another webinar next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely be sure to join in with us
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all and have a good rest of your
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next time.
Thank you.
