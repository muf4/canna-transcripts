[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Cali High Episode 65,
The Gardu Nord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Cenzo Nico, also known as
Vince Nicoletti, and this is the fifth
[SPEAKER_00]: episode in a new series called,
A Work in Progress, A Retrospective of
[SPEAKER_00]: Adventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gardu Nord is a cautionary traveler's
tale, which begins in a rainstorm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Studio City, and takes us through Paris,
Tunis, and Amsterdam, and ends on a
[SPEAKER_00]: Eurostar train bound for Florence,
Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gardu Nord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met my present wife walking in Studio
City during a torrential rainstorm in
[SPEAKER_00]: December 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had woken up to the rain pounding
outside, and it was December, and I was on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought to myself, if I never get out of
the house, I'm never gonna meet anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had broken up with my last girlfriend of
five years, six months earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went back to bed and slept another
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I woke up again, the rain was
pouring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dressed, had some coffee,
rolled a reefer, and grabbed my coat and
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Venturing forth from the apartment,
I went down by the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: River Aqueduct, commonly referred to as
The Wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water was four feet from the top and
moving at a good 30 mile per hour clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lit the reefer, took a hit, and after
observing the water passing by,
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed Coldwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walking behind the sportsman's lodge along
The Wash, I came up on the edge of an
[SPEAKER_00]: office building parking lot next to the
Pins Bowling Alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two girls were trying to get from their
car to the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing my umbrella, I helped them get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossing the boulevard, I went into the
Native American Art Store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some beautifully crafted silver
and turquoise jewelry on display,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I later came back to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heading west along the south side of
Ventura Boulevard, I ended up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: southwest corner of Coldwater and Ventura.
[SPEAKER_00]: A young lady was standing waiting to cross
the boulevard.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had no umbrella, was dressed in jeans,
and had a waist-length windbreaker-type
[SPEAKER_00]: raincoat with the hood pulled over her
hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light turned green and I stepped off
the sidewalk into the crosswalk,
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella in hand, wearing my stepfather's
old leader hose and button-up gray wool
[SPEAKER_00]: coat that he got in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many after World War II, he was a retired
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Army colonel and the coat was iconic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow I inherited it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Halfway through crossing the street,
I made up my mind to stop and wait for the
[SPEAKER_00]: girl, who had fallen somewhat behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She caught up with me on the corner in
front of Twain's, and I turned and asked
[SPEAKER_00]: her, would you like to share my umbrella?
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, thanks, this reminds me of my
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started walking down Coldwater under my
umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked into her eyes for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were captivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her face was wreathed with the hood of her
jacket pulled tight around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunisia, she replied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew where it was and I knew the name of
the capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you from Tunis?
[SPEAKER_00]: She was surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, she glanced at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rain was torrential.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we walked, I asked her if she liked
Algerian rhyme music.
[SPEAKER_00]: This got her attention as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some white guy in Ventura who knew of
North African culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about some of our favorite
Algerian singers, Cheb Khaled and Cheb
[SPEAKER_00]: Mami and others and kept walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to where she was going,
a duplex on Moorpark Street, and the rain
[SPEAKER_00]: had never let up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked her to take my number and she
wrote it with a lipstick liner pen on a
[SPEAKER_00]: strip from a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: After she went in, I folded my umbrella
and went skipping through puddles with the
[SPEAKER_00]: rain still falling back to my apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The umbrella itself had a note I had
written years earlier on the name tag
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the clear plastic handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It read, this is a magic umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to use it, you may turn into a
frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: By early the next year, we were married
and by 2006, it was time to go to Tunisia
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet the in-laws and have a traditional
Tunisian marriage and explore Tunisia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plan was to fly Air France into Paris,
hang out with my wife's Parisian relatives
[SPEAKER_00]: and then fly to Tunis.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Tunisia, Italy would be our major
destination and we were anxious to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: some time there after having studied a few
semesters of Italian with Giovanni
[SPEAKER_00]: Trombetta at LA Valley College.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flew Air France from Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife's Uncle Fateh and her aunt's
boyfriend Ali met us at the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had so many bags of luggage that we
needed two cars to move ourselves and our
[SPEAKER_00]: luggage from the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of an argument ensued over who was
going to put which bags in which car and
[SPEAKER_00]: who would ride with whom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up with Ali and my wife rode with
her Uncle Fateh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got such a tiny room near the Eiffel
Tower that our luggage filled up the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire walking space in the room and only
the bed, balcony and bathroom were free
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces we could stand or sit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paris was and is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Eiffel Tower, an amazing feet of steel
architecture built in 1889 along the banks
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Seine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arc de Triomphe built in 1836 to honor
the armies of the Revolution and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where you can learn to drive in a
chaotic turnstile which I had mastered
[SPEAKER_00]: years earlier on my bicycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Champs-Elysees, one of the 12 avenues
that lead right to the Arc de Triomphe and
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can find a groovy cafe to grab a
bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also the Buddha Bar,
a hip restaurant club in the basement of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ritz Hotel where a cool DJ was
spinning world beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cannot forget the Louvre, a great
museum with a glass pyramid we've all seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in movies and the lesser known Bois de
Boulogne, a large park to ride your bike
[SPEAKER_00]: through and do other nefarious things in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the River Seine which snakes
around Paris with bridges covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: ornate statuary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out a few days partying with my
wife's uncles, aunts and cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her aunt Monia's boyfriend Ali drove a
Mercedes limo and chauffeured us around
[SPEAKER_00]: the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few days we left Paris for Tunis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a rocking wedding party on the roof
of my father-in-law's house including the
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest Tunisian band with an amazing
singer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to know my three very cool
brothers-in-law and we hung out in La
[SPEAKER_00]: Marse, a happening beach town just north
of Tunis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We explored the country guided by
Mohandas, my father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We visited the North Coast along the
Mediterranean, went up into the Atlas
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountains, toured an ancient Roman town
with subterranean houses, beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: tiled and masterfully built, all the while
eating Tunisian cuisine wherever we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was time to leave Tunisia,
we flew back to Paris to take the train to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and from there we would hop back
on the train south to Italy, transiting
[SPEAKER_00]: through Paris once more.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the whole Tunisian story deserves
its own chapter and will be told in a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we landed back in Paris, Ali picked
us up at the airport and drove us to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gare du Nord, Paris' northern train
station.
[SPEAKER_00]: He warned me not to bring anything back
from Amsterdam as we were driving to the
[SPEAKER_00]: train station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully declined to mention my
plans to take some stash to Italy so as
[SPEAKER_00]: not to worry anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ali dropped us at the station and from
there we took the TGV, France's sleek
[SPEAKER_00]: high-speed train, to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would come back to the station on the
way to Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gare du Nord was built in 1846.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main hall terminus has a gently
sloping A-frame ceiling covering the
[SPEAKER_00]: trains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi-circular windows line the sides and
ornate iron pillars hold up the main beams
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the train pulls out of the station,
the tracks take you through the backside
[SPEAKER_00]: of old Paris neighborhoods north of the
station, lined with old brick buildings
[SPEAKER_00]: and their sit-covered chimneys,
eventually giving way to suburbs and then
[SPEAKER_00]: farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once out of the city, the train
accelerated to 200 miles per hour and the
[SPEAKER_00]: near scenery raced by in a blur as the
distant countryside passed by a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: slower, but still at a good clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We arrived in Amsterdam and took the
subway into town from the train station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, for those who have never been
there, is an adult Disneyland of sorts and
[SPEAKER_00]: having been there before, I decided three
days would be more than enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We checked into the Hotel Amerikan,
which is now called the Hard Rock American
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotel, located off the center square of
the Leeds Spleen, right across from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulldog Cafe, Amsterdam's most famous
coffee shop or dispensary as we call them
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is that in Amsterdam it's a
coffee shop where you can drink coffee and
[SPEAKER_00]: other non-alcoholic beverages,
buy cannabis products, and smoke them
[SPEAKER_00]: right there in the coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oddity about the Bulldog Cafe,
however, is that upstairs from the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement coffee cannabis shop is the
Bulldog Bar, where tourists coiff fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: Heineken's on tap in large mugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the coffee shop part, people were
smoking cannabis and were so stoned from
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging in the smoking room that they
weren't talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggae was playing and no one was engaged
in any interaction or conversation unless
[SPEAKER_00]: it was asking the bartender for more
coffee or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, walk outside and upstairs to the
bar and the conversations were so loud
[SPEAKER_00]: above the music you could hardly hear
yourself think.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our stay, my wife and I walked
around the back streets and along the
[SPEAKER_00]: canals exploring Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a great coffee shop called
Danskrieg and later I returned and
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased hashish of a few varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite was made from the white widow
strain, super tasty and strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it reminded me of the old Afghan primo
brought in by the Brotherhood of Eternal
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to Laguna Beach back in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought an ounce in total and met my wife
back at the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later we decided to get something to eat
and down a side street we found a Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in and ordered some food,
but when I started speaking Thai to the
[SPEAKER_00]: waitress, who appeared to be Thai,
she didn't understand one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, none of the Asians
running the place spoke Thai at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now the jig was up and I figured they
were Filipinos masquerading as Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as one might imagine, the food tasted
nothing like Thai food even though it had
[SPEAKER_00]: a vaguely familiar look about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we only stayed three days and
some of the most memorable moments were
[SPEAKER_00]: walking in Vondel Park and hanging out in
pubs by the canals drinking large flagons
[SPEAKER_00]: of fresh Heineken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We missed the Van Gogh Museum with the
promise to ourselves to visit next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We boarded the train for Paris and
Amsterdam where upon arrival we would take
[SPEAKER_00]: a taxi from the Gare du Nord to the Gare
Lyon and hop on a southern bound train to
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fields of multicolored tulips passed by as
the train sped south.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stopped in Brussels, Belgium for about
a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: While waiting at the Brussels South
railway station, we got out and I took a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hits of a reefer I had while standing
at the end of a platform behind a little
[SPEAKER_00]: hut a little way away from my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few minutes, a voice from the
overhead speaker rang out, now departing
[SPEAKER_00]: for Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got back on the train and sat back
in our seats once again watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: pastoral countryside speed by.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going straight on to Florence or
Ferenze as it is called in Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we would begin our stay up in the
hills above Florence in Fiesole at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pensione Bencista, a converted villa
across the street from Leonardo da Vinci's
[SPEAKER_00]: house built in the 1400s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bencista serves incomparable wine from
its own vineyard and cooks up wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-course communal dinners every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about trains in Paris is that
there are six train stations that send
[SPEAKER_00]: travelers in different directions
depending upon the desired destinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from Amsterdam by way of Brussels,
we would arrive in Paris back at the Gare
[SPEAKER_00]: du Nord and would need to take a taxi
across Paris to the Gare Lyon and board a
[SPEAKER_00]: Eurostar train south to Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the train stations in Paris were
built over a hundred years ago and are
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful architectural feats in
themselves with high arched ceilings over
[SPEAKER_00]: the platforms under which sleek modern
trains in all colors pull in and await the
[SPEAKER_00]: change of riders and direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of people are hurrying this way
and that to get on board or to leave the
[SPEAKER_00]: station.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gare du Nord is the busiest train
station in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little background here is in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since my wife had not been home in years
when we went to Tunisia we were carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: presents mostly clothes for a host of
family members and so we had giant
[SPEAKER_00]: suitcases which we had purchased in
downtown LA full of clothes for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of us had two as well as a smaller
bag apiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the suitcases were full of items
acquired in Tunisia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful clothes clothing, souvenirs and
all sorts of special herbs for my
[SPEAKER_00]: mother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had my backpack with our passports
and my hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hauled our bags off the train and
started walking down the platform into the
[SPEAKER_00]: station.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was walking faster than I and she
had gotten ahead of me by about 40 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: and was about two steps behind another
female with large bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemingly from out of nowhere French
plainclothes police surrounded them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A woman cop stopped in front of my wife
and said, the French command for stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife speaks French and I could hear her
speaking to the woman cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other girl who was in front of my wife
had been stopped also and was being
[SPEAKER_00]: questioned by another cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took this in as I strode to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some small voice in my head said,
you've got to stop as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously another voice said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops were directing the girls to put
down their bags and open them but I had
[SPEAKER_00]: the keys with our passports and my hashish
in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was putting the bags flat on the
station floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plainclothes squad consisted of two
women, four men and dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragging my suitcases with a bit of
apprehension and dread, I walked up and
[SPEAKER_00]: asked what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The man in charge of the operation,
and we'll just call him Inspector
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouseau, asked me in a thick French
accent, who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm her husband, I said pointing to my
wife, who by this time was standing next
[SPEAKER_00]: to me asking for the keys to the locks on
the suitcase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspector Clouseau, a dark-haired
middle-aged cop, looking and sounding
[SPEAKER_00]: typically French, asked for our passports.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time the dog had begun sniffing
through the girl's luggage who had been in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took off my backpack and put it on the
ground, unzipped it, grabbed the keys to
[SPEAKER_00]: the locks and the passports and left it
right up and right there on the floor of
[SPEAKER_00]: the train station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time seemed to slow down and I slowed down
to match its pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: The words of Miyamoto Musashi,
Japan's greatest swordsman, came into my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: From his book of five rings, I remembered
the section on rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reads, First of all, learn the rhythm
which is appropriate and differentiate it
[SPEAKER_00]: from the rhythms which are inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mastery of the way cannot be
considered firm unless you can avoid being
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn into the rhythm of the opponent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Victory is achieved in the way of conflict
by ascertaining the rhythm of each
[SPEAKER_00]: opponent and by attacking with the rhythm
not anticipated by the opponent and by use
[SPEAKER_00]: of rhythm in the abstract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouseau was my opponent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people passing all around us
and the train announcements were now
[SPEAKER_00]: adding a surreal element to the situation
as they blared in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We unlocked our suitcases as directed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspector Clouseau, the man clearly in
charge, had taken a particular interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: He had our passports.
[SPEAKER_00]: The passports and clearly knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you smoke cannabis in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was becoming a public interrogation at
the Garde Nord.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was playing a game with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: People began to slow as they passed,
gawking at the spectacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't everyone, I ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: He snapped at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ask if everyone smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked if you smoked cannabis in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time, my wife was being asked if
she had any cannabis in the bags by the
[SPEAKER_00]: woman cop who was now speaking English to
her after having seen our passports.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right then, Inspector Clouseau turns
from me and asks my wife a few feet away,
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he bring any cannabis from Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: She looked at me and asked, Did you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't, I replied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an I love Lucy moment and my wife
was about to win an Emmy for this
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked back at Inspector Clouseau and
realized he thought he had apprehended
[SPEAKER_00]: couriers when he saw two unaccompanied
women with large suitcases and that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of the scheme, but we turned
out to have American passports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow that didn't fit the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog was sniffing our suitcases with
little interest, but my backpack was on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground a few feet away with the
hashish and double zip sandwich bags
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog sniffed and the inspector shifted
his way to look at his female colleague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clouseau walked away to confer with the
woman inspector.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked quietly off to the side for
what seemed to be an interminable length
[SPEAKER_00]: of time, which was in fact no more than 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow I was reminded of Edgar Allan
Poe's The Telltale Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standing with my wife, we talked about
schedules and taking a taxi and going to
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy and when we were going to be cut
loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inspector broke up the conversation
with his colleague eventually and walked
[SPEAKER_00]: over and had me our passports and said,
you are free to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to make an exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the passports in my backpack and we
zipped the suitcases and locked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tossed the keys to the suitcase
locks in there, zipped it shut and hoisted
[SPEAKER_00]: it on my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashish intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grabbing our luggage handles, we made our
best nonchalant departure from the Gare du
[SPEAKER_00]: Nord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walking out, we hailed a taxi to take us
across Paris to the Gare Lyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the taxi pulled away from the Gare du
Nord, we glanced back to see if anyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: How silly I would later think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We arrived at the Gare Lyon without
incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gare Lyon is another architectural
wonder with a large clock tower in one
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We boarded the Eurostar for Florence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And felt a sense of release as a train
began to move, gradually speeding south
[SPEAKER_00]: from Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the late afternoon, the train headed up
into beautiful alpine valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Alps rose on both sides and the sun
went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We upgraded to a berth and slept as the
train passed through Switzerland on the
[SPEAKER_00]: way to Milano and then on to Firenze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Cali High episode
