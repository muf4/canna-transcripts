[SPEAKER_02]: Hello fellow growers, this is Chad
Westport and today we're gonna pop some
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds or get some beans sowed or as the
scientists guys would say We're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to show you probably the most
common ways that people are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate their seeds Today we are going
to do some rock wool cubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to do direct sow Into some
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to do the paper towel method
and the paper towel method can be done a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple ways You could put it between two
paper plates or you could put it in some
[SPEAKER_02]: ziplock bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll do both of those Over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got just some jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna fill those with our pH water I
pH it to 6.5 That might not be important
[SPEAKER_02]: to everybody to me it is so pH 6.5 water
to pop my seeds and over here I got a
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of seeds For genetics the new ones
I have right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an Afghani times the Dutch tree
I've got the Afghani back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the new ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the ones I expect a really high
germination rate from I'm also testing
[SPEAKER_02]: some of my older gear I've got a harlequin
times secret sauce and secret sauce isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my secret sauce I've got a
northern lights number five times go time
[SPEAKER_02]: which was from jinx proof genetics I've
also got a Jax cleaner 2 which was from
[SPEAKER_02]: TGA genetics times that to my secret sauce
and then I got a really big bag here of
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay secret sauce times the agent Jack
that's the one I've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: Agent Jack is a f1 cross of TGA's agent
orange and Jack's cleaner 2 so I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: see what germination rate I get from those
First I'm going to show you the water
[SPEAKER_02]: soaking method before we do that though I
want to stress the importance of accurate
[SPEAKER_02]: labeling I've got all of my little
containers labeled A B C D through F.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got them all written down here
Corresponding what the strains are the
[SPEAKER_02]: year that they were made That way I know
what is what later and that is so
[SPEAKER_02]: important when you're testing because you
don't want to get these things confused
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey the simple method of cracking them
in water the soaking method.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just gonna take your container
Gonna fill it with a little bit of pH
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need it super deep You know I'm
filling this maybe halfway, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna do that You're gonna take
your seeds Gonna grab a pinch here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just gonna drop them in one two
three four five six seven And as you see
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are floating around They're in the
center, and we'll see if they sink and
[SPEAKER_02]: open so let's go ahead and do that to all
of the other seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go everything is soaking now
And we're just gonna let that overnight to
[SPEAKER_02]: see if they keep floating or if they sink
And when they sink hopefully they open up
[SPEAKER_02]: and they sprout a tail That's how you
germinate seeds just in water the soak
[SPEAKER_02]: method Now I'm going to show you the Brock
wool method before I do that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to show you something simple
again I've gone ahead and I've labeled
[SPEAKER_02]: everything Everything needs to be labeled
and I've poked my own holes through The
[SPEAKER_02]: rock wool pretty simple two holes each
side gives me two tests on the beans in
[SPEAKER_02]: the rock wool So I got my pH water It's
gonna give them a nice soak
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to get them too soaked you
still want there to be some air in there
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is this is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could kind of squeeze it you get a
feel for how saturated they are that way
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, perfect perfect happy combination,
so again Yeah, I'm just gonna take my
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna start plugging them away in
there And I want to say before we put the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds in here the seeds have a side with a
dimple It's usually the fatter bottom part
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the side where it kind of comes
to the point That's usually the skinnier
[SPEAKER_02]: part now when you're putting them into the
rock wool or soil Just like this you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to put them with the skinny part down so
dimple up That is going to help it come up
[SPEAKER_02]: and grow out of the medium I'm just gonna
touch It right down in there, and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: actually gonna give it just a gentle
little tap down into the rock wool with my
[SPEAKER_02]: skewer and now repeat
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm only shoving them down maybe an
eighth of an inch not deep at all
[SPEAKER_02]: and There you go that is how to put seeds
into rock wool for germination Now let's
[SPEAKER_02]: do directly into the soil I've got it
Split up and marked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it labeled up here as far as what
we're doing again You want to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: you keep track of what is where so you
know what kind of results you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm just gonna gently water this a
little bit with my pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pH to 6.5 water again I don't want to
soak it because the seeds gonna need some
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen But I want it wet enough to correct
that hole okay, so that's probably good,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm gonna do two seeds per Quadrant
here, so I'm just gonna poke a little hole
[SPEAKER_02]: poke a little hole And that is Quadrant F,
okay Make sure I get the right ones in
[SPEAKER_02]: there And again when you put the seed
directly into the soil you want that side
[SPEAKER_02]: with the dimple you want that side Facing
up so the sharp pointy side you want down
[SPEAKER_02]: into the soil General rule of thumb is
you're gonna plant the seed Twice of its
[SPEAKER_02]: width so if you have a seed that's
basically a sixteenth inch wide You're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to bury it an eighth of an inch deep
so not very deep especially for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis seeds Put it in there like so
Take this one put it in there like so I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: just gonna tap it in Oops that one flipped
around on me again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure I get it the right way
down
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bugger Okay, then I'm just gonna
kind of gently give it a little hug with
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil I'm not gonna bury it deep again,
but I Do you want contact with the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little something over it okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that side and I'm basically just
going to repeat
[SPEAKER_02]: and There you go that is popping seeds in
soil for the paper plate method all you're
[SPEAKER_02]: basically doing is putting the seeds in
the paper towel and then covering it up
[SPEAKER_02]: with the paper plate to create sort of a
Humidity dome if you will I've already got
[SPEAKER_02]: these already laid out and as you can see
they're labeled You can see the seeds on
[SPEAKER_02]: the back and let me show you how to do
this basically You just want to take your
[SPEAKER_02]: paper towel your pH water Get it soaked
ring it out a little bit Unfold it onto
[SPEAKER_02]: your plate This is always the hard part
Getting it separated Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: there we go Separated there You take your
seeds you put them in there and they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need to face any special direction because
you're just gonna fold this over Kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: tuck them in get them nice make sure they
have contact fold it over again stay nice
[SPEAKER_02]: and wet
[SPEAKER_02]: Take this put it over there There you go
you got the paper plate method for popping
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds We'll finish up here with the paper
towel method which again is very similar
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Paper plate method you're
essentially getting your paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting a little bit of that pH
water on it Let it soak in Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: now the hard part of separating your paper
towel when it's wet oh I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then roll that there Okay,
so I've got that done I'm gonna take my
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and again, they don't need to go in
any specific direction Some people will
[SPEAKER_02]: actually take the ziplock bags and hang
them upside down because the root will
[SPEAKER_02]: grow down they are in touch with gravity
Gravitropism I believe it is some fancy
[SPEAKER_02]: word, but yeah, the roots will want to
grow down but if you lay Horizontally not
[SPEAKER_02]: a big deal for this portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take my wet paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the seeds in there They got a
nice little hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's contact there take that slide
that into my ziplock bag Try to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: everything nice and separated and I don't
actually seal it but I do kind of keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: clean Close because as you can see on the
one I did earlier There's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture and condensation building up
around it and that will keep them kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: moist My room temperature right now is
about 70 degrees I do not need to use a
[SPEAKER_02]: heat mat if you do use a heat mat if it
was the winter I would if you use a heat
[SPEAKER_02]: mat don't put these directly on the heat
mat because it's gonna dry out the paper
[SPEAKER_02]: towel It's gonna be a little bit too hot
for that fresh seed So just raise it or
[SPEAKER_02]: elevate it a little bit off of the heat
mat And I always recommend that even if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing clones, so that's just good
practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep these in a dark area
Lights not necessarily gonna hurt the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: but light and water that can lead to algae
The molds that can hurt the fresh seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just keep them somewhere
relatively dark relatively warm We'll
[SPEAKER_02]: leave it like that and we'll check in with
them soon Okay, here we are 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: Later, I'm looking at all of the seeds and
all of the seeds have sunk to the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the jars So that's a good sign
Hopefully next thing is they will be
[SPEAKER_01]: opening up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the three seeds here in the
water have cracked They've opened up and
[SPEAKER_02]: the tail is starting to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are ready to be placed into the soil
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead and put
[SPEAKER_02]: one of these seeds into the soil for you
And I have tweezers to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to use tweezers,
but I like to use them, especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: getting them out of the water just makes
it easier for me So I'm just gonna reach
[SPEAKER_02]: into here Get my seed and again,
you want to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to pinch it on the white
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white part is Sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the tail the taproot and you want
to put that down into the soil And another
[SPEAKER_02]: thing I like to do when starting a seed in
soil is here's the top of my pot I have it
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of carved out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna put the seed down here In the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna bury it too deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually only gonna bury it Maybe an
eighth of an inch but what this allows the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed to do is it allows it to get leggy
and spread up and then you can backfill
[SPEAKER_02]: giving it more support because sometimes
seeds they stretch up This is a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: give them support in the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna put it here Again, I'm gonna get
the point down Let's put a little soil
[SPEAKER_02]: over it and there you go it's in the soil
Looking here at the seeds that we put in
[SPEAKER_02]: the paper towels two of these three have
already opened up their tails are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out and I'm gonna take them out of the
paper towel so that the roots don't grow
[SPEAKER_01]: into it and Get damaged when you transfer
I'm gonna take them out right now and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna put them into my soil And then I'm
gonna tuck it back in and let that other
[SPEAKER_02]: seed stay in here and pop for another day
We're five days into it now after we put
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds into either our soil our
rockwool our water or our Paper towels and
[SPEAKER_02]: now we're just gonna take a look and see
what we have after five days You should
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds should have cracked and open to
tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hope to see that within 24 to 48 hours
Sometimes it could go as long as seven
[SPEAKER_02]: days maybe even as long as ten But really
after that point there might not be too
[SPEAKER_02]: much vigor in the plant So get a new seed
get something that's gonna crack get
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's gonna grow pretty fast So
let's take a look at these paper towels in
[SPEAKER_02]: the ziplock bag, which is typically My
preferred method and you'll notice here as
[SPEAKER_02]: I flip this over There's condensation
which helped to keep the moisture in here
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had to add any water to it I just
kept it in the warm place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paper towel method in the ziplock bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open it up and see what we get Here
we have our results from the paper towel
[SPEAKER_02]: in the plastic bag A this is an old strain
not good results 0 for 5 B was 3 for 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a new strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already put that into the soil I took
those out after 48 hours I just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: let these go to see what would happen and
to kind of give you an example of why you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't do this Because it grows through the
paper towel But see this is an old strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have about six years old It is three of
three those cracked D is another old
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that this one got a nice nice big
root on it These two didn't crack though E
[SPEAKER_02]: another old strain no action there F this
is a new strain that I have and this is 3
[SPEAKER_02]: for 3 and again guys I should have taken
this out 48 hours into it because they
[SPEAKER_02]: have grown through the paper towel and You
want to be gentle on these roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will show you later how to easily
get around this issue So there we have it
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go and check the paper towel in the
plate method Oh, no checking everything 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours into it and my paper plate is dry
Needs more water got to do that now So
[SPEAKER_02]: learning from that mistake quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I replaced the paper plate on the bottom
With something that's not going to absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: the water because again this absorbed the
water the paper towels dried out That was
[SPEAKER_02]: no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need them wet to pop your seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put them in this I've got them wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open it up and let's see what we got
Here are the results of our paper towel in
[SPEAKER_02]: the plate method Nothing going on with
this old strain this new strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a nice tail here one out of three
Here's the old strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that got a tail got a tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two out of three there Two out of three
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's getting a longer tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that there that one didn't
crack Nothing going on with these and then
[SPEAKER_02]: this one which is a newer one three out of
three But I wanted to show you here why
[SPEAKER_02]: it's important that you take These out
after they sprout a little tail,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know right now you can still you could
still manage these you could grab them You
[SPEAKER_02]: could take them you could put them into
your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do whatever I'm just gonna shake
those off right now put those there and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is why you want to take them out
because this Has actually grown through
[SPEAKER_02]: the paper towel so You know, you don't
want to damage the roots when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting them in in this case What I would
do is I would just kind of split the paper
[SPEAKER_02]: towel here And I have my access to it but
again you want to do as little touching
[SPEAKER_02]: and damage to these as possible and There
you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the results from the plate with
the paper towels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how it stacks up Now we'll look
at our direct sows the first direct sow we
[SPEAKER_02]: have is our direct sow into soil and I've
got it all labeled here what they are
[SPEAKER_02]: gridded out easy to keep track of Again
kind of seeing a common theme here with
[SPEAKER_02]: results A and E both older seeds not
having the best time with germination But
[SPEAKER_02]: my newer strains we've got the B two for
two right here And we got F two for two
[SPEAKER_02]: right here So again, the newer strains are
coming in at a hundred percent and the
[SPEAKER_02]: other two older strains I have here one
for two one for two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of holding steady as well
That's the direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So into the soil results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's check out the direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So into rockwool And I just like to add
that normally I wouldn't put this many
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds in one container I only do one seed
per one container But this was a
[SPEAKER_02]: germination test.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was about seeing what popped up This
wasn't about growing these plants any
[SPEAKER_02]: further than this stage that they're
getting to So that's why I have so many in
[SPEAKER_02]: one little space and the same holds true
for the rockwool You know one seed one
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I rock it Now we get a chance
to look at our rockwool, which is another
[SPEAKER_02]: method of direct sowing into a medium We
just placed our seeds in there and this
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't really a method that I use I don't
use rockwool Frequently, but it is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that people do so I thought I'd
include it in my germination tests Getting
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit different results with this
one thing that is holding true is my newer
[SPEAKER_02]: strains Excellent results.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both a hundred percent You got two
for two here on what I labeled as the B
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and then I also have two for two
here of the F strain All of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: strains the older strains They didn't have
as good of results in the rockwool as they
[SPEAKER_02]: did with some of the other methods One
thing I do want to mention about rockwool
[SPEAKER_02]: though is sometimes you'll see the seeds
in here at top It may not look like it
[SPEAKER_02]: popped But if you flip it over all of a
sudden you see kind of like a taproot
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in here So sometimes again,
sometimes it looks like it didn't pop
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not growing up like this But
you flip it over and you see that hey
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of growing up It just kind of grew
down and you've got your root anyways,
[SPEAKER_02]: so just something to keep an eye on with
the rockwool And there you have it After
[SPEAKER_02]: 48 hours I pulled a couple beans that had
already cracked out of the water as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as the paper towels and I put them into
soil because I just wanted to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that they were going to finish the job and
So they did again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a marked here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the two new strains that I've
been doing all three from the Water that
[SPEAKER_02]: cracked popped up the two that I took out
of the paper towel Earlier those have
[SPEAKER_02]: popped up as well And I even took some out
of the water for B and they're coming up
[SPEAKER_02]: to you I got one two three four those
popping up and again No way would I
[SPEAKER_02]: normally put this many plants in one
container?
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was about germination and I just
wanted to follow the job through and make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure it completed its job of popping up
above ground So there you have it guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my results are in paper towel in a
ziplock bag Followed by direct so into
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the two statistically most
effective methods Overall the new strains
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that I would expect to have
germination rate They all performed
[SPEAKER_02]: equally the F was a hundred percent the B
14 of 16 I believe it was and it had two
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with the paper towel in the plate
method, so Overall great results on
[SPEAKER_02]: germination from my newer strains the
older strains and decent not so yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is what it is, but there you
go guys that is kind of a Overall tutorial
[SPEAKER_02]: on how you can germinate in a variety of
different methods So my name is Chad
[SPEAKER_02]: Westport.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining us I am from Twin
Peaks cannabis and I hope to see you again
[SPEAKER_02]: on the perfectly imperfect grow show Thank
you You You You You You
