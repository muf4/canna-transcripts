[SPEAKER_07]: Hello everybody and welcome again to
amazing conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here at the Dankauer and we are
discussing finishing the perfect cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: plant and why your flushing debate don't
mean shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many different ways to have a
great flower at the end of your cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I mean, we spend a lot of time
developing our plants, putting them
[SPEAKER_07]: through veg and flower and all of this
effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do I go about getting the best
possible outcome?
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of conversation happens from
flushing and we thought we'd have a great
[SPEAKER_07]: discussion today and talk about exactly
that here on the Dankauer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, don't forget to sign up for our
newsletter, click like, follow,
[SPEAKER_07]: subscribe, do whatever it is you got to do
to spread the word and share everything
[SPEAKER_07]: getting on in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, without any further ado, let's jump
into the show with our experts and see
[SPEAKER_07]: what's going on when it comes to finishing
the perfect cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're at five oh one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give it like another minute
to let the other people get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've brought up Leah as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a really amazing knowledge when it
comes to humic and fulvic because we're
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about finishing off a little bit
earlier in Jameson when we were talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about kind of planning what we were going
to discuss for the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought I brought Leah in to help
with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Discussion as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's here as support, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to be here, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, Leah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Leah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Corey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Manny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Leah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we doing over there?
[SPEAKER_07]: We connected and recording there.
[SPEAKER_07]: My excellent mate, Corey.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are recording.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are recording on the green room,
and we are also recording on garage band.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a double safety.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're ready to go, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very exciting, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, welcome, everyone, to the Dank Hour,
where we bring experts together to discuss
[SPEAKER_07]: very exciting and interesting aspects of
cannabis horticulture and processing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really always just a fun time talking
about dank subjects and amazing cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: horticulture from really profound experts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had the fortunate ability to spend
and share a time and room and conversation
[SPEAKER_07]: with these people, and they are the
dankest minds I know in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm excited to share them all with you
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So welcome to the Dank Hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, we got a big bag of crap we're
going to unload, and I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can see, it's a very fun title,
Finishing Perfect Cannabis and Why Your
[SPEAKER_07]: Flush Debate Don't Mean Shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a huge fan of flushing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, A, it's a misinterpreted word.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oftentimes, people misinterpret it with a
leeching.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just out of ease and communication and
understanding, we're going to go by the
[SPEAKER_07]: Jorge Cervantes, the classical textbooks
on cannabis and horticulture.
[SPEAKER_07]: That leading towards leeching is adding a
surplus of water to your medium to remove
[SPEAKER_07]: excess nutrients or imbalances,
to rinse your medium of certain problems
[SPEAKER_07]: or issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is leeching.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flushing is commonly dictated as at the
end of flower when you feed nothing but
[SPEAKER_07]: water to starve the nutrient, to starve
the plant and cause chlorosis,
[SPEAKER_07]: in which that the plant uses the leaf to
fuel everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get into that very fun
subject and everything about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to lean away from flushing
and lean into all of these amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: experts.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to lean into all these amazing
experts on what exactly we do to get the
[SPEAKER_07]: perfect flower at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have our own little tricks of the
trade.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have our own.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've read a lot of science fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all have little things that we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So screw flushing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's finish the perfect cannabis plant
and see what each one of these amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: experts are doing on that subject.
[SPEAKER_07]: So first off, to start off, we are going
to say thank you over to Resonate Radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are our conglomerate best pals over
at the green room.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are recording and being an excellent
group.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we know, cannabis grows as a
community and together we grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's amazing to have Corey and the
Resonate Radio over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Projecting our show to get a little bit
more out into the open.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you again, Corey.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just going to give it forward to
our amazing moderators.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it all just kind of follow PTR and
introduce yourself all the way down for
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody speaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you may or may not know,
those that are new to joining us,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is an hour long recorded discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Following that, we do open up a garden
party room.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the show after the show where we
get all these experts together and invite
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody up on stage and just have a
great conversation about horticulture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually trying to keep it kind of dictated
towards what we were talking about during
[SPEAKER_07]: the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: But often we get to go down a few rabbit
holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a casual conversation that isn't
recorded.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also see our shows.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also see our show.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you click on me and check out my
YouTube, we have our first episode up
[SPEAKER_07]: already on our YouTube channel and we have
many more coming to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I was unavailable last week
and we've had to slow down a little bit on
[SPEAKER_07]: production because I had a baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is a beautiful young little lady.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am super excited to have her with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a little bit hectic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you guys so much for taking the
reins and jumping in and doing the show
[SPEAKER_07]: without me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get started, Chaz, if you can
introduce yourself and the group of
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing moderators that we have as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my name is Chaz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been cultivating cannabis for over
20 years in the legacy and recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Started off in Washington, moved down to
Humboldt for about 10 years and then more
[SPEAKER_04]: recently moved to Vancouver, British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a wide range of cultivation
experience from outdoor full term to
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse and mixed light inside of
greenhouse, light depth and indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my preferred method of cultivation is
in living soil beds with the Blue Map
[SPEAKER_04]: system for my watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey everyone, my name is Jamison
Worldborn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the co-founder and general manager of
a fully licensed nursery here in Canada by
[SPEAKER_06]: the name of Big League Genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: We specialize in unique terpene profiles
and high cannabinoid ratios.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we specifically deal with licensed
cultivators in the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been touching the plant since 2007.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, really happy to be here and
happy to learn with everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Corey.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the principal managing partner of
Resonate Cannabis Incorporated.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do large scale cultivation
consultations.
[SPEAKER_09]: This calendar year we've been in Canada,
America, Colombia and now Portugal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just really excited to be on this
panel and share the space with all you
[SPEAKER_09]: lovely human beings.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just really nice to have some time
outside of the madness to just,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, give back and talk about some of
these very, very interesting topics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And today I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everyone, I'm Andrea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not a professional farmer,
but I do like to grow my own medical
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I come from the retail piece more
side of the Irish industry and have a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of insight with regards to what's going on
in the green and specific industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Manny, you're up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, I'm Manny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a yet to be licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: facility in Southern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeder, grower, lover of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're quite busy with your kids,
Josh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you available?
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey everyone, I'm Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in the cannabis industry for
quite some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked in research and development for
three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, I'm in my third year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm currently working to help some ACMP
growers get to the micro license to get
[SPEAKER_05]: into the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Leah, go ahead and introduce yourself
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I'm Leah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a co-founder of a humic and fulvic
company called Quadneutro Products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are purveyors of high quality and
active humic and fulvic that are used as
[SPEAKER_02]: adjuncts to existing nutrient programs to
improve performance and nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have employed an amazing group of
people and I'm really excited to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about this tail end of conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to have a community throw
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got to say hi, I'm London from
UCatagro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an educator and I teach people how to
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an online free course that you're
welcome to check.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you click on my profile, check it out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also do lots of social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you like what you see here or you
like what's going on, don't forget to
[SPEAKER_07]: follow or like any of our moderators or
all of our moderators, please do.
[SPEAKER_07]: As that is how we derive everything
forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget to check out their other
socials or check out everything else and
[SPEAKER_07]: check out the free course and all that
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to show you this really cool
photo I have of the beautiful man next to
[SPEAKER_07]: me, Chaz.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has this epic outdoor plant that he's
just trellis down here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to show you the sheer size
of this single plant in this photo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chaz is not a small person, but he looks
dwarfed in this photo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, while I segue just with just enough
time there, RJ, are you available to
[SPEAKER_07]: introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just finishing off introductions
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm RJ Ellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an extraction refinement specialist
for Canada's leading third party
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little late getting off work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everyone is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited for this conversation
about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long time coming and it's in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stoked to be on the panel, stoked for
this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks everyone for showing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am excited that you were able to
make it, that everybody has been here
[SPEAKER_07]: today because it's been an exciting week
and I am excited to spend some time with
[SPEAKER_07]: some adults and have adult style
conversations.
[SPEAKER_07]: That aren't regarding small children and
what color their poop is today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So very exciting and wonderful stuff going
on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about flushing our plants and
not necessarily flushing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to focus on and alleviate
this, how we're going to finish our plants
[SPEAKER_07]: and how each one of us interactively look
at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all in different systems and we use
a lot of different mediums and growing
[SPEAKER_07]: methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really depending on this could dictate
how you personally finish your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about the last three weeks of
flower and what's actually going on there
[SPEAKER_07]: and what we do ourselves to create the
best opportunity situation for our
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis flower to produce the highest
cannabinoids, the highest terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that we feel is makes the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there is, other than the fact
that there's little, there's definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: some science out there that we should all
have a read and have a look at.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is a certain thing to be said to
each and every individual cannabis is
[SPEAKER_07]: about growing and enjoying growing the
plant and being part of the community of
[SPEAKER_07]: growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not, if it brings you joy to do
something, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if it makes you happy,
go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The world is your oyster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead and experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are our opinions and how we do
things and our methodologies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are all very open-minded
individuals.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think critically of no others.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to hearing everybody's
responses and how they go out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am going to jump around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to go straight to Manny as
he would probably expect.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start with a really kind of
open-ended question towards Josh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when it comes to finished cannabis,
what do you think really defines great
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what, what, what is perfectly
finished cannabis to you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I, you know what, Josh, with kids,
I'm going to throw it really.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you available to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I just had to kind of pull away
from the other room there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so great cannabis to me would
be, you know, something that like
[SPEAKER_05]: generally for myself anyway, I've cured
things for a minimum of two weeks,
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on the cultivar, sometimes much,
much longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so I mean, when you're,
you know, having that kind of a product,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's been hang dried,
it's been hand trimmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you smoke it, it's, you know,
it's very smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, generally white ash is a good
thing, although it's not always indicative
[SPEAKER_05]: of a quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, generally speaking, you're going
to have, you know, a very nice pure,
[SPEAKER_05]: like a consistent color dash at the very
least, and not consistently black,
[SPEAKER_05]: which anyone here can attest will taste
horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, and then depending on,
you know, the cultivar and the quality
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, the THC level of that
strain and the terpene level of that
[SPEAKER_05]: strain, you'll get, you know, a really
nice grease ring on like a joint,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, that isn't always necessarily,
you know, a marker of quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had quality, you know, joints that
didn't get that grease ring, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: those were, you know, the, you know,
the levels of THC may have been lower,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, the terpenes are still
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still got an amazing effect from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those are all just little things that
I kind of look for in a clean product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know, we all know we're looking for
this beautiful, nice, clean smoking
[SPEAKER_07]: product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we see the whiter ash, oil ring,
or very, very sticky resinous products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's things that we look for,
for a great finished product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jazz, what do you do on the tail and
the flower for your plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're doing a lot of extraction,
specifically solventless extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that have any variance in how you
finish your plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what exactly is your methodology about
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I grew in beds, you know,
inside right now, so I can't really,
[SPEAKER_04]: flush my beds in a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I never flush, essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just lay off putting any inputs,
any top dressings or anything onto my
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like half of the plants life, usually like
four weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: At week four or five, I'll stop putting
anything on.
[SPEAKER_04]: My soil so that what is there can get
broken down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the biggest thing that I've noticed in
growing organically is that you can screw
[SPEAKER_04]: up your beds and your finished product by
over applying too much compost,
[SPEAKER_04]: worm castings or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will get a black ash from doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plant will, cannabis is a bio
accumulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it will just pick up everything out of
your soil, good and bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it doesn't need all of those
extra inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my whole approach to it all is just
keeping it as simple as possible and not
[SPEAKER_04]: adding anything basically past the halfway
point of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome, and you're in large bed style
organic, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in four by four beds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all I do is just top dress and that is
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do some supplemental feedings when
the plants show that they're starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe need some more food.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just try to keep it as simple as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you get out of the way with
cannabis and just sort of get the
[SPEAKER_04]: environmentals right, you don't need to,
at least the way that I grow, you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: need to add a lot more to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all my nutrients pre-mixed in my
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where it gets all the goods
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I just try to get out of the way
and create as least stressful an
[SPEAKER_04]: environment for my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not giving your plants
enough food, they'll show it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also will show it in different ways
if you're giving your plants too much
[SPEAKER_04]: food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people oftentimes with cannabis,
have an approach of being a moron where
[SPEAKER_04]: they think just putting more on your
plants and more on your, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: more watering, more nutrients that you're
gonna get a better product when truly you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't need that as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even the recommended dosages on
fertilizers for, you know, if you are
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna use a fertilizer, start off at half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what the recommended dosages and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one could be huge cost savings
and two, you know, you could be wasting
[SPEAKER_04]: your time and money down the drain with
over-applying fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one just thing that I see
overall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will end up, if you
over-fertilize your plants, that's where
[SPEAKER_04]: you get the black ash from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no way of flushing that out of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's in your leaves in the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing solvents extraction, I get a little
bit of a, you know, we don't see that as
[SPEAKER_04]: much in our end product because all we're
doing is extracting the glandular heads
[SPEAKER_04]: and not, don't have anything to do with
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but your plant will be much happier if
you don't try to force feed it and shove
[SPEAKER_04]: everything down its throat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just finding that happy balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you do it enough, you start to
see little nuances.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should be very organic methodology about
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm gonna kind of jump over and just
cause I really, I think this is an
[SPEAKER_07]: excellent point of movement here to really
highlight the differences of opinions on
[SPEAKER_07]: experts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause Chaz and Manny are probably two of
the, I'm gonna say the most experienced
[SPEAKER_07]: here and they have very different opinions
on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna ask Manny, how do you finish
the tail end of your plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we're gonna see here, cause I don't
really know the last three to four weeks
[SPEAKER_07]: of your plants flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you like to finish your plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I know you're a big advocate against
the flushing debate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would love to know a little bit more
detail on your thought process and
[SPEAKER_07]: methodology about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, London.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a misconception with flushing and
what it actually does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you did cover the terminology and how
people have got it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that there's a little more to
it that people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, I think a lot of people have
been taught that the last week or the last
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks that you feed your flower,
nothing but straight water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That miraculously everything that's
accumulated over its flowering cycle and
[SPEAKER_01]: life cycle, that anything bad or bad
tasting is somehow miraculously gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: washed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science shows us that it's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you understand the biology of the
plant, you'll understand that as has been
[SPEAKER_01]: said by a few people, that it is a bio
accumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I do think that you're
onto a good point from what Chaz stated
[SPEAKER_01]: about people overfeeding their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that there are different
levels for different strains that will
[SPEAKER_01]: take different amounts of feed opposed to
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feed needs to be tailored off at some
point in that cycle because that flower's
[SPEAKER_01]: not gonna need that high of concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the flower first starts out,
you know, once you flip and you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: see bud sites, if you're into let's say
week four, that feed regimen, what I do is
[SPEAKER_01]: I start tapering it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will run my feed regimen to a maximum
as what the plant will take.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will go anywhere from 15 to 1800 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I also will use teas in order to
raise my ppm at the same time for the
[SPEAKER_01]: longest period that I'm gonna be at the
peak to around 2800 to 3200 ppm by using
[SPEAKER_01]: the teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this doesn't affect or adversely
affect the flower in any way and helps
[SPEAKER_01]: build a very good strong bud and strong
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will then start to taper off so that by
the time I'm on my last week of feed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down to 100, 150 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'll finish my flower that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use any type of finishing agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any need to feed straight
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've fed your plants properly and
have it here to a schedule where you take
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the max and then, you know,
slowly reduce it back down to as low as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of similar to Chaz in many ways
and we do agree on many, many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, that's always been my go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm done speaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a really interesting
aspect and point that I'm really seeing
[SPEAKER_07]: here is that nitrogen toxicity in the
flowering stage, mid, early, and later in
[SPEAKER_07]: the flowering stage, the worse is the
worse the plant will suffer in this bad
[SPEAKER_07]: flavor or issues in the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So avoiding this high nitrogen toxicity is
probably people were overcompensating by
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to flush it out by trying to do a
derivative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now when you have something like an
ammonical, ammonium-based nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_07]: like nitrogen sulfate, the plant takes
these in as a salt a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually forest-fed, ammonium
sulfate, if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plant takes it in through the water no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how you get these really high
nitrogen base burning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when you get this terrible
flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder if this kind of common over
time and misconception was a way to
[SPEAKER_07]: counteract this balance here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why this whole flushing concept
came about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jameson, I would love to hear a little bit
about how you think about, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: your flowering of course are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you all have a chance to go check out
Jameson's Instagram page, have a click on
[SPEAKER_07]: there because it is quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some beautiful flowers to check
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you use or do at the end,
or in general, what's your kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: mentality and theorem when it comes to
finishing the finest flower that you can?
[SPEAKER_06]: So my school of thought, I follow in the
footsteps of guys who know more than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that, you know, Chaz has been
cultivating in organics long before I had
[SPEAKER_06]: him.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I align completely with
everything he says.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, at the end of my cycle,
I'll top dress with like Leonardite or
[SPEAKER_06]: like a fulvic acid and I'll water that in
to like help chelate some potential heavy
[SPEAKER_06]: metals out of my plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had, like I'm not testing,
so I can't really, I'm not testing a
[SPEAKER_06]: control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I couldn't really say it's making a
difference there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I can say is like, as far as like
my curing goes and my white ash,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I'm able to achieve a white ash
faster when I use a fulvic at the end of
[SPEAKER_06]: my flower versus like not using that same
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, I think that, you know,
very similar to what Chaz said in the very
[SPEAKER_06]: same vein.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I remember when I started growing,
I was, you know, full advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was running the full program with the
boosters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, my, you know, my thoughts
were, you know, the more money I could put
[SPEAKER_06]: into my reservoir, the more money I was
going to get out of that room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it took me many years to
kind of figure out that wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I flushed and, and,
you know, like I, you know, I didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: really have controls back in the day,
but I can tell you that I was feeding so
[SPEAKER_06]: heavy that, you know, I did have nitrogen
toxicity and it probably was a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's, it's a bit of,
you know, how I look at this is a bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: different strokes for different folks,
but like I completely, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a tremendous amount of respect for
Manny and I know, you know, how much time
[SPEAKER_06]: he's put into this craft.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, I, I believe he's got a
lot of great points there too,
[SPEAKER_06]: but as a, as a living soil grower,
like, you know, just top dressing some,
[SPEAKER_06]: some amendments that'll help, you know,
bring things out of the plant is about all
[SPEAKER_06]: that I do towards the end of my cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a huge variation between
when you look at kind of when growing in
[SPEAKER_07]: like a four by four bed and then when
you're growing in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that the, what, how you want to finish
that plant, especially when you're doing
[SPEAKER_07]: these type of systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'd love to jump over and,
and, and have a talk with Anita about how
[SPEAKER_07]: she finishes, how she likes to finish off
her plant and kind of her opinions on what
[SPEAKER_07]: consumers find to be a high quality flower
and what their opinions are on kind of,
[SPEAKER_07]: is this a, is this white ash thing a
little bit more of a, of a head of a
[SPEAKER_07]: classical grower type of stuff,
or is this something you hear on the
[SPEAKER_07]: streets on a regular basis?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, um, personally, I'm actually the
similar with cars, like in the way that I
[SPEAKER_03]: do organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't watch at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just, um, as much as I can,
like my own compost and I have a,
[SPEAKER_03]: a worm farm that, um, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's, uh, it's really,
for me, it's just a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, I mean, like I just had it to
the soil and it's what it needs when it
[SPEAKER_03]: wants it to keep a close eye on the
leaves, the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I'll use exactly what's going
on, um, with the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and I noticed that some
sides, you know, get a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, they start getting a little bit more
like, you know, um, being more nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll, I'll, uh, add amendments as
I go during flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, usually I just kind of let
it go and just keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first year I drew the, um,
and it's all happened in the last couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of weeks and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was heartbreaking, but huge lessons
that were learned that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, for onto the consumer side,
yeah, white ash, that kind of idea
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely, you know, keeping that idea,
um, from people that are using,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, consumers that have been sort of the
community for some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, they look for the white ash
and, and, you know, the rain, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: on, on the joints or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that most consumers that,
especially new ones or ones that don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though there are different strains
really, like they think they're different,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those kinds of types of people,
I think they do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a good finish is if they don't
understand what it is that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they like the smoothness of it and
it's not hard or, um, those kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the descriptors that they would
use, um, from like, you know, somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a layman, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, definitely it does matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've seen products out there that
doesn't burn very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it doesn't burn well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it looks kind of nasty when it's
burning and, um, it doesn't taste that
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes from something that could have
been potentially beautiful, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, the tritone's are all
there and everything, but for some reason
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't finished properly or it was too
late or, and, you know, it oxidizes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's been sitting there for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge problem in our industry
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the amount of time that product is
sitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you can have a perfect finish,
um, have it in a perfect type of a
[SPEAKER_03]: container.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it protects the integrity of the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then it sits there for a while and
it continues to oxidize in the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so your perfect bud now is not so
perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of challenges there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't have any answers for those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, other than, you know, we need to start
treating cannabis, um, as a perishable
[SPEAKER_03]: product instead of a canned product,
like how we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have been, uh, this week I've been
going around, um, trying to find enrolled
[SPEAKER_03]: products for the companies I work with,
um, and buying them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because I don't, I don't want stuff
out there, um, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you're old, I've just been singing to
me, but there's no, there's no,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, anyway, that's another topic
altogether.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, for finishing, yeah, it does
matter to people, but some people know why
[SPEAKER_03]: it matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just like the final product,
just like, you know, fine wine or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have a cheap bottle of wine that
tastes great and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can have an expensive one that
doesn't, doesn't actually taste that
[SPEAKER_03]: great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but they don't really know what's
going on or why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I think that it sells
faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a better, uh, um, return customer
when there's a good time and not earn
[SPEAKER_03]: customers on a regular basis before it's
gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want somebody just to try it
once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was an amazing way to respond to that
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate that, Anita.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to, before we get too far away
from where, cause we were talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: Leonardite and, and Humic there for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I know at the end of flower,
um, and in a lot of systems, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients that are there and available
aren't chelated and they're not quite as,
[SPEAKER_07]: as bioavailable to the plant at all points
in time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd love to give the opportunity over
to Leah to talk a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_07]: like Humic and Phobit can do at the end of
flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Jameson was speaking about using,
um, to, to what, what exactly would do
[SPEAKER_07]: there in the process or how, how it might
help the plant at the end of the flowering
[SPEAKER_07]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, London.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I think understanding what Humic
and Phobit are, and I appreciate that
[SPEAKER_02]: Jameson noted that he was using Leonardite
because there's different sources that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can extract Humic and Phobit acids from.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are natural organic acids that can
be extracted naturally from these highly
[SPEAKER_02]: decomposed layers of earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the sort of the far reaching
decomposed layered before it turns into a
[SPEAKER_02]: hardened coal, like what you would burn,
um, is Leonardite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and Leonardite is very soft and
crumbly and you can extract, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Humic and Phobit gases, which are organic
compounds out of that decomposing matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The benefits of Humic and Phobit really,
well, let's first start with Phobit acid
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually a part of the Humic acid
molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's extracted differently,
using a different extracting method,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be extracted separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Humic acid typically is going to be
negatively charged, much like your growing
[SPEAKER_02]: medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're in a hydroponic system,
uh, whether or not you're using soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: inert media or living soil, the concept is
still the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your root zone is going to be negative,
is typically negatively charged and it
[SPEAKER_02]: draws in positively charged ions or your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Phobit acid on the other hand is
positively charged, but interestingly it's
[SPEAKER_02]: high in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually chelates nutrients
extremely well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it's such a small molecule,
it can actually transfer, transfer
[SPEAKER_02]: through, um, cell walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that it can actually drive
up with that nutrient as a transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically it's like wheels on your,
on your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's lots of nutrients that are
immobile, meaning the plant can't move
[SPEAKER_02]: them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's taken them up, they kind of get
stuck in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where sometimes you find nutrient
deficiencies in your fan leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: but your new growth looks great or your
new growth is looking deficient,
[SPEAKER_02]: but your fan leaves look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's, but usually it's very
indicative of a certain type of nutrient,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, immobile nutrients that are becoming
deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Phobit acid in particular is a really
interesting component to nutrient programs
[SPEAKER_02]: for the main reason that it is oxygen
rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does chelate to lots of different types
of nutrients, both positively and
[SPEAKER_02]: negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it helps to mobilize those
nutrients throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the soil for whatever your
nutrient programming is, whether you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using compost teas, if you're using
synthetics and salts or you're using a
[SPEAKER_02]: combination, which a lot of growers are
getting into more hybrid type situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phobit acid in particular will actually
help the plant mitigate deficiencies and
[SPEAKER_02]: help mobilize those nutrients to where the
plant needs them, but also making them
[SPEAKER_02]: more bioavailable in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phobit acid really should be complimented
with a humic acid because humic acid being
[SPEAKER_02]: a negative charge holds on and attracts to
those nutrients for when the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to take them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also holds onto water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're dealing with drought,
water conditions or maybe your temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: goes off or your pH goes off, they can all
sort of mitigate some of those concerns
[SPEAKER_02]: and those stressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really it's almost like a, um,
a buffer program for your nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't replace your nutrients,
but it really helps the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're putting into your system become
more readily available, be retained better
[SPEAKER_02]: within the media so that you're not losing
it to leachage or in certain outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: situations to gas off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in an outdoor environment,
you know, nitrogen tends to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the combination of the two is I
think something you start to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you see nutrient products that say
organic acids in it, generally they're
[SPEAKER_02]: using some form of a humic or a phobit
acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there's an array of different
quality of humic and phobit acids also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding a little bit more on that
side is I think important to this part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the conversation with in terms of nutrient
availability, if that was sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: addresses your question, London.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're, we're kind of like,
it really points in the direction that
[SPEAKER_07]: it's going to create that chelation and
it's going to allow those, those nutrients
[SPEAKER_07]: that would be harder for the roots to
access and bring up into the system,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and therefore kind of maximizing your
dollar at the end, because we're talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about even what, every time we talk about
adding something in a nutrient,
[SPEAKER_07]: a product, anything to our soils,
this is money that we're using at that
[SPEAKER_07]: point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Time, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we're using this, uh, in these M
admins cost money.
[SPEAKER_07]: We might be able to Anita.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fantastic example.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you got to go check out her space,
she's a, she's just vermiculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's supposed to fly in and got her
own nitrogen source and a lot of her
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients from that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so there are amazing ways,
but that costs time and effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got to understanding where these
are in something like a humic and a phobit
[SPEAKER_07]: product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this can really help, um,
especially the end of flower get the best
[SPEAKER_07]: and the max out of, uh, your system at the
very end and kind of utilize as many
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients that wouldn't usually be
available.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of what you've seen kind
of in the outcome Jamison, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: After using products like, uh,
with that base.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, actually nothing but positive
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: In London, if I could add quickly,
just in relation to the conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: about, you know, the topic today about
flushing and just, you know, water
[SPEAKER_02]: finishing or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when you use a humic and a phobic,
in your program, interestingly,
[SPEAKER_02]: when, when you're having this debate about
whether you flush with water or how you
[SPEAKER_02]: taper things off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've also seen that even if you do do
stress tests with just feeding water,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's enough nutrients within that
media that it helps the plant taper off in
[SPEAKER_02]: that finishing stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not necessarily having to starve
your plant, which some people are of that
[SPEAKER_02]: count.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, others are more in the mind of to,
to taper it off and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily need to be adding
additional nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're finishing a plant,
but the plant won't be starved per se
[SPEAKER_02]: because those nutrients are still
available within the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're kind of depleting it,
not necessarily because you're just not
[SPEAKER_02]: adding any more to, um, your program,
but it, those nutrients are still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just whether or not the plant can
access it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I think Jamison, you might be
finding that as well as when you use the
[SPEAKER_02]: humic and the phobics at the very end and
the tail end of that flower stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still enough nutrients within the
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the plant's getting essentially what
it needs and not starving it, not
[SPEAKER_02]: stressing it, but you're still getting
that finishing benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, my media is, it's an, it's a
no-till dad, so it stays the way it is and
[SPEAKER_06]: continues on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have a question as, you know,
I was kind of taught that phobic was sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of down plant towards the soil and humic
was more soil towards the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Towards the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you wanted to use a phobic at the
end and not a humic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I, am I not properly educated from
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you advise using both, um,
in concert or how would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely in concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the interesting thing about phobic
acid is it, it, like I said, it binds to
[SPEAKER_02]: the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you're using it systemically,
so we have, we have growers that use the
[SPEAKER_02]: phobic acid strictly with their compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they can make the nutrients within
those teas more mobile and more
[SPEAKER_02]: bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's excellent as a foliar as well,
because by nature, phobic acid has some
[SPEAKER_02]: trace to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's minute, but there are some additives
that you can add to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also excellent when you combine it,
if you're doing any kind of an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM, it works like a wetting agent and it
helps those additives better permeate into
[SPEAKER_02]: the canopy and help assimilate into the
plant a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we recommend using humic and
phobic, humic for sure in the ground at
[SPEAKER_02]: the root zone, it's the root zone
activator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps to support that root development.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps to feed the biome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're using with your living soil,
it becomes a carbon nutrient source for
[SPEAKER_02]: your biome, which helps those populations
flourish, which is obviously going to
[SPEAKER_02]: better empower that nutrient cycling that
naturally happens between root zone and
[SPEAKER_02]: the biome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but fulva can be used a hundred
percent in systemically in ground and
[SPEAKER_02]: furrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it in your nutrient system if
you're running an irrigation or irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can also be used as part of any
kind of an IPM or foliar program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So while we have a quick pause here,
I'm going to jump in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the dank hour, get growing
together, where we talk about,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, where we get the dankest minds and
cannabis that I know together to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis horticulture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we are having an amazing discussion
right now about finishing the perfect
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not going to lie to you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done a little bit of a click bay here
because you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hate this term flushing and I
hate this ongoing debate that's going on
[SPEAKER_07]: about how we need to remove this or put
that in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're talking about utilizing and
maximizing the potential of our plant at
[SPEAKER_07]: the end part of the cycle and what each
individual does to create the best outcome
[SPEAKER_07]: that they have that we've had.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked with various experts about
their methodologies and soft processes on
[SPEAKER_07]: how to really accelerate and create that
balance as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we were talking a little bit about um,
no till Jameson and using humic and fulvic
[SPEAKER_07]: and I wanted to bounce over to mania a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we, he mentioned this starvation,
this, this plant, um, starvation and you
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned it before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now when we're talking about flushing,
often what is, what is talking about is
[SPEAKER_07]: actually people leach their plant at the
end of flower where they add so much water
[SPEAKER_07]: to the medium that it's at least a minimum
of threefold of the volume of the media of
[SPEAKER_07]: the medium.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, to rinse the plant of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would this do to the end of flower?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, theoretically, you know,
you see people say, oh, this is a good
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The starvation of the plant causes
chlorosis, which causes the breakdown of
[SPEAKER_07]: nitrogen in the leaves, which creates a
better tasting plant is often what is spat
[SPEAKER_07]: out in some word shaped format.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I am dictating at this point in time
to you, Manny, what are your, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that what happens?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, is that a good thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that have any benefit to the actual
flower of the plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower of the plant by that point is
our is already been structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been nurtured.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to take that away from the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we keep saying the flower is a
bioaccumulator as a bioaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everything that it's pulled
into, uh, into itself, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: release because you're running straight
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through it, no matter how much you're
stressing it or starving it, whatever's
[SPEAKER_01]: there is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the leaves that are going to,
that are going to, um, give up before,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, any of that would even good anywhere
near the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I left my mic on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the plan is going to eat up the
nutrition and it's leaves to protect the
[SPEAKER_07]: most important part of its vital system.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the most important part?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what's the plant always trying to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's trying to reproduce, right,
Manny?
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are the buds, the callus.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to pull nutrients from that
spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that is, that is the sex of the
plant and it is going to do everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: its power to sustain that sexual part of
itself for reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's, you know, that's its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by, you know, running straight water
for even three weeks, it's not going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to the mud whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, uh, you know, some people
like to say bro science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just going to say it's an old
wives tale, you know, that people started
[SPEAKER_01]: telling each other that that was working.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as we've learned more about
the plant and learn more about the biology
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, we can now see that that type of
thinking isn't correct at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, it's a point of
argument for a lot of people that swear by
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but I can provide all kinds of
documented scientific evidence,
[SPEAKER_01]: which shows that it's absolutely useless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the, um, the definition of the plant
as a bioaccumulator spells it out for you
[SPEAKER_01]: that no flushing isn't going to do
anything for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, unfortunately, uh, you know,
uh, I'm not saying those people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything wrong to their plants because
really they're not, but the thought
[SPEAKER_01]: process that they're using isn't correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you touched on like a really
awesome point, Josh, go ahead there before
[SPEAKER_07]: you speak, but just beforehand,
I just want to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That really important point that you
dictated there is that we are all growing
[SPEAKER_07]: and there are all things, even when you
have huge or vast amounts of experience
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's, it's, it's important to have
that open mind to other ideas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Manny just said it so well,
there's nothing wrong with doing that if
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I'm going to do it this way,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why, and I think that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I love this panel of experts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to give you guys all an
awesome shout out to James and Manny,
[SPEAKER_07]: Josh, Leah and Corey, because you guys do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have this awesome conversation,
but show that there's a reason for it and
[SPEAKER_07]: that this is our thought process.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is why you could, or so in other
words, so really thank you so much for
[SPEAKER_07]: having that open point of protection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Josh, I appreciate you holding on for me
for a moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to also add there,
I think, uh, you know, potential reason
[SPEAKER_05]: this issue had come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I remember when I was a young grower,
I, you know, being the skeptic decided,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm going to test this,
you know, flushing or not flushing because
[SPEAKER_05]: back then I, I flushed my plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but back then, you know, like it
didn't dawn on me that I should be feeding
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant based on its stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just like, well, I'm just going
to keep feeding it in week seven and eight
[SPEAKER_05]: and nine, the same way I have,
you know, in four or five and six.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so at that point, you, you know,
I was giving the plant way too much
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients for what it needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why it accumulated so much and
had such a terrible finish as opposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: the product that I had flushed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, now, you know, after having learned
more about the plant and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: learning how the growth stages work and
what the plant is requiring in those
[SPEAKER_05]: stages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I have, I mean, the,
the PTR that I put on there was,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, from a sample that I had taken samples
at week eight, nine and 10, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, the, the plant just to see which,
you know, week was best for that
[SPEAKER_05]: particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but that said, and this is from the
week eight, at the week eight,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was still getting almost it's like
almost its full nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, week nine had gotten dropped down to a
much lower rate and week 10 it was still
[SPEAKER_05]: at that much lower rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I mean, you know, four,
I mean, this isn't perfectly white,
[SPEAKER_05]: but four, you know, a week eight was,
you know, still having quite a decent
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think it's more important to note
that like the, the dry and the cure also
[SPEAKER_05]: really have an impact on the final
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you can still like the flavor in this,
you can tell that there was, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that little extra nutrients comparatively
to the week nine and week 10 samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the terpene profiles are also
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, I just wanted to kind of add
that, that, you know, sometimes people
[SPEAKER_05]: might be thinking that this, you know,
the alternative to flushing is giving a
[SPEAKER_05]: full seed, which, you know, that's not
entirely the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you've got to feed it based on
the stage of growth that it's in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you're feeding really matters.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think like when you're, you're looking
in and our beautiful organic beds like
[SPEAKER_07]: Jameson and Chad's are working in the
plant has these ability to pull what is
[SPEAKER_07]: necessary when it needs it and,
and able to figure out everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it makes it really quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Corey, are you available?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to chat a little bit?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you were on a phone call a little
bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, are you available now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will continue forward anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were talking, um, about flushing and
finishing our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So talk a little bit about my process on
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I, something other people in this
room is I kind of do, I'm kind of closer
[SPEAKER_07]: to what Manny does as in I do organic and
hydroponic kind of together.
[SPEAKER_07]: As in I use ammonium based nitrogen as
well as, uh, organic nitrogens and teas
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff like that to really boost the
plant up as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So no, that wasn't, uh, no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I'm just doing my, my little one's
crying.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got a little bit sidetracked there
and distracted my apologies guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just kind of running through what I
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I'm doing, I do at three gallon
pots and my idealism is that I can create
[SPEAKER_07]: as much life into these pots as possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the plant's going to take what it
needs, but also has everything that it has
[SPEAKER_07]: in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I've tried different cover crops to do
and allow for higher doses of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_07]: such as clover.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find you get a lot larger of a blood,
but, um, at the finish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, where if you use things like a
psyllium, which are little flowers,
[SPEAKER_07]: they can create a smaller bud because
they're sucking a little bit more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when it comes to the last part of the
end of my cycle is I tapered down my
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrient system a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm probably running close to what Manny
runs, maybe a little bit higher at about
[SPEAKER_07]: 200 PPM.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but I'm also in a drained waste
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So every time I, I water, I water with
about 10% runoff and check my PPM.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a great dictation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to note that there
are even some um, strains and,
[SPEAKER_07]: and phenotypes that really, if you
overfeed, it can be way more detrimental
[SPEAKER_07]: than if you underfeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some plants just love, love to eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just give them as much nutrients
as possible and really push them up to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, 30 to 2800 PPM at their highest
in mid to mid flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can really push them up high and
that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But trying to maintain it when you have a
plant that can't take those high PPMs and
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to push it up all the time isn't
necessarily the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes reducing them can be,
and then it's a cost point, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're putting, depending on the amount
of nutrients that you're putting into your
[SPEAKER_07]: system is coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why when I do a lot of like
gallon pot work where you have a drainage,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's okay to check your PPMs on the way
out and see kind of what they're sitting
[SPEAKER_07]: at.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always have 10% runoff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's a little bit backwards
because I'm doing hydroponics and
[SPEAKER_07]: organics, but I find this way I can really
tally and find out how much is in and
[SPEAKER_07]: being a rinsed out of the system,
how much plant is taking up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the big learning curve.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that organics is so challenging
for a lot of people is cause you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: plan and work ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Jameson, your bed is like
immediately ready to go right after,
[SPEAKER_07]: right after your flowering cycle is done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can pop right on top of it,
maybe a mental little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you do in the transition period
from the end of flower to the last one to
[SPEAKER_07]: running your next round in the same bed?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your flip?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your transition there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still learning soil biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'll do is I'll go to ANL labs
here in Canada, I'll get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm lucky to have friends like,
you know, Chaz or like lately I've been
[SPEAKER_06]: working with Joshua Steensland who's,
you know, analyzed soil tests for me since
[SPEAKER_06]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sort of work with him to figure
out the right strategy for an amendment,
[SPEAKER_06]: a top amendment and then water in and just
roll like, you know, you can plant in and
[SPEAKER_06]: then sort of send your test off and amend
it after.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you don't need a lot to get
those starts going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I mean, I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, you know, only on my third,
you know, third year of doing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, you know, the living soil is just
a wormhole that you, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: continue to go down.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about yourself Chaz?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing in between?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do something similar as Jamison does.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it depends on, you know,
sometimes I'll skip a cycle, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it's just my home grow to get it
tested, but I try to get it tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not adding more of something that
doesn't need to be in my soil because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really, about keeping each element,
you know, your micro and macro nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: in the proper ratios within your soil for
your plant to uptake them correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you just keep on blindly amending
over time, you don't know what the plan is
[SPEAKER_04]: utilizing and where your bed stands and
you can run into issues that then might
[SPEAKER_04]: result in a lot more fertilizer to bring
up the ratios and the correct level than
[SPEAKER_04]: you would have if you, if you would have
just, you know, as you went, checked your
[SPEAKER_04]: soil through laboratory testing and keep
it within those, the sort of ranges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are getting your soil tested,
you'll get a lot of different opinions on,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, who's got a good lab testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: My advice on it is just stick with the
same one that you're going with and go
[SPEAKER_04]: from there because each lab is calibrated
differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you go from one to another,
you won't be able to interpolate,
[SPEAKER_04]: understand your data over time because it
will be skewed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just stick with one lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get the big screenshot of what
their testing is like, and you can adjust
[SPEAKER_04]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm done.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like exactly what I like to
point out at all times.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is always about creating community
around you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you're going to choose a soil
company that's going to test your soil out
[SPEAKER_07]: on a regular basis, stick with them and go
through them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all developing businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing happened just because there's
one error one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it mean you should bounce around
immediately?
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're crappy businesses out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely make the right decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: That depends on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's about community giving
maybe a smaller guy a chance once in a
[SPEAKER_07]: while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it very important in this space?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you guys all let me bring you here
to this wacky, weird Tuesdays and we all
[SPEAKER_07]: have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually, we're at the top of the
hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we usually like to do is end our
recorded session.
[SPEAKER_07]: And about this time and then bounce over
over to the garden party room to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I do like to allow any of the
moderators that had any closing statements
[SPEAKER_07]: that they wanted to say before we go over
to the garden party room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you all come and join us.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the show after the show where
everybody comes up on stage and we have a
[SPEAKER_07]: great conversation about cannabis and
become a community.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can talk about anything you want up
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be polite and join the conversation
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, do any of the moderators,
if you want to flash Mike and let me know
[SPEAKER_07]: if there's any closing statements you
would like to bring up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, we will shut down the room and
pop over to garden party and continue this
[SPEAKER_07]: delightful conversation on cannabis
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, well, thank you each and every one of
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here every Tuesday at five o'clock
Pacific Standard Time to six o'clock
[SPEAKER_07]: Pacific Standard Time every single Tuesday
on the Dancower Club.
[SPEAKER_07]: So click the little greenhouse,
click the follow, click the like,
[SPEAKER_07]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Join us over on in the Dancower Club
garden party, cannabis garden party,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is going to open just shortly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also do another show on Saturdays with
RJ where we talk about post harvest
[SPEAKER_07]: processing consumer packaged goods and
what happens to cannabis plants when we
[SPEAKER_07]: make extractions and the processing
industry and the thought process,
[SPEAKER_07]: because that is an amazing in-depth area
of cannabis that we don't get a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: options to talk to and that RJ down there
is our resident expert.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have some other amazing people
coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some guests coming in as guest
speakers as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to keep it quiet,
but stay tuned, stay excited and stay
[SPEAKER_07]: entertained and educated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for being part of the
Dancower.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate each and every one of you and
come over to the garden party.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you there, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ciao.
