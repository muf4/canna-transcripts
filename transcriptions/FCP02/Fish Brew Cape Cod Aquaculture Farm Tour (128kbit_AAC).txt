[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Blue Stream Aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our Cape Cod facility,
built in the 1860s as a trout hatchery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where me and my family call home,
and we call the home of Fish Brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where Fish Brew started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first three products, Bold Flow and
Epic Flow, are derived from this farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this is an old-style
flow-through farm with some updates with
[SPEAKER_00]: solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our solar canopies do two things for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide us with energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These panels actually store the energy and
batteries, so at nighttime we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: battery power.
[SPEAKER_00]: These solar panels operate and run about
85% of our energy use that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: year-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were installed five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, some of these parts of
this hatchery are older than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part of the hatchery was actually
originally used as a tannery in the 1700s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old stone wall around it, this pond
here, houses our rainbow trout.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we walk through the hatchery,
we'll see more updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These raceways here were reinstalled about
four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tore out the old wooden raceways,
but we kept the sand by the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: raceways.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, our wells are putting
water into the raceways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artesian wells, about 40, 35 to 40 feet
deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a tank full of rainbow trout.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were fished from two years ago,
Spawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sand bottoms of these raceways
and the beautiful water that we get from
[SPEAKER_00]: an underground sand river that runs
through the bottom underneath the property
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives us the great quality of water
to start with for raising the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also, with the sand bottoms,
gives us all the ecology over 160 years
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been developed that's really
important to part of our fish group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This raceway here travels all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 400 feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fish in different sections all the
way down, depending on year, size and
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over this way, we have two undeveloped
raceways that we're in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: redeveloping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Installing these panels over here,
these concrete panels that we poured.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give us a little more capacity
in the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This farm is primarily used for fish leave
here to get stocked around the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we move to another part of the
hatchery, this part of the hatchery,
[SPEAKER_00]: also older part of the hatchery with sand
bottom raceways.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often ask, how do we move the fish
around the farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the way we move them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a stainless steel tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use this for hauling the fish when
we deliver them to people's ponds for
[SPEAKER_00]: stocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a battery-operated aerator on the
back of the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fill it with water, add the fish and
move it around, pull up alongside the
[SPEAKER_00]: tank, pull the valve and dump the fish in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time of year is what, during the
summer, is primarily what we're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: grading and moving fish, getting ready for
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tank here is one of our older
raceways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wood-lined with a sand bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fish here are a Brutstock rainbow
trout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 350 fish in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start spawning rainbow trout about
mid-August to the end of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here is our hatch house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we hatch and spawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we take the eggs by hand
stripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring them into that building and we
have incubators in there where we spawn
[SPEAKER_00]: the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now there's nothing in there because
spawning season is still a month and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our experimental greenhouse where
we do a lot of different experiments with
[SPEAKER_00]: our fishbrew products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started testing the fishbrew products
about six years ago, at least four years
[SPEAKER_00]: before we brought them to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take a walk inside there,
but you can see here's some of our outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens that have also been treated with
fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our blueberries, which I've seen fishbrew,
bold and hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, they're very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we have quite a bit of fruit
developing on our blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: it only being the first week of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take a quick walk through our
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our greenhouse where we do a bunch
of different types of experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hydroponic NFT where we do
testing with hydrolysate and fishbrew
[SPEAKER_00]: EPIC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here, this is a floating raft
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing different stress tests with
plants right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some soil beds that we've
developed, making living soil from our
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tomatoes, aloe plants in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a variety of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants here are all on our rise and
thrive product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a trial in here right now for
growth, stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move through, there's more tanks in
here that have fish.
You
[SPEAKER_00]: can see these are small rainbow trout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to utilize all the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my prized zucchini plant this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant was completely grown on bold,
fishbrew bold products.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other fertilizers used.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's a very healthy plant,
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves are much larger than my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some dry product that we're
starting to develop of fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very light product, has a very nice
lot of properties of NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also has a very nice for making a compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small brewers that we do testing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come around this side of the farm as
we exit the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come out into another system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we collect a lot of our
waste for the fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a series of tanks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flow through with recirculating
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a drone filter where we take off
the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water then passes through a biological
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water comes in from our pond in the front
of the farm, passes through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water that is being introduced by the
pond overflows into another series of
[SPEAKER_00]: raceways on the backside of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these tanks here house rainbow trout,
brook trout, and brown trout.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the tanks are covered for netting to
keep the birds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move down here, this is a second
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, we have a container where we
harvest the waste that later becomes our
[SPEAKER_00]: fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another drone filter there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking the waste off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very slow moving filter, constantly
sucking off the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it into this tank here,
which is a 1,000 gallon holding tank that
[SPEAKER_00]: we aerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the beginning of fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, this tank is transferred into
our barn where we have different brewing
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to enter into one of our
brewing rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are located in our barn on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: These brewing containers are both 250
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have on storage at least 500
gallons of the bull product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we do all of our bottling and
labeling in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have our storage for hydrolystate
that we bring from our other farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rise and Thrive, which is one of our
newest products, that's a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cape Cod Farm and New Hampshire Farm
giving us different bacteria, fungal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and protozoa from the bull product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to utilize both farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the third brewer that has the Rise
and Thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quick overview of our farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you guys a quick,
we tried to do it on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were unable, unsuccessful to keep a
feed going, but that gives you a general
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of what our farm on Cape Cod
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be hopefully soon bringing you some
views of our other farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, please contact
us and follow us on fishbrew.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.
