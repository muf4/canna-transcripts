[SPEAKER_00]: This is greenhouse two, we're a couple
weeks behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got the legendary OZ from Thomas
up front here, and then my OZ Kush F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran through them before, but it was
kind of a poor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This round, every plant gets 100 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same as like next door, I've got 200
gallon pots over there, we're running two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants per pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just top these again this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of plant them when they were lanky so
they're top heavy, but they're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my eightest code selections
I had outside already flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's like a mid July flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only one number 10 out of four or
five selections flowering right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to re-bed her and maybe work
with her down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get her flower sampled and
see what chemo type, most of them are CV
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, these are going to be the fall
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
