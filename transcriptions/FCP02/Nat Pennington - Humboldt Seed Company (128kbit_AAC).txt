[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes When you wake up And you feel like
you need a little up When you're down and
[SPEAKER_00]: out And you need to get a little higher If
you feel like you need a blessing And you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel a little high today Welcome to the
church of Cali High Cali High Cali High
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Cali High Episode 54 I'm your
host Chenzo Nico and this week our special
[SPEAKER_02]: guest is Nat Pennington owner and CEO of
The Humboldt Seed Company As planting
[SPEAKER_02]: season draws near we talk with Nat about
the new strains at The Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Company the selection and process for
making a stabilized strain improved
[SPEAKER_02]: quality of autoflower strains how to save
a phenotype with tissue culture trends in
[SPEAKER_02]: strain popularity and commercial versus
personal seed choices we also talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: the current problems with the legalization
of cannabis in California and more coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from a science background Nat is one of
the best informed people in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding and as in our previous interviews
with him he lays out a cornucopia of
[SPEAKER_02]: valuable knowledge before us in this
must-see episode Nat also appears in Cali
[SPEAKER_02]: High Episodes 39 and 23 stay tuned Cali
High is blessed to be here with Nat
[SPEAKER_02]: Pennington for the third time Morning Nat,
how are ya?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning doing well excellent So you
know we were going to talk about a few
[SPEAKER_02]: things today the state of cannabis but
before we get to that part I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: find out what's going on with The Humboldt
Seed Company So what new strains are on
[SPEAKER_02]: the lineup this year?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some pretty exciting new strains
out this year We we've been definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: putting a little bit more giving
autoflower some more attention and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: been sort of like a gradual process over
the last I don't know seven eight years
[SPEAKER_05]: but it took a while for you know like to
convince ourselves that there was you know
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean the biggest thing that I always
kind of point point out is that I really
[SPEAKER_05]: truly believe that there's no baggage that
comes along with the autoflowering trait
[SPEAKER_05]: and so you know when people say
autoflowers are are this that or the other
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean if they're referencing any anything
other than the fact that they flower
[SPEAKER_05]: automatically without having to change the
light then it's a it's a false stereotype
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that's something that I've
learned is is a fact I think it's got a
[SPEAKER_05]: bad rap well I mean yeah there's been
people that have you know said that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're just I've heard things like oh
they're all crap or whatever stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: that and just like firsthand experience
there's you can through just I'm not even
[SPEAKER_05]: talking like I'm not talking about gene
editing or anything weird just through
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional breeding practices selective
breeding you can essentially just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: cut that trait that is the you know no
matter what I'm gonna flower after a month
[SPEAKER_05]: and a half or after a month whatever and
paste it into whatever style cannabis you
[SPEAKER_05]: want so whatever you know you can have the
dankest cannabis in the world could easily
[SPEAKER_02]: be an autoflower yeah that's great for
outdoor farmers right said one more than
[SPEAKER_05]: one crop I would imagine it's it's
convenient for a lot of people I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: we've got it we've got a guy who is I
would say sort of a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: pioneer who you know what what I have
always kind of assumed is like are the
[SPEAKER_05]: least likely client that we would have as
a genetics company especially for our
[SPEAKER_05]: autoflower varietal strains is is a like
indoor hydroponic type grow environment
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've got this indoor hydroponic
person who is just absolutely loving being
[SPEAKER_05]: able to run autoflowers because you know
it's just zero you know pests zero
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogens and it's just this like
incredibly low low maintenance process of
[SPEAKER_05]: just like sticking the seeds in to you
know he uses like sort of the rockwool
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah hydroponic growing style and
just you know plugging the seeds in
[SPEAKER_05]: getting them a few inches tall
transplanting them into the bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: rockwool cubes and into the main you know
what what you would normally think of as a
[SPEAKER_05]: veg space and then just goes and there's
no like having to you know shut the lights
[SPEAKER_05]: down for 12 hours and and because of that
the plant is actually photosynthesizing
[SPEAKER_05]: and being able to build flower the entire
time that you know I think that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: leaving do you know whether he's only 20
hour like 18 yeah so some people go 18
[SPEAKER_05]: some people go 20 and it actually is just
like it's a more efficient way of growing
[SPEAKER_05]: and you you might not necessarily think
that because you're like oh there's like
[SPEAKER_05]: more electricity but actually that
electricity is being used by the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: build more flower and it cuts down on on
the number of hours therefore it saves
[SPEAKER_05]: power right well overall you can cut you
can have a quicker life cycle overall
[SPEAKER_05]: because you you know thinking about you
know clones and having to keep mothers and
[SPEAKER_05]: that whole process of getting something to
where it's a you know a five inch tall
[SPEAKER_05]: clone or or whatever that takes a lot of
energy and and people don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_05]: think about it they're like well I just
pay you know eight dollars a clone or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever and but that eight dollars is is
energy that they've spent yeah yeah and
[SPEAKER_05]: you know so long story short there's I
think a lot of different applications that
[SPEAKER_05]: people don't even realize the obvious ones
are like well you know we don't have to do
[SPEAKER_05]: light depth in in the outdoor growing
environment which is a huge advantage and
[SPEAKER_05]: just also just a lot of like agronomic
advantages and then we always think about
[SPEAKER_05]: just the personal grower and we think it's
easier for them as well just yeah have
[SPEAKER_05]: some plants in the backyard and you can
actually do it you know at least two times
[SPEAKER_05]: in a summer right for sure and you know if
your state says you can only have six
[SPEAKER_05]: plants or something well you can probably
have two harvests and so then you can kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of have 12 plants yeah exactly like the
the big new strains that we've released
[SPEAKER_05]: are the potty mouth which is was actually
kind of a collaborative project with our
[SPEAKER_05]: friend jason ridge line farms who's who's
a fellow humble farmer who just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like won emerald cups you know year after
year and is an excellent grower obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: so what's it like it's the reason that he
gave it the name potty mouth is because it
[SPEAKER_05]: was so it's the flower structure of it is
not a lot of leaf not a lot of fluff it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just like all the the bracts that make up
the best part of the cannabis flower yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: and so when it grows it just looks like
this little hot monster like you know kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of all gnarly like that and and that so he
kind of came up with that name we were
[SPEAKER_05]: like screw it you know the cannabis strain
names are are off the wall these days I
[SPEAKER_05]: know anyway so if we can have stuff called
meat breath and yeah whatever else yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah then you know so anyway it's it's an
awesome one and we just got the test
[SPEAKER_05]: results back and it tested it 34 and
that's through like a lab in California
[SPEAKER_05]: that's known for integrity which you know
not I don't want to say but there's just
[SPEAKER_05]: so much going on with the labs yeah
everywhere that and the stupid race for
[SPEAKER_05]: THC we don't really personally give it
that much credence but you know it
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely seems like it's it's a driver
for economics yeah people get the high THC
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers and you know yeah they want to
feel 34 is pretty high I must say yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: well especially from like a lab that's
that's legit and then the farmers daughter
[SPEAKER_05]: is another one that was just this like
shining star in our fino hunt efforts in
[SPEAKER_05]: the last year and that one was a pleasure
to be able to get out to the world what
[SPEAKER_05]: would you compare these two I mean so the
potty mouth is like this you know what
[SPEAKER_05]: seems to be what people are gravitating
towards in the sort of vast commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace is the purple gassy and purple
strain yeah which you know we've always
[SPEAKER_05]: had really good purple gassy strains like
our all gas oh gee is kind of a purple
[SPEAKER_05]: royal highness is another one that's like
that that that we've had for a long time
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's just funny how I mean there was a
few years where people thought for some
[SPEAKER_05]: reason that purple cannabis was it turned
purple because there was something wrong
[SPEAKER_05]: with it like they didn't have deficiency
in a nutrient or something like that and
[SPEAKER_05]: of course we always knew that it was just
genetic and we always were like oh the
[SPEAKER_05]: purple stuff is beautiful you know and it
it's good and stony and and all that but
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just funny how you know the trend
will go one way and then it'll go another
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I was gonna ask you about trance
quite some time quite a while where you
[SPEAKER_05]: know people were just like we don't want
any of that purple don't give us any
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics that have the purple and now
everybody wants purple flash forward four
[SPEAKER_05]: years and and everybody's super interested
in the purple yeah one of your plants
[SPEAKER_05]: turned purple for me yeah yeah some of
that yeah and the lesson for me as a
[SPEAKER_05]: breeder is just has always been more and
more just like trust trust your instincts
[SPEAKER_05]: as a both a smoker and a breeder smoke
what you like who gives a shit you know
[SPEAKER_05]: like what you hear is supposed to be the
best because you know everybody's
[SPEAKER_05]: experience is different and and the only
way to know is to get out there and get in
[SPEAKER_05]: touch with the plant and and check stuff
out experiment grow your own uh-huh oh
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so one of my questions was you know
have you noticed trends towards certain
[SPEAKER_02]: strains this year's as compared to years
past and I see that that kind of leads
[SPEAKER_05]: into it yeah the purple gas is is really
popular right now which is great because
[SPEAKER_05]: we we have lots of that stuff yeah it
still has to be high in thc that the potty
[SPEAKER_05]: mouth strain is really high in thc and
it's purple it's gassy the vanilla cream
[SPEAKER_05]: pie is another one that's purple and gassy
and it's really high in thc some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: most strongest turpent ones like the all
gas og and the royal royal highness like
[SPEAKER_05]: those ones are probably some of the most
gassy just rank really you know super
[SPEAKER_05]: pungent strains that we have in that kind
of gas genre those ones you know I
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't say that they're gonna like crush
it with with the test results but
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly if people just want to grow
something that you know they're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: enjoy those are really good candidates for
that and and both of those the royal
[SPEAKER_05]: highness and the all gas og are quick
finishers too so they they only take you
[SPEAKER_05]: know till like 50 days or more late
september rather than mid october yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah that's cool what about farmers
daughter that one is that one's just it
[SPEAKER_05]: was this amazing fino that stood out to us
actually it was kind of funny because you
[SPEAKER_05]: know we take all these clones from fields
and fields partnerships with big farms all
[SPEAKER_05]: over the you know really all over
california and and keep all these cuttings
[SPEAKER_05]: because we don't want to lose any things
so we take it the cuttings like before
[SPEAKER_05]: they really are all the way in flower and
then code everything so we can go back and
[SPEAKER_05]: reference it but every now and again
there's something will just be so amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: in one of the breeding chambers that will
go and try to you know we haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily cut every clone in the
breeding chambers and that one was one of
[SPEAKER_05]: those and it was like almost touch and go
we were like all right we're gonna try to
[SPEAKER_05]: re-veg it and get it to come back out of
flower and and capture some clones off of
[SPEAKER_05]: it so that we can preserve it because it
was just this unbelievable standout
[SPEAKER_05]: individual yeah yeah that's so cool yeah
out of a breeding chamber that was like i
[SPEAKER_05]: don't even know how many siblings it had
but there were you know at least i would
[SPEAKER_02]: say a hundred yeah so you have to keep
like a hundred mothers going until you
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out which one you want right or
something well that's i mean every year we
[SPEAKER_05]: do thousands of them and we do that but
mostly that's just on stuff that we're not
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinating so that's like right on fields
of sensa mia whereas we don't tend to take
[SPEAKER_05]: cuttings off every single thing that we're
pollinating because i mean one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things about pollinating stuff is it kind
of changes the way that the flower is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to express because it's full of
seeds right and so but you can still tell
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot about you know i mean it's you can
almost tell just as well basically that if
[SPEAKER_05]: it looks really good and smells really
good even if it's got seeds in it so
[SPEAKER_05]: occasionally we'll find something that's
so amazing that even though it's flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: and seeded and and yada yada yada that
will just do our best to get it back and
[SPEAKER_05]: put it back into vegetative you know get
it back in veg and and get cuts off of it
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and the farm that's how the farmer's
daughter daughter started it was just
[SPEAKER_05]: something that stood out so much that we
were like oh my god you know and and i
[SPEAKER_05]: honestly i basically did tissue culture to
get it to come back from being in flower
[SPEAKER_05]: because um you know that is a way to
essentially kind of clean stuff up and
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah yeah baby and pamper something
that may otherwise be uh kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: jeopardized or whatever yeah interesting i
can't wait to try that actually yeah no
[SPEAKER_05]: and really like all it is the the essence
of tissue culture is starting with
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's so you know like the only
thing that's alive inside the the little
[SPEAKER_05]: petri dish kind of environment is the the
cannabis plant no no powdery mildew no um
[SPEAKER_05]: funguses no obviously no insects no uh
hopefully no pathogens even though viruses
[SPEAKER_05]: and things can live inside tissue but so
what you do is you start by taking it a
[SPEAKER_05]: little tiny cutting and first we rinse it
in in soapy water essentially just like a
[SPEAKER_05]: detergent so you can use anything like
like dawn for example and we'll shake all
[SPEAKER_05]: of the little cuttings inside a a mason
jar essentially of detergent and then the
[SPEAKER_05]: next step is uh pull them out kind of dry
them off shake them off even rinse them if
[SPEAKER_05]: you want and then we put it into a a
second bath that's a chlorine bath and so
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll just completely wipe out anything
that um might you know sort of challenge
[SPEAKER_05]: the the rooting and the continued growth
of the plant and then we'll just go
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of going totally into the tissue
culture media we'll go into a classic
[SPEAKER_05]: clone scenario but just keep it a lot more
um airtight and a lot more you know
[SPEAKER_05]: isolated a lot more that's cool use
rooting hormone and and that's been an
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing trick it's kind of like a hybrid
tissue culture in a way but when when
[SPEAKER_05]: we're trying to get something to go from
full full flower and save it and keep you
[SPEAKER_05]: know preserve the genetic get it back into
veg we found that that can be helpful
[SPEAKER_05]: especially you know if if it's something
that you find uh and it's outdoor for
[SPEAKER_05]: example there's you know just more like
potential for yeasts and molds and things
[SPEAKER_05]: like that yeah and you can't dig the plant
up and put it back under 24 hour light so
[SPEAKER_05]: it can be easier if if you're doing it if
you're happening if you're growing in a
[SPEAKER_05]: pot a lot of people will just be like oh
i'm just gonna take the pot and bring the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant back into the you know the veg room
and you know a month and a half later
[SPEAKER_05]: there's little sprouts coming out that are
are veg but you know when you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: this in a big field kind of environment
you can't really do that yeah but you know
[SPEAKER_05]: the advantages of the big field is that
you can pick the one out of 10 000 because
[SPEAKER_05]: you have that many more to look at uh so
you know there's advantages and
[SPEAKER_05]: disadvantages to all of it but that's how
farmer's daughter came about and it's it
[SPEAKER_05]: was a it came out of a humble pound cake
and then it's always interesting because
[SPEAKER_05]: people are always of course the first
question is like what's the cross and for
[SPEAKER_05]: us a lot of the time we're never like
releasing a genetic that's just a times b
[SPEAKER_05]: equals this litter of mutts we're actually
trying to make a a line you know like
[SPEAKER_05]: we're you're stabilized strain a real
strain and and in seed form that involves
[SPEAKER_05]: many many iterations of of back crossing
and sort of stabilizing and in that
[SPEAKER_05]: process you know it may have started five
years ago by just crossing two random
[SPEAKER_05]: things but a lot of the time what it ends
up being for us is like you know m69
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed with m27 then the next year we
chose uh you know g number three and
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed with x number four like none of
them ended up being uh strains because in
[SPEAKER_05]: as in and of themselves they were just
individuals that were selected right and
[SPEAKER_05]: but but at the end of the day it it makes
something and it's sort of hard to like
[SPEAKER_05]: reference back um what that was but yeah
yeah so pound cake and um i think the
[SPEAKER_05]: vanilla cream pie was those were sort of
like basically offshoots of of that when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're developing something too you're
gonna you know you kind of like set a goal
[SPEAKER_05]: that let's just say you know go back in
time um 15 years when we were developing
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry muffin or 12 years or whatever
it was and um you know at some point there
[SPEAKER_05]: may have been like before it's entirely
stable and everything it smells exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: like a blueberry muffin there could be one
that you're just like oh my god that
[SPEAKER_05]: smells like apple pie and and and then all
of a sudden like you know that may be bbm
[SPEAKER_05]: number 36 and and so you move bbm 36 into
a new lineage and a new new category you
[SPEAKER_05]: know and you're like okay i love this
individual so much that i'm now gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: start to move it into like a new you know
a whole new genetic or a whole new strain
[SPEAKER_05]: and and that's you know perfectly normal
and fair um and you know you say then of
[SPEAKER_05]: course someone's going to be like well
what's what's the cross on apple pie and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're just sitting there thinking like i
mean it's not even really a cross because
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it was just a pheno yeah just a
variant of the of the cultivar or it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: variant yeah that's a good way of putting
it um but i think you know so many
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis breeders are at this stage where
they're just like you know they don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: the room to like look at this stuff at a
grand scale so they don't have you know
[SPEAKER_05]: acres to be able to devote to having
breeding chambers and and fields to to run
[SPEAKER_05]: things and and they don't uh you know a
lot of it's happening indoor so you see a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of like all right well if you're doing
breeding indoor there the chances that
[SPEAKER_05]: pollen contamination from one area to
another are actually much higher because
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got like hvac yeah and you know
like literally i've i've bred indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: plenty and you you got to go in there
every time you change to the next thing
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to go in with like a pressure
washer and like get the corners and just
[SPEAKER_05]: it's crazy because the pollen actually
sticks everywhere it lives longer and
[SPEAKER_05]: it'll stay in the vents and the heating
and stuff and you know you'll go and
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll be like there's no way like the
only source of pollen that i could have
[SPEAKER_05]: you like see a couple seeds in your next
batch and you're like the only pollen that
[SPEAKER_05]: was ever in here it was six months ago but
it'll actually stay um so it and amazingly
[SPEAKER_05]: enough it when you're outside and you've
got nature's sort of pressure of of wind
[SPEAKER_05]: and and dew and and all these you know
heavy duty sunlight and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a lot less likely that you're going
to have you know like there's no way six
[SPEAKER_05]: months lingering pollen yeah no pollen is
left yeah at the at the farm right now you
[SPEAKER_05]: know aren't sure but um so we have a you
know but when we do breed indoors uh oh
[SPEAKER_05]: you know so i guess i was just saying like
so what you see a lot of with a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: seed companies is just you know like one
you'll take you know oh the white runs is
[SPEAKER_05]: really popular so i'm just going to take
the white runs and i'm going to have it
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinate this room and i'm going to put
30 different strains in there and just you
[SPEAKER_05]: know that's basically your seed line for
the year is um white runs times girl scout
[SPEAKER_05]: white runs time gelato white runs oh gee
white runs times blueberry muffin and and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's cool if if your customers just want
to like really have a fino hunt if they
[SPEAKER_05]: want to look you know if they're trying to
grow something that's going to basically
[SPEAKER_05]: have you know a litter of mutts yeah but
the reality is mutts are great dogs um but
[SPEAKER_05]: you know our goal is to get purebred lines
and then do true hybrid breeding yeah i
[SPEAKER_05]: have to admit it's it's not easy and even
though we're like putting a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: energy and effort towards it it's uh
cannabis isn't is a keeps you on your toes
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah sure does um is there a difference
between the choice of strains commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are asking for as compared to like
small medical people like myself yeah i
[SPEAKER_05]: mean i don't want to say that there's
necessarily like a difference so we can't
[SPEAKER_05]: be like here's um i mean we actually do
have uh kind of like a a sub set of of our
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics that were that we endorse for
commercial people um much more than just
[SPEAKER_05]: let's just say the whole catalog so yeah
you know this time of year you know every
[SPEAKER_05]: day we're doing what we call genetic
consultations with farms and and uh you
[SPEAKER_05]: know across california and definitely you
know almost every conversation involves
[SPEAKER_05]: having to be like oh you know i don't know
if you want to grow something like and i
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want to throw these strains under
the bus because they're awesome in their
[SPEAKER_05]: own right but you know i don't know if you
want to grow uh trainwreck or jack harrow
[SPEAKER_05]: or um blue dream kind of stuff because
it's just really hard to sell anything or
[SPEAKER_05]: like even our old strains that we created
like like ppb and uh i don't know it it
[SPEAKER_05]: just depends but but it's really so based
on thc what like what dispensaries will
[SPEAKER_05]: buy and unless you have your own brand and
and unless your brand specifically speaks
[SPEAKER_05]: to people that are above the whole thc you
know that are smarter than than the
[SPEAKER_05]: general population in that they don't just
go into the store and say what strain has
[SPEAKER_05]: the highest thc that's what i want to buy
so if you have a brand that that's doing
[SPEAKER_05]: education and kind of you know has your
your differentiation is that your brand
[SPEAKER_05]: has like really unique turpins or you know
like and and our blueberry muffin is a
[SPEAKER_05]: perfect example of it because anybody who
has ever experienced it knows that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just this incredibly pleasant high and
like a wonderful thing to grow it smells
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing you know oh yeah i have my freezer
is full of bags of you know various grades
[SPEAKER_02]: and sizes of your the blueberry muffin
yeah and you show your friends and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: just like oh my god that smells you know
it's seductive it's like it was also the
[SPEAKER_05]: densest bud i've ever grown ever yeah
they're like rocks it's super easy to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: and so there's there are those ones that
and dispensaries that ironically will tell
[SPEAKER_05]: you that like all anybody wants to buy is
really high thc except there are a few
[SPEAKER_05]: things that they go and ask you know some
a lot of people go in and they're like you
[SPEAKER_05]: know well i don't care what the thc is
just give me that blueberry muffin that's
[SPEAKER_05]: what i want and so there's some things
like that that will but aside from that
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately we have to tell people
because we care a lot about our community
[SPEAKER_05]: and we know like the times are really
really tough right now in california
[SPEAKER_05]: because you know i don't want to totally
blame it on on the way that the new law
[SPEAKER_05]: has been applied but um there's an
oversupply of cannabis and it's very hard
[SPEAKER_05]: for some of the you know original small
family farms to survive and yeah we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to talk about that in a few minutes
here but um let me ask you one or two more
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about the amazing era um if you
had to if you were like stuck in a desert
[SPEAKER_02]: island what three of your strains would
you want to have some buds of i wouldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have buds i'd want to have seeds
that's as long but it's seeds in them okay
[SPEAKER_05]: um i'd probably bring seeds of uh
blueberry muffin you know to be honest i
[SPEAKER_05]: might bring some trainwreck seeds or maybe
even freak show um just because it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: this to fool the natives it's this kind of
an uplifting like i'd really like
[SPEAKER_05]: turpentine high that you get from that
kind of turpentine train wreck smell but i
[SPEAKER_05]: would definitely bring something that was
just like a super high octane gas you know
[SPEAKER_05]: so something that would something that
would knock me out help me sleep be real
[SPEAKER_05]: ethereal kind of like a pain so you know
along those lines it might be an og bush
[SPEAKER_05]: it might be uh headband a humble headband
it might be um the all gas og and then
[SPEAKER_05]: like i said the blueberry muffin and then
the uh shoot i maybe i would bring some
[SPEAKER_05]: auto flower too because i want to have i'd
want to have weed like every fresh weed
[SPEAKER_05]: every month yeah i'm gonna have to try
some of those by the way either that or
[SPEAKER_05]: else i'd build like a palm light depth out
of palm um you know i i follow your
[SPEAKER_02]: instagram page and um i get excited i got
really excited i saw you had gone down to
[SPEAKER_02]: columbia is that right so and i know you
have other countries you've been to so are
[SPEAKER_02]: there any land race cultivars you've been
able to find that you've stabilized that
[SPEAKER_02]: compare favorably with established strains
here in california um and we did we you
[SPEAKER_05]: know and and ben was the one who was down
in columbia most recently and jamaica i
[SPEAKER_05]: was down in jamaica a couple years ago we
did you know of course everybody always
[SPEAKER_05]: talks about the the lamb spread in jamaica
and um so we kind of went out on a on a
[SPEAKER_05]: mission to find that and the cool thing
about them is that there's like there are
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely a lot of unexplored uh amazing
qualities to be found in those varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: and the unfortunate thing about them is
you know they often test at like between
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 and 15 percent yeah so you know you
bring them back and sometimes you know we
[SPEAKER_05]: want to hybridize them and we did that a
little bit with the the lamb spread and a
[SPEAKER_05]: friend of mine um at full moon farms
actually has kind of found a really cool
[SPEAKER_05]: cross that i think came from something
that we initially crossed and then he you
[SPEAKER_05]: know really sifted through the the
population but full moon is in jamaica no
[SPEAKER_05]: full moon is actually humble it's right
helen that's that's it right full moon
[SPEAKER_05]: farms nick yeah it's like full moon 707 is
the instagram handle i believe uh-huh he's
[SPEAKER_05]: he's really cool and he's been working on
that for a while so you know give him
[SPEAKER_05]: credit um but it's a challenge because you
know for one thing there's like the idea
[SPEAKER_05]: of keeping the land race totally pure
which we right we definitely did that with
[SPEAKER_05]: the uh the lamb spread we were like well
we're not gonna um just focus on on
[SPEAKER_05]: outbreeding we're gonna continue to keep
it pure and stable and so you know the the
[SPEAKER_05]: work involved with that is like busting it
out every four years and and making sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that you know it's either that or putting
it in like cryogenic storage which is
[SPEAKER_05]: possible you know um but uh once we once
weed is not ridiculously expensive to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: in a you know in a license i think that
there will be cool breeding groups that
[SPEAKER_05]: are just like you know we're gonna keep
propagating uh heritage strains yeah from
[SPEAKER_05]: different places and and just kind of keep
you know because it's not it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: expensive to do and it's it's a little bit
of a labor of love and i think people
[SPEAKER_05]: would want to to grow those i mean a lot
of people ask us for some of those
[SPEAKER_05]: landrace um like for example those
landrace uh lamb spread seeds we also have
[SPEAKER_05]: lambs landrace ethiopian seeds from the
blue nile river we have landrace columbian
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds that ben picked up when he was down
there we have some landrace do you know
[SPEAKER_05]: where in columbia he was um the sierra or
the sierra nevada actually was a place
[SPEAKER_05]: that i think that he had found some seeds
actually i know that that sounds like to
[SPEAKER_05]: california but there's also a mountain
range in columbia yeah yeah yeah um yeah i
[SPEAKER_02]: remember santa marta gold i remember
completely red columbian black brown green
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know that the crazy thing is like
if you look back i think on our youtube or
[SPEAKER_05]: on our instagram either one you'll see we
have we made a little video of our
[SPEAKER_05]: adventures in jamaica and uh very cool
it's just crazy because you go there and i
[SPEAKER_05]: mean one of the saddest things is that we
went around and we were immediately like
[SPEAKER_05]: talking to you know the oldest rostas that
we could find and and uh we'll learn very
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly that you know unfortunately
western culture had gotten its you know
[SPEAKER_05]: like spoiled a lot of of the real rootsy
culture that had developed around jamaican
[SPEAKER_05]: ganja by bringing seeds in that weren't
jamaican yeah and and just by like you
[SPEAKER_05]: know popular culture being like i mean
because we would go around and we'd ask a
[SPEAKER_05]: group of rasta growers and and we weren't
just like i was driving around the island
[SPEAKER_05]: with bob marley's nephew-in-law for
example who who was born and raised and
[SPEAKER_05]: knew everybody there and and so it wasn't
like some random white guy from california
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and and we'd ask that the guys like
you know where's all the good original
[SPEAKER_05]: jamaican seeds at and they'd be like oh
yeah um let we'll be right back we got og
[SPEAKER_05]: cush seeds we'll give you and we're we got
sour diesel seeds did you ever come across
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody mentioning a strain called the
cotton i do feel like we did because um
[SPEAKER_02]: shea core uh cat corey's son of third
world he plays for a damian marley's
[SPEAKER_02]: damian marley's bass player but uh we were
having a conversation he goes yeah bob
[SPEAKER_02]: bob's favorite strain was something called
the cotton yeah i definitely heard about
[SPEAKER_05]: this down there and i think what people
have to remember and realize is it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: you know the concept of strain especially
when you're talking about you know stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that's propagated by seed it's just
there's such a vast yeah potential
[SPEAKER_05]: interpretation you know like yeah like
we're like all right well we're not going
[SPEAKER_05]: to call something a seed like a strain
until we've at least inbred and back
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed like two or three generations
after fino hunting and finding something
[SPEAKER_05]: unique um whereas you know 99 percent of
what we'll we see is just like oh you know
[SPEAKER_05]: i took these two random clones that i had
and and crossed them and and i'm just
[SPEAKER_05]: going to call that a strain and it's like
so then what happens is then there's like
[SPEAKER_05]: you have 30 different things that come out
of that that are all really like everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: who buys those seeds is just going to call
them all the strains whatever strain it is
[SPEAKER_05]: and so you could have a million different
iterations of of something and and uh it
[SPEAKER_05]: might they may not be alike at all and so
you know and it depends like how you
[SPEAKER_05]: describe it like if you say that it smells
like um bananas and and as that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: strain name um and one of them doesn't
smell at all like bananas then that one
[SPEAKER_05]: may not end up being called banana kush or
whatever it is which that helps a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit and i think that's why so many people
um you know use the food references and
[SPEAKER_05]: the food names in in naming strains
because it kind of just helps you give
[SPEAKER_02]: like a defining reference yeah yeah
exactly yeah i noticed that thailand had
[SPEAKER_02]: become the first country in southeast asia
to make uh cannabis legal in some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fashion and they're shooting for
recreational but for me you know when i
[SPEAKER_02]: started smoking i only smoked landrace
either bud or hash and when when finally
[SPEAKER_02]: like thai weed came around in the late 70s
um it was perhaps the most developed of
[SPEAKER_02]: all the landrace strains in that it was
that was the first you'd get that was
[SPEAKER_02]: seedless first of all and it was on sticks
and they were all so amazingly spicy and
[SPEAKER_02]: strong it was probably the strongest weed
that i'd ever had but it sure would be
[SPEAKER_02]: nice to get some of that i don't know if
it still exists you know what i mean yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: the we we had some thai i mean there were
definitely you know and and you never know
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure unless you go and pluck it from
from a field in thailand yourself but
[SPEAKER_05]: there were definitely thai varieties that
that were passed around and and we
[SPEAKER_05]: experimented with them and they were
actually really awesome a lot of them were
[SPEAKER_05]: very frosty uh and that was something that
stood out for me about the thai varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: is that they were kind of like reminiscent
of of a some kind of like a haze variety
[SPEAKER_05]: where the buds they weren't super dense or
anything like that but but it was
[SPEAKER_05]: incredibly frosty and yeah several of them
went really late uh so yeah they grow
[SPEAKER_02]: really long yeah really like almost a
sativa type thing yeah definitely yeah i
[SPEAKER_05]: would say sativa and and good for that
more equatorial type tropical climate
[SPEAKER_05]: because you know when you have the quicker
flowering varieties they just don't even
[SPEAKER_05]: have a chance to really grow very much
before they're ready to flower and then
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah yeah especially when on 12 12
hours of sunlight 12 hours of darkness
[SPEAKER_05]: year round at the equator it's definitely
a whole other yeah the first plants i ever
[SPEAKER_02]: grew were some humble or excuse me um big
sirs holy weed and thai seeds that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: from the thai weed and the thai finished
in january whereas the big sir holy weed
[SPEAKER_02]: was done in october you know it was it was
wild so but those thai varieties are
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome and we tested them i remember we
did do some thc testing on it and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy because like a lot of those things
they won't come up high for for thc but as
[SPEAKER_05]: far as like getting you stoned and how
hard it hit you and everything i mean it
[SPEAKER_05]: was just like you know a lot of them were
just incredibly stony and i mean there's
[SPEAKER_05]: so much that's yet to be and unfortunately
where human nature wants to have things
[SPEAKER_05]: spelled out you know we want to like
understand stuff before we can really
[SPEAKER_05]: believe our own instincts so you know one
thing that i've noticed is if you take a
[SPEAKER_05]: cbd rich variety and mix it with a thc
heavy variety and and roll a joint of it
[SPEAKER_05]: like you may be getting less overall thc
than if you had just rolled the joint out
[SPEAKER_05]: of all thc but but um it gets you it just
like totally gets you blitzed and
[SPEAKER_05]: entourage effect with yeah it's it's crazy
and it's it's almost like i didn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not something that i wanted to do
very often because it would like if i
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to seriously to just get you know
take a few puffs and just go straight to
[SPEAKER_05]: bed go to sleep um feel no pain kind of
situation that's that would be what i
[SPEAKER_05]: would probably do and and you know these
days actually the older i get the more i
[SPEAKER_05]: think about that i'm like well maybe i
should just have my nightly ritual and and
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke some cbd and some thc and just get
zonkered but uh i have a friend that
[SPEAKER_05]: recommends that yeah that's what i that's
how it affects me and i don't know it
[SPEAKER_05]: could affect other people differently but
i mean one thing i just know for sure
[SPEAKER_05]: without a doubt is that we know maybe five
percent of all there is to know about
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis via lab testing and our bodies
know everything it needs to know about it
[SPEAKER_05]: just by uh experience and you know yeah
but experimenting and you know we always
[SPEAKER_05]: encourage people to to experiment slowly
and cautiously like don't get super stoned
[SPEAKER_05]: especially if you have any
responsibilities but uh i don't know like
[SPEAKER_05]: that worst thing that happened to me with
one of those cbd thc joints was uh
[SPEAKER_05]: thanksgiving and i i kind of didn't base
the turkey because i was like literally so
[SPEAKER_05]: stoned i like everybody in my family
literally asleep for four hours in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle of the day when the turkey was in
the oven they're shaking me they're like
[SPEAKER_05]: what happened i'm like i hope that it was
a joint of the of willy g uh cbd and and i
[SPEAKER_05]: can't even remember i think it was like
all gas og or something yeah yeah but um
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah interesting it's the thai all of it
it's there's so much to be explored yet
[SPEAKER_02]: well if you ever need anybody to go to
thailand for you i'm volunteering right i
[SPEAKER_02]: speak thai and i know where it was
supposed to have come from yeah i went
[SPEAKER_05]: down to borneo in malaysia and like
indonesia area for some of the activism
[SPEAKER_05]: work that i was doing and never been to
thailand though but i've always wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: go yeah yeah it's an interesting place
it's beautiful i fell in love with the
[SPEAKER_02]: culture um so well let's go on to part two
here uh so humble team company was a
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor at the emerald cup just last
december is that right yeah and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: did you notice then signs of farmers being
affected by the current taxes and the
[SPEAKER_05]: price crash of cannabis yeah that was i
mean it sort of started in what would you
[SPEAKER_05]: say hallie like it started in july or june
or july when we started seeing prices just
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah tank out before before it was like
happening slowly and then it just like
[SPEAKER_05]: dropped hard yeah so i mean that's your
daughter that's my daughter hallie she's
[SPEAKER_05]: over here shout out to hallie she's at
work where it works hi hallie i'm vince
[SPEAKER_02]: some people call me chenza you remember
but you know i think there we've all seen
[SPEAKER_05]: these like pits and peaks and valley or
you know whatever you want to call it of
[SPEAKER_05]: the prices of cannabis especially in the
last 10 years and we have seen it go as
[SPEAKER_05]: low as like 500 a pound before in
california and then uh a year later it was
[SPEAKER_05]: fourteen hundred dollars a pound and um
and we're talking about outdoor red uh for
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever reason indoor tends to fetch a
higher price i think you know the data
[SPEAKER_05]: shows that it's really just based on looks
because there's no there's no higher
[SPEAKER_05]: turpentine or higher ghc it's just like
yeah but um and obviously it costs a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: more to produce indoor flower but um in
any case the uh the rebound that we saw in
[SPEAKER_05]: like 2019 2020 like the spring of 2020
fall of 2019 where it went back up to
[SPEAKER_05]: fourteen hundred dollars um that was
encouraging for a lot of us because we
[SPEAKER_05]: were all sort of expecting the the new um
paradigm of growing in california with
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational cannabis to to have an effect
on prices and everything like that and i
[SPEAKER_05]: mean unfortunately it doesn't really seem
to translate some people that are
[SPEAKER_05]: listening might you know go and get their
cannabis at dispensaries and uh the bummer
[SPEAKER_05]: is is that when the prices drop for
farmers they don't really seem to get
[SPEAKER_05]: cheaper at the dispenser it doesn't
translate to the buyer it almost never
[SPEAKER_05]: does and i don't know why the heck well i
do know why that is but you know the the
[SPEAKER_05]: way that california made the thing there's
so many links in the chain that and each
[SPEAKER_05]: link is a business so you've got
distributors and people that are doing
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging and and processing and and then
finally dispensaries and and of course the
[SPEAKER_05]: labs too and all of those companies have
to turn a profit or else they're not a
[SPEAKER_05]: company anymore and so just you know
imagine each one of them just chipping
[SPEAKER_05]: away at the overall you know value of the
cannabis and then
[SPEAKER_05]: so then basically the farmer is the one
that's sort of like you know it's the for
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever reason that you would think that
farmers might be able to get together and
[SPEAKER_05]: and fix the price and be like you know
we're not really going any lower than 500
[SPEAKER_05]: because when you go any lower than 500
you're probably about just about losing
[SPEAKER_05]: money but um the the problem is is that
they're even if we tried that it just
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't last for one thing it's not legal
there are laws against price fixing yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and then not specific to cannabis but
specific to agriculture and then for
[SPEAKER_05]: another thing there is always just going
to kind of be like that scab i guess you
[SPEAKER_05]: know like yeah the person that's going to
cross the picket line and and go back to
[SPEAKER_05]: work even though the prices are not you
know there's not a living wage and and i
[SPEAKER_05]: don't blame some you know those people
it's not really their fault it's just like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a product of what we've created as
our society and and a product of you know
[SPEAKER_05]: the the law is not really looking out or
benefiting the small business small family
[SPEAKER_05]: farm um which you know is is nothing new
in the united states and yeah of course
[SPEAKER_05]: you know whether that we'll see how it i
think there's like some kind of a hope
[SPEAKER_05]: that the massive consolidation of wealth
that's happening is just going to somehow
[SPEAKER_05]: resolve itself in this country um i don't
think so or you know there's going to have
[SPEAKER_05]: to be some kind of an intervention because
you know clearly um if we keep going on
[SPEAKER_05]: the same trajectory uh there's going to be
you know 10 or 15 people that own
[SPEAKER_05]: everything in the world and the rest of us
are going to you know essentially live to
[SPEAKER_05]: serve them in some respect yeah and uh
power it what do they say absolute power
[SPEAKER_05]: corrupts absolutely so it's just yeah
there are just some like facts that that
[SPEAKER_05]: would say that this isn't going to just be
able to work like this forever so i don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know like was it like that guy robert
reich he has that movie that came out he
[SPEAKER_05]: calls it fixing capitalism saving
capitalism i like robert reich and and i
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of like that because i'm not you know
as i've gotten older i'm maybe a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit less of a radical but uh i do believe
in some of the principles of capitalism
[SPEAKER_05]: but there are some things that are just
like you know planned obsolescence of it
[SPEAKER_05]: almost like yeah continue anyway in
california was there were supposed to be
[SPEAKER_05]: we all voted on this legalization template
that probably one of the biggest rallying
[SPEAKER_05]: points around it was this like five year
period of time where the existing cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: people the people that were doing the
medical stuff the people you know that
[SPEAKER_05]: were farming in these rural areas that are
kind of like the nappa of cannabis so on
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth that those folks would be
they would essentially not allow more than
[SPEAKER_05]: an acre to be grown under any one business
uh to allow companies that you know to to
[SPEAKER_05]: bolster their infrastructure to be able to
then be in competition with bigger more
[SPEAKER_05]: capitalized corporate you know investor
venture capital types and uh because it
[SPEAKER_05]: was obvious that they were coming and you
know why not why wouldn't they yeah it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: potential moneymaker so they're gonna give
it a shot and but then that rule just
[SPEAKER_05]: vanished and overnight after we you know i
personally actually did not vote on it
[SPEAKER_05]: which was really weird for me i voted yes
the first time are we talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: one acre what no we're talking about just
legalizing recreational cannabis i'm sorry
[SPEAKER_05]: and and i actually like learned after
voting yes the first time and it didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't pass that time and then people
specifically were doing education on like
[SPEAKER_05]: what some of the problems with the the
current legislation were going to be and
[SPEAKER_05]: so by then i was a little bit wiser and i
didn't actually vote voted no on prop 64
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah which was so weird for me to to do
that but um you know i would venture to
[SPEAKER_05]: say that that was the right vote because
unfortunately i mean it would have delayed
[SPEAKER_05]: people having access to cannabis like they
do it would have delayed it by another
[SPEAKER_05]: couple years at least so that we could get
something better but um yeah it just it
[SPEAKER_05]: seems like there were a lot of a lot of
things that were hidden in it and or or
[SPEAKER_05]: just the way that it was um enacted what
was disingenuous to what it was supposed
[SPEAKER_05]: to be so yeah that's politics you know
like i mean how many people get elected on
[SPEAKER_05]: a platform and then never uh actually
follow through with their commitments and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's too often 64 in california it did not
follow through on its commitments at all
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know is it it's not i mean it's a
little bit affecting humbled seed company
[SPEAKER_05]: but but it's massively affecting the farms
in the emerald triangle yeah and so um how
[SPEAKER_02]: are those problems playing out on the
ground with the farms that helps humbled
[SPEAKER_05]: seed company i mean like we service like
we're not unfortunately we can't really
[SPEAKER_05]: tell the big giant farms that want to buy
our seeds that you know to go kick rocks
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's what we built the company
to serve and so you know i'm not maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe i'm a little ashamed to admit that
we sell the seeds to the farms that come
[SPEAKER_05]: and want to buy a hundred thousand and but
um you know the the ones that are local
[SPEAKER_05]: here that i mean we kind of go try to go
in above and beyond to do what we can to
[SPEAKER_05]: help and you know i think one of the
biggest things is just educating the
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer that you know there's something
to there's something really good about
[SPEAKER_05]: small batch craft cannabis and people
should seek that out and try to support it
[SPEAKER_02]: economically yeah the wine industry is is
uh something that seems comparable i mean
[SPEAKER_02]: i mean yeah very friendly towards small
wine wineries right and yet right not the
[SPEAKER_05]: same with cannabis well but the problem is
is that like i know now when i go you know
[SPEAKER_05]: shop for a bottle of wine i know the boons
farms from the small winery you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: moon stone winery that yeah that is is
like you know the local small batch winery
[SPEAKER_05]: and when i want i you'll never catch me
buying boons farm but you know like when i
[SPEAKER_05]: want a nice bottle of wine that i'm really
gonna like enjoy and and think about it
[SPEAKER_05]: and and have you know a nice experience
and a dinner whatever it is then i will
[SPEAKER_05]: always buy those wines that i know story
behind it and i trust it and everything
[SPEAKER_05]: like that and uh you know occasionally i
might get a bottle that's more just like
[SPEAKER_05]: general mid-grade wine but um the problem
now is that you just can't tell like you
[SPEAKER_05]: walk into dispensary and there's no
differentiation between boons farm
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis uh and the the local real craft
small batch cannabis because you just it's
[SPEAKER_05]: such a new thing that we just don't know
who's the budweiser from the you know lost
[SPEAKER_05]: coast brewery or whatever and you know
miller high life to the uh sierra nevada
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever and and so yeah um that's
unfortunately everybody can put craft
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis on their jar no matter how huge
their farm is and and so it's it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take a while for that yeah what would
you recommend for the state to do to save
[SPEAKER_05]: the small farmers the state needs to like
do actively be giving tax rebates and and
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's kind of out there yelling like
stop the campus taxes we need to do it and
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're gonna try to combat the the um
black market whatever you want to call it
[SPEAKER_05]: the gray market market and and i think
that's kind of i think that's kind of told
[SPEAKER_02]: me i couldn't call it the black market
because it contributes to a racist you
[SPEAKER_05]: know type of black white thing but then
that's kind of just ridiculous like i
[SPEAKER_05]: think cannabis shouldn't ever be illicit
it shouldn't ever and it's like people
[SPEAKER_05]: should want to buy it from dispensaries
because it's convenient and because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: tested and because they know what they're
getting yeah consistent and safe um not
[SPEAKER_05]: not because they're like forced to at
gunpoint so um i don't think that like
[SPEAKER_05]: stricter punishments or harsher laws are
the answer at all and and i do think that
[SPEAKER_05]: uh um i do think that that people should
be the tax rebates should be going to
[SPEAKER_05]: small farms that i mean one of the biggest
problems that i see is like you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: certain amount of red tape that's involved
with running any business at all and like
[SPEAKER_05]: accounting it's permits it's uh taxes it's
red tape it's like all of that stuff that
[SPEAKER_05]: is the admin of the business and one of
the issues especially with cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's this like level of of admin
and effort that you have to do it's kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of like the barriers to entry or even the
the maintenance of those those permits and
[SPEAKER_05]: and licenses and and then taxes and and
reporting and accounting all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: is like this level here and if you're a
farm that's you know 80 acres it there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit more work associated with that
but you know if you're if you're only 10
[SPEAKER_05]: 000 square feet if you're like a really
small farm you basically are doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: same amount of bullshit that a farm that
is 80 acres has to do um they're just
[SPEAKER_05]: adding an extra zero on the end of their
spreadsheet so you know you may be doing
[SPEAKER_05]: accounting and it may be you know six six
digit accounting whereas you could just
[SPEAKER_05]: all of that stuff is just the same amount
of work uh if you just add another zero on
[SPEAKER_05]: the end of it but it just equates to
infinitely more more money or potential
[SPEAKER_05]: for profit and and my I guess my solution
would be figure out ways to um either drop
[SPEAKER_05]: down some of the like generally some of
the barriers to entry for the small
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses or or the how hard it is to
maintain yourself in in the industry
[SPEAKER_05]: because if you're such a small business
then you know the opportunities to have
[SPEAKER_05]: the things that the they're worried about
like robbery or diversion like the the
[SPEAKER_05]: risk is lower because there's less you
know cannabis to be uh stolen or sent sent
[SPEAKER_05]: out the back door or whatever and so there
should be less red tape but there's not
[SPEAKER_05]: and and I think that's kind of one of the
biggest things that's killing small farms
[SPEAKER_05]: I think um and and another thing that I
think that's ironic is that you know we
[SPEAKER_05]: touched a little bit on how for whatever
reason indoor cannabis sells for a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: more money but that the tax is the bit one
of the biggest tax I think the biggest tax
[SPEAKER_05]: is the the harvest tax which is 161
dollars a pound and so if you're an indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: grower you might be asking somewhere
around you know 1500 dollars to 2000
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars per pound and you know it's the
same exact you know you might have three
[SPEAKER_05]: percent terpenes and you might have you
know 25 thc let's just say and then
[SPEAKER_05]: another farmer is producing cannabis
outdoors that also has three percent
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes and 25 thc but they're only
getting offered you know 500 dollars a
[SPEAKER_05]: pound but they're both getting taxed 161
dollars no matter what for that pound that
[SPEAKER_05]: is so that works out like if basically the
state is taxing indoor farmers at eight
[SPEAKER_05]: percent and taxing the sun-grown farmers
at 32 percent and so to me I'm just like
[SPEAKER_05]: that's so bizarre in a state like
California that's supposed to be you know
[SPEAKER_05]: green minded and and so on and so forth
that that there wouldn't be any kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: thought given to to the effect that that's
having because you know if you're a smart
[SPEAKER_05]: business person and you want to open up a
cannabis business it doesn't take a genius
[SPEAKER_05]: to know that like you know right now at
least it doesn't look like opening a a
[SPEAKER_05]: small farm in in the emerald triangle is a
good idea because it's like right
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's just saying like shit times
are tough and they shouldn't be because
[SPEAKER_05]: the freaking bud is just as good I mean
these guys came in here with some blood
[SPEAKER_05]: yesterday and to me it looks honestly it
looks better than most of the indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: flower that I've seen on the shelves in
the stores and I was just like oh my god
[SPEAKER_05]: like you can hardly there's really I mean
that's so frosty and just this is a one
[SPEAKER_05]: straw organics or otherwise known as burrs
place and that's the the hella jelly
[SPEAKER_02]: string these guys are great I just had to
change my batteries on my little board
[SPEAKER_05]: here I know I just I talked so much I got
my my crew is sitting here telling me all
[SPEAKER_05]: right there's stuff happening we gotta
deal with but okay I got one last little
[SPEAKER_02]: thing so the current status of measure s
and what Humboldt County supervisors did
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring temporary relief to the farms up
there yeah we really appreciate that I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean and and that's like humble looking
out for humble so they got rid of 85% of
[SPEAKER_05]: the excise tax is that what it is and 85%
of the cultivation tax we call it here it
[SPEAKER_05]: was always based on your square footage so
if you have you know if you have ten
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand square feet you owed ten thousand
dollars a year and if you have twenty
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand you owe twenty thousand actually
though if you have like a mix light it was
[SPEAKER_05]: more so there were different levels that
you could have but yeah they essentially
[SPEAKER_05]: now if you have ten thousand square feet
you only owe fifteen hundred dollars yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: so I mean that was great and and I think
it's humble kind of seeing that it needs
[SPEAKER_05]: to invest and support this industry if
it's gonna capture the long-term benefits
[SPEAKER_05]: of it and I think as we see federal
legalization happen and as we see people
[SPEAKER_05]: getting getting educated like the
consumers becoming more educated and not
[SPEAKER_05]: you know just sort of basing their their
decisions off of you know misinformation
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of that that it will be better for
places like humble Mendocino Trinity
[SPEAKER_05]: mm-hmm the cradle of American cannabis so
to speak but for the time being the cards
[SPEAKER_05]: are kind of stacked against us a little
bit or against this community up here
[SPEAKER_02]: which is mm-hmm well we're all praying for
the community yeah I mean you know people
[SPEAKER_05]: are it's people we've seen it we've been
watching it coming so you know the smart
[SPEAKER_05]: folks are have but the problem was is that
like the bar to get into the the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: race was so high I mean a lot of people
just spent their entire life savings
[SPEAKER_05]: because what happened was you know it
looked simple the applications for
[SPEAKER_05]: licenses were you know but then you you
started talking to these other agencies
[SPEAKER_05]: that you had to get approval from like you
know some of the environmental stuff was
[SPEAKER_05]: just like oh I've been an environmentalist
my whole life but I'll just be the first
[SPEAKER_05]: to admit that some of it was just over the
top and it like certainly I know Humboldt
[SPEAKER_05]: for example is the strictest environmental
laws for any agriculture in the world so
[SPEAKER_05]: it's harder to get a permit to grow
cannabis in Humboldt County than it is to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow anything anywhere in the world and
well maybe that's the way it should be but
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's kind of ironic when you know it's
it's there's not any kind of environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: well there's very little environmental
review if you're trying to open up a
[SPEAKER_05]: massive indoor operation in a warehouse
and it's just like well what's the what's
[SPEAKER_05]: the impact really on humanity yeah like
there may be some impact in like a small
[SPEAKER_05]: forest ecosystem way way out in the middle
of nowhere but you know a lot of these
[SPEAKER_05]: places it's just like there's logging and
mining happening all around it yeah it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: bit of an equity there and yeah and and
just yeah the the fact that you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: sun grown is kind of having the most
environmental oversight compared to you
[SPEAKER_02]: know indoor and and stuff like that mm-hmm
which leaves a much bigger carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint as well well yeah I want to
thank you very much for talking to Kelly
[SPEAKER_02]: Hyde today yeah buddy and we went a little
bit longer than we planned but there's

year okay I'll grow them I'll keep the
[SPEAKER_05]: story going all right after well we should
