[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody Chad Westport here to give
you an update on the video I made a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago about with my new space whether
I should go organic or stay with what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing and I've been having success
with I've got to say thank you everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who commented you guys and girls gave me a
lot of awesome information a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different approaches and actually saw some
of the questions that I had so it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful I know that had probably the most
comments on the future cannabis project
[SPEAKER_00]: channel ever so again thank you everybody
for your help and your support I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to delay this anymore let me I'll
explain but let's let's see what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: doing or what I'm not doing so let me open
the tent and we'll get right to it
[SPEAKER_00]: all right before the big reveal I also
want to say that I've been getting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of questions about this spider farmer se
5000 light people are eager to know how's
[SPEAKER_00]: it going for me what's it growing like I
don't know yet but the good news is this
[SPEAKER_00]: grow will be fully documented you'll be
able to see what the spider farmer se 5000
[SPEAKER_00]: light is doing for me let's reveal my
decision
[SPEAKER_00]: all right so the hippies won but I've got
a long hair and a beard so you really
[SPEAKER_00]: should have seen that one coming and I
actually did kind of change the plans and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this was based on the comments
that I got in the previous video so again
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you as you can see I've got two
different soil blends so I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: with the bed instead I've got some seven
gallon pots that I'm gonna rock these two
[SPEAKER_00]: soils in now this so hum living soil is a
water only mix so is this kiss organics
[SPEAKER_00]: mix some people have pooped the thought of
water only bagged soil that's why we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna put it to the test and one thing to
consider too is I'm not gonna be growing
[SPEAKER_00]: production sized plants I am growing what
the average home grower is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing so we'll keep that in mind along
the way and see exactly how far these are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get us you can catch updates here on
the SCP 02 channel on the perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: imperfect grow show I'll be doing a
monthly update there as well as more
[SPEAKER_00]: updates on my YouTube channel it's Chad
Westport I'm also gonna be doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown of the ingredients and all of
that for each of these bags so head over
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Chad Westport channel get more
information about this oil but I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to let you all know hopefully
you're dancing in the streets Kumbaya I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: giving up the bottles for this run and who
knows if I'm impressed it may stay like
[SPEAKER_00]: that so I guess in the words of Nate Diaz
I'm not surprised mother party on I go home
