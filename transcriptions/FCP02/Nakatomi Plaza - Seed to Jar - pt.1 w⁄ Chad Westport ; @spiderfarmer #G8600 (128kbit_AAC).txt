Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I just germinated my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 10 out of 10 on the Nakatomi plazas
to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm doing is I'm taking them and
I'm putting them into some Royal Gold
[SPEAKER_00]: Kings Blend mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not super hot so it's not going to
burn these fresh seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is going to give them a little bit
of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to start them out in these
little 4 inch containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just loading everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my tags so I can mark them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got my tweezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like handling them with tweezers instead
of my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit easier to pick them up
and then put them into the soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my measuring cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting them off with about 50
milliliters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the beginning of their
journey for the Nakatomi plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put one in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start, get my tag, take this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on number 5 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are number 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Booyah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put this into my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to make a little divot with
my pinky for the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to go deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the general rule of thumb is so
just about the width of the seed is how
[SPEAKER_00]: deep you want to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That applies to almost any seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing cannabis seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take it about a quarter of
an inch down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now see what I did is I grabbed it in my
little tweezers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're putting that white tip down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting the shell head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it's going to want to grow
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am gently covering it here with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back with my 50 milliliters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start off just kind of around
where I place the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to go right on top of
where I place my seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not watering the whole thing at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only 50 milliliters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting the area right around the
seed nice and wet to keep it germinating
[SPEAKER_00]: and to keep it growing its tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to suffocate it, but I also
don't want it to be too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep my eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking back in with the Nakatomi Plaza
10 test beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day 9 now of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, they're still
numbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it looks like number 2 might
have the most growth as far as leaf spread
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you look down here, you know,
you got number 8 and you got number 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those look like the tall ones of the
bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is going pretty good,
pretty much on the same pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 9, though, number 9 is the runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how the Nakatomi Plaza seeds
are looking on day 9, day 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the Nakatomi plazas are
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still got some that are taller than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're about to transplant them
into one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to soak up some of this
space, you know, from the soil up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: first cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these will actually look a bit shorter
here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, they're all fairly
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: 9 is still kind of the runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 and 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 are pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 2 is looking nice and squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how things are looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 15 on the Nakatomi plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: About to give them some water and put them
into their one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are checking in with the Nakatomi
plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day 29.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to see some similarities of
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go in for a closer look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's take a look from above and you
can kind of see here everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me turn on my auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are in one gallon containers in
the Sohum living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, 29 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been sitting under these,
the Spider Farmer F1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100 watt light, 100 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only at 60 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, it's, you know,
well above the actual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, plants don't need as much
light and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving them a little less light is kind of
a way to control the speed of their growth
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing that a little just
trying to juggle things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all know about rotation, but things are
getting freed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might up pot these soon, but I also
might keep these in the one gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, this is a Nakatomi plazas day
29.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chad Westport here with another update on
the Nakatomi plaza tester group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put 10 seeds in and I've got 10 growing
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kind of take a real quick panoramic
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stacks, you know, too deep here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five per row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go in for a closer look though at
this Nakatomi plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a good aerial view of the
Nakatomi plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're at about eighth or ninth node.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already starting to see what will be
the determining factor for sex on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got one female in there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another week, they'll reveal itself more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, you know, they're
fairly uniform as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: height goes, morphology and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are a little bit tighter on the inner
node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are a little bit looser, but again,
relatively all the same height,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is helpful in the garden when you're
planting a whole bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things that I wanted to point out
though, as far as the question of,
[SPEAKER_00]: did you see anything different or funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get a dragon leaf though,
a dragon's tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right here where it just
split into two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flip it over to the backside and again,
you just see, you know, it's again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that the dragon tongue leaf,
but dragon tongue leaf on one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this leaf, you kind of see how the
other half of it didn't really form here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little mutant leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is the only leaf on this
plant like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these genetic type of things,
they just happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not very worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly common actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant number nine, which was the runt
from the beginning, it's totally caught up
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of the other plants and it's
actually sitting a little bit lower in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks maybe an inch or two shorter,
but there's less soil in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's the same height as
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the runt fully caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do now is I'm just
going to go in and defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to remove all of these large fan
leaves because I want light getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches stretching below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, because this is just a grow
out, it's a test grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how it grows for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or well, I want you guys to see how it
grows naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do any training or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little light defoliation and let
the plant do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody, Chad Westport here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're checking back in with the Nakatomi
Plaza test grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got back from a week in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants look fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so as you can see here, haggard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think after the month in the
Netherlands and losing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really didn't think the person
watching the place could do this in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: week's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, after Netherlands, I had bought the
auto pot, so I wouldn't have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about things like this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but I also didn't have these
plants mature enough to be in the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: pots yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was still a hand watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go in for a closer look at the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to show you something
interesting about how I've noticed these
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies are actually probably lock
out because of fricking bad watering
[SPEAKER_00]: practices has shown up on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, a general look over all of the
plants real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't
don't don't don't don't don't don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No vacations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my interesting observation is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this side, which is under the
light, looks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fuck, it is haggard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I swore there, but it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's haggard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the other side of the
plant, actually, let me just quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the side that's under the
light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the side that's under the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the side that is away from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking pretty green, like you
don't have any of the same damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually kind of look healthy,
but the side that was under the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the deficiencies or the lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the light that is causing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the photosynthesis process of the
extra light that's causing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it potentially the extra transpiration
from these leaves drawing in more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or if it's locked out lack of
because it's photosynthesizing more than
[SPEAKER_00]: the side that was over here in the kind of
the shaded area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is one half of the plant looking so
haggard and the other half of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: looking good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inquiring minds want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to show that these are repeatable
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, this one under the light
in the corner, the side that's not in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it looks nice and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's go to this next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, haggard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, boy, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I was in Mexico, that showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's directly under the light there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if I flip to the back side,
the kind of the shadowy side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sides that were under the light
haggard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The side that was in the corner and not
getting the direct light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times that people start to see
little brown spots on their leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll think, oh, calcium, that's the
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of cases that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what we're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This do have brown spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually very advanced stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at likely is a
phosphorus deficiency and it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been locked out because of
overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how am I going to correct all these
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know this happened because too
much water in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also getting a little bit large
now for these one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to up
pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to kind of help the soil dry
out a little bit, kind of find an
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium with its new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to bring in some more oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I should be able to get proper
watering back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to defoliate the large fan
leafs, the ones that are looking haggard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even the green ones,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hold off.
[SPEAKER_00]: On doing some cutting of the lower
branches just because I want this to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through the stress it's currently under.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to get through the transplant
and I want it to handle the defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not going to toss too much at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as somebody who's testing genetics,
this is a great but unintended test of
[SPEAKER_00]: their solidness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, you can thank the person who were
watching these while I was gone in Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: for this unintended torture test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you, everybody, for following
along with this Nakatomi Plaza grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find more of me on the website,
ChadWestport.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there at Chad.Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, right here on YouTube,
Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you continue to follow this grow
out of the Nakatomi Plaza and they should
[SPEAKER_00]: be available already, if not very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Daga.Garden website.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, party on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three.
