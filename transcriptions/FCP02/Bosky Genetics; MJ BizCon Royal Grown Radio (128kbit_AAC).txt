[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, welcome back once again to Royal
Grown Radio, again, live from MJ BizCon
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021 podcast row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Michael Beck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Rick Elliott.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are joined by some longtime friends
and collaborators in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian and Jeremy from Boski Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Longtime Royal Gold user, man,
since day one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the first time I think was you
called into the office.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we and we spoke for a while and I was
just planning a trip down to the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it worked out perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We met up, been friends ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We winded up actually finding out and
realizing that we had mutual friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon with matches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also went to school with our fucking good
friend, Oli.
[SPEAKER_01]: All together, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The serendipity that we talk about,
the industry, you know, the big web,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get up and see him again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: See him all the time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell him I said what's up, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best friends with a cartoon character.
[SPEAKER_03]: He even comes with a cardboard cutout,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've woken up in that spare bedroom before
with that cardboard life size,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say cardboard cutout of Oli.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting when you wake up a
little shaky, don't know exactly where you
[SPEAKER_03]: are, where you went to sleep before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you wake up with that thing next to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganja Claus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now you're in with the Grow Off
competition, which is pretty amazing,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been seeing all your Instagram posts
over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're definitely getting better and
better every single year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shit you guys are producing,
just straight fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you've got jars in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already dipping in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entry right here, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take our samples next week to find out
what it comes in at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're excited to find out what the
strain is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember going and visiting you last
year's competition, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys were ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had already harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little snafu with that one,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We jumped the gun on getting it out there
before the competition was over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a little jar that let our
customers chime in and guess what the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain was, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was stoked to participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the coolest things about the
Grow Off is this mystery genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting a genetic that's kind of new
to market hasn't really blown up yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting access to that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love a lot about the Grow Off
competition, the data analytics,
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind of actual scientific data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, for me, the coolest thing is,
what strain is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first that I've actually seen
finished flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at Talking Trees Farms and seeing
the plants live on the vine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the smell was like sweet papaya punchy
kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it had a little bit of dirty,
acrid putridity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled like burnout, tire burnout or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putrid tire burnout.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's crazy to see all the different
growers, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, both indoor, outdoor, the
techniques, the nutrients that everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: use, lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everything affects the way that
this flower turns out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's neat, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, as a company that we sponsor
every year, we've been on four or five
[SPEAKER_03]: years now, and for many of those years,
I've had the honor and privilege to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: a ton of these contestants' farms and
facilities and see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is really fascinating to see the
differences on how they're being
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's really different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you get there and I'm like,
wow, this looks like a completely
[SPEAKER_03]: different strain in some ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has their own method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has their own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of input from the
industry and a lot of nutrients that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can use and a lot of lighting we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what ultimately it comes down to is
being comfortable with what you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and loving what you're doing and being
happy when you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a true success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely people are in it for the
business and for the financials of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: the gain that they believe is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people that are true to that,
I think, are going to be more successful
[SPEAKER_00]: because this makes me feel like I'm a kid
again, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The excitement is like opening up presents
on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the joy for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every strain is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what sort of strains are you working
on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are obviously breeding,
doing all sorts of genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that's popping out to you right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the avenue that you want to see
genetics steer towards?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that dominant force in the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, most of the stuff that I've
played with in the past is all OG
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Cookie Land, that's got the Forum
Cookies, Candy Land, and Dosido and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's heavy OG influence on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Finos we're finding, I mean,
I'm finding a lot of gas, a lot of cookie
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like it all, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a seed hoarder a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were kind of going through a few of
these Finos earlier at the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were showing us some of this amazing
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just love getting into that Fino
hunt type of mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh, I can taste the candy
land here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's, you know, this is OG boss.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG cut through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's winning the battle here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you had, what was it,
the five, I think you said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the number five is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me is the powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll stop you mid-joint and make you
think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were smelling it on the floor,
I'm like, I can't pinpoint it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some OG notes and there's some
sweeter notes, but it's really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I still have crosses with the old
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got train wreck for Brian,
you know, in one of the matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that got incorporated into some of the
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, we found some crazy Finos
in that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Batman, the train wreck is a staple of
my youth in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've held that strain longer than any
strain I've had throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I held it for over 15 years,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it occasionally in outdoor farms up
in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think last year I went to two different
farms up in Alder Point, and they were
[SPEAKER_03]: running some train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's something that happens when
you're about 25 feet away from that road,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're like, oh, damn, I just got
like the whole deja vu thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's done right, man, it's still one of
my all time favorite smokers, man.
I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite turk profiles,
but also one of my favorite smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way it tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Day time, day time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The feel, it's clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think we're going to see it brought
back into a lot of breeding programs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already some companies that are
using it and working with it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: has a lot of traits that benefit different
kinds of strains you can mix with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think you'll see in the future train
wrecks start to come into breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs and start coming back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a lot of influence from
the newer genetics, so it's nice to mix
[SPEAKER_01]: the old with the new and have that ability
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I love that you mentioned that new
school genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked with my old man about this,
and he's back in Michigan and does this
[SPEAKER_02]: little tiny medical thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got old school strands,
and I'm like, check out the new school
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a difference here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a new strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new type of genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't seeing these cookies gelato
type nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud structure, the way that they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything out there that I'm seeing,
hats off to all the breeders that are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys that are really like Humble Seed
Company, for instance, those guys put a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of love into this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of seeds that they're
planting and the farms that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with and building that network is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had them on Royal Grown Radio the
beginning of season two, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were talking about some of those
phenol hunts, 10,000, 20,000 plant phenol
[SPEAKER_03]: hunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nat, obviously, has been in the game and
doing this for a while, super passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then his daughter, Allie, is just
amazing, just super brilliant,
[SPEAKER_03]: and just right there in her dad's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told him that he's doing God's work,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's one similarity I see is the
passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what really spoke to me about what
Nat and Howie do is that they mean it with
[SPEAKER_02]: every fiber of their being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing I've seen from you
guys from the get go, too, is you're
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to blow people's minds and you
want to make yourselves proud of what you
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what separates any truly
successful business or process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the plant first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the that's what's carried
us through the last 20 plus years of our
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean that if we take the focus away
from that, then nothing nothing works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at the other side of it,
the money and all of that, that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong thing to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that we talk about quite a bit
on this on this program is that the hustle
[SPEAKER_03]: with integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, coined by fat bowl
clothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a big shout out to Brian Swislow
for that one, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can't stop saying that and bringing
that back up in the conversations,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that is something that attracts
all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that hustle with integrity,
keeping keeping your good intentions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when we're driving the direction
of this plant, you know, going forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to dodge the the ill
intentions, you know, because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of them out there always is going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you focus on trying to be great at
your craft, no matter what your craft is,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's cannabis, painting your music
or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to truly be great at your
craft, that attracts people, which in
[SPEAKER_00]: which in turn will attract the financial
that people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you should focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a byproduct, that's what you're trying
to do and accomplish and be better at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and make that better and truly enjoy what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and all that will come later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people are successful
chasing the dollar in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They figure out their path or their brand
or whatever they do that makes them
[SPEAKER_00]: successful and makes them money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but just for us, we just try to
focus on, you know, perfecting our craft
[SPEAKER_00]: and staying genuine as cultivators and
trying to really, you know, dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: staying true to a legacy grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bringing science into it and being
able to bridge the gap between both and be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to communicate in both worlds,
you know, and and be successful at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to do a large grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to blow things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're trying to be a small,
you know, team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing to have the access that we
have now to technology and what we can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually bring into the equation,
you know, to assist with the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's got a lot more data today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was it was difficult to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the data is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Data driven was hanging out at the local
hydro store and the owners bring it for an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour when there was no search and search
and overgrow compared to forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as far as from family members or
especially multiple generation growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, uncles or parents that
have grown in their life and passed on
[SPEAKER_00]: stories that we've set around as kids
listening to, you know, as they smoked or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, told us about the plan or
different methods that I still believe in,
[SPEAKER_00]: as in like the old hippie style method
compared to a scientific method,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think you got to stay genuine to
the passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to really understand,
you know, where this originated at and
[SPEAKER_00]: started and got to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a lot of old stories from family
members and picking up the cues,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, seeing the cues in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, that's really what
dictates what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the data is great to be able to
put a number to, you know, what we've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: for all these years, you know,
and that's that's really the awesome part
[SPEAKER_01]: of it is correlate the numbers with,
you know, the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: That passion fuels the quest for data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you like you're like, this is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get a soil sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's send it to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's check the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's tissues every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd send nutrient samples every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was kind of our routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran well water with the last grow we
were at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a moving target.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were always chasing, you know,
what was going on with the chemistry in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it was it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a major learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it definitely brought out the
best in us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps refine you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it makes you better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you approach it in a positive sense
of trying to better and learn and
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beat that, then it just makes you
better at what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you know it, especially growing
your whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal is eliminate variables,
you know, and make it as easy as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can be happy and successful at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fought it the whole time,
it's you're stressed out, you burn out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tired, you question what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's eliminate those variables,
you know, and learn, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do so that you don't have those
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the beginning and prepare,
you know, so that you don't have those
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, especially the right
environment and a dialed in environment
[SPEAKER_00]: really gives different strains,
you know, opportunity to thrive and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people will discard different
strains because they didn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do well, but they didn't have their
environment dialed or they had other
[SPEAKER_00]: issues or spikes or, you know,
water issues or different issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and they would ultimately go to the
strain and kind of put that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, some strains don't get them
be able to live and be able to show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first, this is the second plant I
grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one was, I didn't have the same
results, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dried in the back seat of the car on
the way over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so incredibly fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lost a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll smell it, you know, in the end,
you know, but it is, it's fruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost like a minty fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love what you're saying about data and
testing and testing your well water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something we're focusing more
on too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just brought in a soil lab called
Imperial Analytics so that we can have
[SPEAKER_02]: soil samples sent to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can test them, process it and send you
your fertility back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually compare that with your
sap testing and be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: my soil's got this, but my plant's missing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's my uptake issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I've got way too much K in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wasting money dumping all this extra
fertilizer in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to help kind of feed that
knowledge quest and kind of data fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we take 50 leaf samples per zone
off nine flower zones plus three of edge
[SPEAKER_00]: zones a week, plus a well water sample,
ABC, plus a mixed sample and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed together and in a runoff sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we compare what was in our
plants, configure runoffs and adjust a mix
[SPEAKER_00]: that Ryan developed for the last couple of
years and adjust that mix to benefit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always had adjustments to make with
that, you know, and it's... RO is
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously different, you know,
that's obviously beneficial because you
[SPEAKER_00]: strip all the elements out and start with
the blank canvas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, I mean, for a crop that's this
valuable, you know, in the grow that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: building, I'm going on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're not going to, you know,
deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eliminate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we live, especially we're surrounded
by agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as I say, your water is definitely
a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had changes where nitrates have
changed overnight, where we've got,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot more buildup in nitrates,
more chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a struggle, you know,
different times of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our water is shallow, you know,
it's 120 feet deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's a lot more influenced by
what happens above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we adapted and we'll be able to
adjust and learn a lot of things and be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to grow plants with the
water that we're pumping out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like six or seven hundred parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was out there, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just reinforces that importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only testing your soil, testing your
sap, but test that irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another service we offer at
Imperial too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's coming out of the same lab
as your soil test, so you know your data
[SPEAKER_02]: is all poorly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they doing tissues as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not doing tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bigger nut to crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we brought the lab in,
we really wanted to focus on providing
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves the services that we needed and
a quick turnaround time for our testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: For our R&D and QC, it's 100% critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a line sample and we need to have
that information immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you as a grower, you're like,
I need this snapshot and I need it now
[SPEAKER_02]: before I do something else that changes
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're growing in
something like Rockwell, where you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of results fast, where you see a lot
of changes fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get results right away so you
can make those changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you try to catch those issues
way early on or you eliminate those issues
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning, like we were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of labs ship samples out,
so you're dealing with lead times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to ship it out and wait for a
third party to process it and send it back
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding the right lab is one of the key
factors in this, where you can get the
[SPEAKER_01]: results fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that our lab, where we live out,
would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because where we're at, the labs are
pretty far distance away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if more time, or even an in-house lab
eventually, something you can do just for
[SPEAKER_00]: your own testing, somebody that can do on
site, your own testing to keep on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we at Royal Gold, we're like,
we have to maintain this lab that the
[SPEAKER_02]: local people, Dirty Business Soil
Consulting, they were done with the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: moving on to their education and crop
consulting work and putting that first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, we need this for us,
but we need it for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to offer this service.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's vital.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about just bringing it internal
and not allowing people to submit samples
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, no, we need to provide
this for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really has come a long way really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up working in Ag Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for a soil laboratory for three
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I did was take soil samples,
petiole samples, leaf samples,
[SPEAKER_01]: and process data, and correlate that to
what we had to give the field to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: back to where it needed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up at a young age seeing that
and the importance of it in the field on a
[SPEAKER_01]: grand scale of tens of thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is no different than what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people on that level of ag,
they don't cut corners on that testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they do not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a core part of their program.
[SPEAKER_02]: That $100 test could save you $1,000 in
misapplied nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or millions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the other thing that's
really important is methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing the native soil here in Las Vegas
is a different process than testing a
[SPEAKER_02]: potting media, than testing a hybrid
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I think cultivators like
yourself, you know what's in that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all right, hey, I need a native
test on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not a lot of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a mineral soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, hey, this is all potting media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a potting media test because it's
different extractions to show you what's
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's already in the media before you
put your plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can test different levels of what,
you know, what you have in there exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which compounds or which
macronutrients you have in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's also important for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the quality of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not just financially,
but if you're trying to produce the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quality you can and do the best you can
and you want to check all those things and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make sure that you have all
that dialed in right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because when you set back and
you're done and there's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not happy with, you automatically
start thinking about all those little
[SPEAKER_00]: details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, man, I wish I would have done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, man, I wish I would have did this and
this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time what you do is you do
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years and over the different
grows and gardens that you put in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've slowly eliminated and changed and
adjusted to where you just automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: do all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's a little more,
it might cost a little more, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning you do those because in
the end you're going to have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: product and you're going to be happy with
what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you learn that over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just learn that, you know,
at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had to go to the car and finish
trimming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go show Matt next.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're on MJ Biz here in Las Vegas,
May 21.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to see everybody back here and,
you know, taking a couple years off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's nice to finally get to see
the familiar faces and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: been in the industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've known you for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rick, to get to hang with you guys
anytime, you know, we're around is always
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate you coming here and doing
this with us, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the hot new thing we should be
looking for from you guys out there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world?
[SPEAKER_02]: People out at home, checking this out,
listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What seeds are going to be the hot fresh
thing to keep an eye for the drop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Cookie Land is the one I'm focusing on
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the F3s are getting ready
to come next.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was the F2 that Jeremy has
in here, but the Cookie Land and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses that we've made with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grow is getting built as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping, you know, May of next
year is kind of our ETA of being
[SPEAKER_01]: operational and then just, you know,
watch our social media and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stay tuned to see what we end up doing
there because it's going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can people find you online?
[SPEAKER_01]: At Boski Genetics is my main account.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be, you know, for the Grow,
Boski Cannabis and Boski Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do consulting as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's the other side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, we're fixing to come online and we
want people to be aware that we're coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out to do the best we can and the best we
can put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so be ready and because we're going to
do our job to make sure we provide clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, good cannabis for people,
you know, and multiple different flavors,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, you know, bring genetics to the
forefront, you know, and keep on working
[SPEAKER_00]: on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot more than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just my main focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point of the spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the point of the spirit,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loving what I'm seeing with the
phenols that we've already pulled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, make green bud great again,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're all about that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, the purple just took over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like all the colors, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if you grow the right strains
and you get the right, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the look and a lot of frost and the right
smell and the turpentine, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people can't deny it, you know,
even if it's green or purple, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you open it, you're a true connoisseur,
a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people are going to, you know,
at least try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get the good flavor and a
good clean burn and you get that good XL
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, you know, and it just,
you know, all the things that happen when
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke a flower, you know, it's
undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that as long as we put out a
good brand, a good quality flower that is
[SPEAKER_00]: truly quality all around, not just bag of
pill, but also a nose to it, also flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a great XL, a great high to it,
clean high to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of people are going to
come on board with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as we do our job and make
sure that we're doing a good job when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in our garden and making sure that
we're carrying ourselves correctly and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the right things that we should do
in our garden and trying to put all those
[SPEAKER_00]: years of experience into that and are
disciplined in what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it will just all come with
it, you know, as people who learn about it
[SPEAKER_00]: and start smoking our flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it will definitely grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a good friend of ours says,
the proof is in the puffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we come from, I worked at a
hydra store for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan owned a hydra store for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been doing this for a lot
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We come from that, that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all know that a lot of people say
that they do this or they produce that or
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody produces fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tell everybody, put it on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put it on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no problem putting it on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody else can put it on the
table, and it's not that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cocky or a competition or that,
but we're confident in the way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: carry ourselves and what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you guys so much for coming
and sharing this passion with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been impressed by what you
guys are bringing to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait to see the final fruits
of this Candyland mash up project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, that was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
