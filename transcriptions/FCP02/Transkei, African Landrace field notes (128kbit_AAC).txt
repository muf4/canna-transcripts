[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, field notes again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already started covering the transki.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed you another phenote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at the other side of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from our African sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is October 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you up close here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is actually, in my opinion,
it's very close to being ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to come in close on some of
these buds, see what the final bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably can go for a few more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just very, very crystal-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're tiny, tiny, tiny, teensy
little, almost like pixie dust trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at it, at first you're
like, where's the crystal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look closer and you're like,
oh, it's totally crystal-coated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're just tiny little trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's like, it's piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also like a fresh parsnip.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of parsley and dill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very savory herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also there's kind of a thicker,
creamier, almost like chocolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like chocolate mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also with like parsley and fresh
parsnip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an astringent thing going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the furthest thing from fruity,
tooty, modern cannabis flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very savory herb, piney,
astringent, with a little chocolatey
[SPEAKER_00]: yumminess in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be harvesting this this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is transki.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one.
Thank you.
Thank you.
