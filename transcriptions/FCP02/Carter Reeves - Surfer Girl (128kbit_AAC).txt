we're so stoked Carter how are you buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude I'm doing great Thanks for having me
Appreciate it Thanks for coming down So
[SPEAKER_02]: why don't you tell our listeners a little
bit about it yourself Where to begin?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know man I grew up in New England
I grew up listening to really great music
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts Yeah I grew up outside of
Boston about 20 minutes west So suburban
[SPEAKER_02]: boy through and through But I always grew
up I grew up spending my summers with my
[SPEAKER_02]: parents up in Maine And so that's kind of
where I first got connected to that beach
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle And just kind of you know kicked
back on the beach and kind of went oh my
[SPEAKER_02]: goodness How could I do this all day every
day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And so you know that's kind of
synonymous with the music Absolutely And
[SPEAKER_02]: the surfing and you know this kind of like
easy breezy feel good stuff you know Yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: I never grew up listening to anything too
hardcore I definitely went through my kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of emo phase for a little bit But it was
always something feel good Yeah So I think
[SPEAKER_02]: being from New England like definitely
helped to kind of set me on this path of
[SPEAKER_06]: making the music that I'm making now Yeah
well it's very cool I'm glad you're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: it Yeah So when did you start playing
singing and writing tunes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been a weird little bit of a
roller coaster of a journey because I
[SPEAKER_02]: never was classically trained on anything
I never actually really properly took
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons still to this day for anything
Tried and failed a few times but I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know I always grew up just making mouth
noises Just freaking being a noise And
[SPEAKER_02]: bababooing around the house and just
singing and yeah Finally my mom was that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know she pulled me aside and she was
just like yo I love you, but you're very
[SPEAKER_02]: annoying You need to transfer this into
some sort of something So she signed me up
[SPEAKER_02]: for chorus if I like like you know just
like my middle school chorus Yep,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I hated so much It was just it was
too bland and all this you're learning all
[SPEAKER_02]: the the keys and the tenors and the
sopranos Again, it was too rigid for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but um that was about the first kind of
step seriously into music was I think
[SPEAKER_06]: sixth grade Yeah, sweet So sixth grade and
you were taking choral?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I and again you know it's just
too rigid for me and and but but it
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely got my ears going and my you
know my voice going and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: where I grew my singing voice And I had
played a little bit of piano in the past
[SPEAKER_02]: but again never really took anything too
seriously it wasn't until Freshman year of
[SPEAKER_02]: high school my best friends put together a
four-piece rock band literally in in my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend's garage We listened to the red hot
chili peppers religiously, dude We wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to be we wanted to be them so badly all
you had to do is get four socks But it was
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy yeah, I mean so we just For a bunch
of ragtag Freshman sophomores and in high
[SPEAKER_02]: school we took it damn seriously Yeah,
you know we would practice for like five
[SPEAKER_02]: hours a day after school every single day
and whose garage David von Meringue Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: shout out to David and shout out to
David's mom more importantly because she
[SPEAKER_02]: would just let us rock Yeah, my mom had to
put up with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah It's just yeah, it's relentless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't suck that much So like at least
it was palatable to here, but like oh my
[SPEAKER_02]: gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, but uh That was what started
the whole thing and and and that band That
[SPEAKER_02]: rock band in high school, you know,
it was the first time I had ever taken
[SPEAKER_02]: music seriously writing a bunch of music
and writing lyrics and Trying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of fun doing it and that that
band was actually the start of Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: cuz there's a four piece band and then two
of us kind of split off You know once once
[SPEAKER_02]: to make air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so David von Meringue was the
drummer of our band and he was Always he
[SPEAKER_02]: always had ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was always spinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, you know, hey play this on
the guitar Hey write the music like this
[SPEAKER_02]: or like hey, let's try this and try all
these ideas and it's like dude We just
[SPEAKER_02]: thought you were the drummer But here he
is like with all these genius ideas and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's kind of starting to come out of his
skin a little bit yeah, and You know the
[SPEAKER_02]: band didn't end up seeing eye to eye
Especially cuz kind of college was coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up around the corner and we were ready to
just go all in on this band Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, that's that's not
everybody's path in life, so David and I
[SPEAKER_02]: split off and we did our own thing and
that's where it came from So well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a natural kind of progression.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh Who are your musical influences
besides the chili peppers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hate these guys with all my heart
I was figuring you had some old-school
[SPEAKER_02]: influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am I mean admittedly, you know,
I'll be honest, you know, I grew up with
[SPEAKER_02]: music in the house So yeah, you know,
I was always familiar with the Beatles
[SPEAKER_02]: always familiar with the Stones and the
Beach Boys and and everybody but It wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not until you as an adult or you as a
listener you decide I'm gonna go back and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna listen to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't until maybe five or six years
ago that I actually went from like 50s all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way up to like, you know the 80s and
just like listen to every album of All the
[SPEAKER_02]: greats everybody knows the names,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like do you ever actually sit down and
listen?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the catalog and so finally I did But
influences, I mean, it's got to be got to
[SPEAKER_02]: be the Beatles got to be the Beach Boys I
love this new funky group out of Houston
[SPEAKER_02]: called Krong been Yeah, it means airplane
in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're super at which you know,
we can't get enough of today obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're super rad and they kind of
like you know, I started to get into kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of this the intersection of like
psychedelic Gallia retro vibes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also just kind of like, you know
groovy Groovy like surf rock and so like
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of whole world really kind of
stuck out to me And moving to California,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah driving driving on PCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just What better music than than that
kind of feel good feel good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But um, I Mean Kid Cudi shaped me Jack
Johnson shaped me sublime, of course
[SPEAKER_02]: Slightly stupid big-time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a dirty heads fan when I was 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know These are the guys that
that that shaped, you know my sound now
[SPEAKER_02]: and my style now I'd say I've just spent
maybe the past ten years honing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah guitar influence Mark Spear
lead of lead lead guitarist of Krong been
[SPEAKER_02]: he's uh He just has a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really have a conversation Have
a lead vocalist, you know now they're kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of trying to do vocals, but they don't
have a lead vocalist His guitars the lead
[SPEAKER_02]: vocal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just hear it you hear this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear these melodies and yeah shit I'm
nowhere near being able to play like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that that showed me a whole new style
and and also opened me up into like
[SPEAKER_02]: Vietnamese rock 60s Arabian funk like all
this crazy music that I never thought I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: listen to I'll have to play you my old
band.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope Tied background singers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not here to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so I can't but Him and then of
course him from a lead standpoint and then
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, you know, the Beatles just
Continually blow my mind with their chord
[SPEAKER_02]: progressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, their chord change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god How do you get from here to
there and how do you do it so smoothly?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know so I'll sit down I'll try and study
those, you know, they've been a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: influence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Beatles are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little hard to fit in all those C
major 7 to Dominant fifth with a minor 9th
[SPEAKER_02]: all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little hard to fit that into like a
reggae groove, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we record a little too over
complicated, but you know, the Beatles
[SPEAKER_06]: chord changes were Yeah, no top and
comparable and same with Beach Boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean Brian Wilson He used to
study, you know Bach and he would study
[SPEAKER_02]: Mozart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's how he would make his
chord progressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like That's far out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Surfer Girl kind of a concept
Yeah, and who are they?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean you got a band, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know, so first and foremost that
you know, the name certainly comes from my
[SPEAKER_02]: love for the Beach Boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Surfer Girl is One of my favorite
songs by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Yeah, you could go for days on all
the songs I love by them But that one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that one stuck out to me when I
was young And that one has continually
[SPEAKER_02]: like stood up to the test of time for me
Moved to LA Fell in love with a longtime
[SPEAKER_02]: friend of mine who's from LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh We've been dating now for you know,
three years and she's kind of my surfer
[SPEAKER_02]: girl as well How cool and so between the
Beach Boys between the song and then
[SPEAKER_02]: between the fact that I think Well,
I see it in two ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see obviously Surfer Girl is just such a
beautiful concept You know, everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: loves this free-spirited badass woman who
just is out there walking on water I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an idol to little girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an idol to guys in the lineup surfing
alongside her She's just you know an idol
[SPEAKER_02]: and that to me is just always had this
really golden sunny beautiful Feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: around, you know, just that person and so
I thought it'd be really cool to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like nod and shout out all of those folks
and those women but and also at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time You know, I feel like 2022 is a fun
time and it's an interesting time in a
[SPEAKER_02]: place where I can be a male front man of a
band and put together a band called surfer
[SPEAKER_02]: girl and May confuse a few people they may
be expecting some hot blonde to come out
[SPEAKER_02]: on stage and they get me instead,
but you know, like I think it's a fun
[SPEAKER_02]: time, you know people I think are shedding
labels a little bit and having a good time
[SPEAKER_02]: and just it's about the vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah Yeah, yeah, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Was that first surfer girl EP
written during the pandemic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, it was a crossroads of a time
It was definitely an interesting period
[SPEAKER_02]: for the world and for everybody but
definitely for me personally Air had split
[SPEAKER_02]: up, you know five years prior The duo that
that kind of got my foot in the door
[SPEAKER_02]: musically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was struggling to do solo music for a
long time Because each song sounded
[SPEAKER_02]: different from the last yeah, which I kind
of prided myself in Right and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: priding myself in that and to me I was
kind of going through different styles to
[SPEAKER_02]: see what stuck with the audience But what
what felt authentic to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think it was hard to grasp
on to for a lot of fans but long story
[SPEAKER_02]: short, you know, I kind of got to a point
where financially I was looking at myself
[SPEAKER_02]: and I said, oh shit, maybe it's time to Do
what mom always says and get a real job
[SPEAKER_02]: and throw in the towel and not to say I
get pressure from my mother She's very
[SPEAKER_02]: supportive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah moms are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course, you know, just my best
interest Yeah, exactly looking at looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at the track record.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's mom's name Victoria?
[SPEAKER_06]: Victoria?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's wonderful But looking at the track
record and saying, you know, it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: five years trying to do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm You know, I got to get something
stable Yeah, or at least get something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's got some hope and and some kick
behind it Well surfer girl seems to be
[SPEAKER_06]: very promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's feeling good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean so The world stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I went back to the East Coast to lay
low with the family for a little bit Which
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very grateful to have been able to do
mm-hmm Was surfing every day through March
[SPEAKER_02]: April May, you know, it's snowing in
Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you are in the water and You know,
I had been brainstorming with some friends
[SPEAKER_02]: about you know, kind of Dude, you always
made this feel good Reggae kind of beachy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know modern modern kind of beach pop
feel good stuff Maybe it's time you you
[SPEAKER_02]: you try and do that because the Carter
Reef stuff I think I was trying to be
[SPEAKER_02]: something and then it was just like I like
the Carter Reef stuff Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh, well, so you know Pandemic hit it
was ready to throw in the towel or
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially and and and finally,
you know My buddy and I were just
[SPEAKER_02]: brainstorming on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like well, why don't you put together
a band?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you make that music that always
spoke to you in the first place?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just started writing songs making
demos producing them, you know on my
[SPEAKER_02]: laptop with my guitar and my bass and my
in the New England basement up in Maine
[SPEAKER_02]: and Had five great songs that I freaking
love and they're all hit dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you sent them off to ineffable
records Radio silence for six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding, but it was radio sound radio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a little disconcerting Well,
it was just like oh god.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this really nice body of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And somehow I got a call in August
from from Adam Adam gross shout out to
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam brother And he just called me and
he's like dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how this just came across my
desk, but I just heard the EP It's
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to support it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to put it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go right and that was the start
That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's nice to have a team behind you,
you know, I like ineffable records They
[SPEAKER_02]: have great artists cool and I love how
diverse the roster is I love how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: branching out like genre wise but also
Just like Yeah, they're they're doing it
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's a young guy and I it's really
Adam and Thomas man both young dudes and
[SPEAKER_06]: both just crushing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Speaking to that EP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about hero a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's Come out swinging and you know,
this this is this is a song that then
[SPEAKER_06]: endeared my son to you because it has some
political Ideas about who wasn't cool a
[SPEAKER_06]: few years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes Are we still looking for a hero?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean in the context of you know hero is
not a sugar-coated song by any means I
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrote that the president don't know shit
right and I said that loud and I said it
[SPEAKER_02]: proud and I still stand by it I stand by
that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think In time the funny thing was and so
like on YouTube I'll get so many Comments
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was written in what year it was
2017, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it was definitely a a for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a fuck Trump anthem Yeah,
I was pretty pissed off and fed up and to
[SPEAKER_02]: me I I Wholeheartedly believe that both
sides of the coin are Pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah real bad, you know, I yeah,
we're still in a bunch of hot water there
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh to me knows if we're ever gonna get out
of to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's personal freedoms It's
supporting people and it's and it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: equitable support for people who For years
generations our country was built on
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting some and not others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we just even the playing field?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and and that's kind of the message
of the song was just like yo this I Think
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a pointed fuck Trump anthem when it
came out but it's cool because it has
[SPEAKER_02]: lived on and and kind of grew a new
meaning to me which is you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody was Joe Biden was not my top
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was not in my top 15 of trusses.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why Maybe not my hero, but he's not
the hero.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not at all He is not and and so
it's funny because you make a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: statement like kind of like the president
don't know shit Fuck Trump kind of thing
[SPEAKER_02]: and now everybody comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's your buddy Biden doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, this was not my guy to begin with
right But what I will say is I'd rather
[SPEAKER_02]: have someone at least seems like fighting
for the right direction of humanity and
[SPEAKER_02]: the country and climate change then not
but with all that said The message of the
[SPEAKER_02]: songs kind of still still stands true
Yeah, and when I perform it live,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I kind of I kind of tweak the
lyrics a little bit from our president
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know shit to a president can't do
shit and like a president won't do shit or
[SPEAKER_02]: a president don't know shit like it to me
it is more about You can't rely on one
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah to solve all the world's problems and
treat everybody fairly and and and The
[SPEAKER_02]: system that we have the system is broken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's open our minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the system we do have is not
Built in a way that's gonna help everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: and listen to everybody's needs And so to
me this kind of overarching thing of like
[SPEAKER_02]: a president can't be the one to help you
You know, it starts from within you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: help yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to help your community You got to
start small like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know vote small You know try and get
someone you like in build a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: community grow some fucking food grow some
weed have a good time and Connect on that
[SPEAKER_02]: level and I think that's where it's gonna
start from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me the message is more become Don't
just cast a vote and rely on this person
[SPEAKER_02]: to fix everything It really does start
from within and it does start from
[SPEAKER_02]: connecting, you know on on the ground
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, bro So that's where it's at
still looking for a hero for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Definitely As I listen to your music,
I can't help but think What is your
[SPEAKER_06]: creative process because you know as a
songwriter?
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at other people's songs and I
really admire your songwriting process.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is your creative process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Been producing music for a long time
But I never felt confident that the music
[SPEAKER_02]: I was producing was good enough or you
know up to snuff until that EP and I kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of just like said f it let's take this
leap of faith, you know, we got the label
[SPEAKER_02]: behind us and That was the first full body
of work that I had kind of produced myself
[SPEAKER_02]: So the process now is you know,
just kind of sit down with a blank Slate
[SPEAKER_02]: be it on a computer in in logic Pro being
my my my blank slate Yeah, or just sit
[SPEAKER_02]: down with a guitar outside somewhere sit
down with a pad of paper I don't have one
[SPEAKER_02]: specific way in which it starts,
but once it's sparked I chase it down
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I like each your songs have like a
chorus a Bridge yeah and verses,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's there it's and each one of
them seems to have a hook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the formula isn't reinventing the
wheel by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like you were saying I mean They're
I believe these are pop songs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think they're really catchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty traditional song structures
You know, I'm not doing anything wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not reinventing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're genuine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I appreciate that cuz it contrived you
can still do an a B a B kind of song and
[SPEAKER_02]: and and Have it be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, you know and and have it be
catchy and not to bubblegum or not to to
[SPEAKER_02]: this or to that so I'm kind of happy with
the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you know, eventually I Would love
to kind of I'm having a lot more fun with
[SPEAKER_02]: just like instrumental breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let the people breathe I don't need
to be singing from minute one love those
[SPEAKER_02]: little and surf guitar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been having a lot more fun and
letting the soul speak a little more and
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of Going off a feel more so than
going off of like what I think is an
[SPEAKER_02]: impactful arrangement, you know,
just have a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Know this question probably should have
been Asked earlier, but how were you when
[SPEAKER_06]: you started air?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So like I was saying that you know,
it came out of a four-piece band,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was freshmen sophomore to junior year
of high school Yeah, we actually I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it was right before my 17th birthday When
we first put music out as air and you you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys had some success with that Yeah,
I mean I wouldn't be here now if it
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't for that hands down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah creatively, but also, you know being
able to Stand music full-time We were
[SPEAKER_02]: young it was senior year of high school
and this was like the golden age of
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube and Facebook and everything and
the music was just blowing up yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I remember one day going into the
principal's office and Requesting the
[SPEAKER_02]: principal for a weekend off or the Friday
going into a weekend off because we had
[SPEAKER_02]: just gotten booked at a frat in at
University of South Carolina Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so we go in fraternity party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And and and it was so funny because
he gave it he gave you the day off Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, and he was the type of guy who was
like god.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like this letting my students take
a day off to go Probably do a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of debauchery shit with a bunch of frat
bros in the south Sounds like a mess,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he was also the guy who was all about
Experience and learning from right going
[SPEAKER_02]: out and doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was just like yeah Yeah,
and he was he was he let us go and that
[SPEAKER_02]: was at the beginning of the end,
you know, we just from there on out it was
[SPEAKER_02]: just Graduated high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the road that June.
Yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have all that much except
my mind in my calendar clear I'm a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen in months and some I
haven't seen in years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'll say this more than once
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll still be getting stolen kicking back
on the low
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't anybody tell me that we about
to act A couple blocks in front of me But
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going back now to watch the
waves that be rolling with faces
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll still be getting stolen kicking back
on the low Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I'll still be getting stolen kicking
back on the low
[SPEAKER_06]: I Was gonna ask you about the transition
between air and surfer girl, but I think
[SPEAKER_06]: we kind of went over that Yeah,
so let me ask the next question Joyride
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of deals with reality and yet has a
little bit of an escapist vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, talk about your idea Yeah,
I mean, I'm trying to think you know That
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole EP was written at the same time
So, you know, the themes are somewhat
[SPEAKER_02]: similar throughout but it definitely Was
this you know, I had never felt more alive
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time because I was getting to be in
the water every day which you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even in California can be a little rare
but Every day in the water for like five
[SPEAKER_02]: hours a day and just never felt more and
creatively connected with the music and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would come out of the water and have a new
song idea in my head and just I never felt
[SPEAKER_02]: more You know at peace, but it was in this
juxtaposition of I Was also at a
[SPEAKER_02]: crossroads with myself not knowing
professionally where I wanted to go You
[SPEAKER_02]: know not exactly knowing what it was that
was making me happy at the time and this
[SPEAKER_02]: was like the whole world had shut down and
gone to shit it was a dark time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yet I was able to take a lot of right
Moments of peace through it all and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: almost kind of felt guilty about that but
then at the same time I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you should just get whatever
peace you can get and so Joyride always
[SPEAKER_02]: felt to me is like this song where I was
like You know, you're young you're lost
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of looking around but like,
you know, you're still the sun's still
[SPEAKER_02]: shining on your back Even if it's like,
you know, yeah, even if it's a dark time
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know You know, I'm still driving
the car, you know to and from the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still got the spliff in my mouth,
you know you Kind of given a little
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective that you know while you may be
all up in your head or times may be a
[SPEAKER_02]: little tough You know, there are those
little winds throughout that can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: keep you pushing and keep you moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a great song When I listen to
it, it reminds me of when I was young at
[SPEAKER_06]: the beach and that feeling you get of
freedom and it's a beautiful day and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like Yeah, forget it and but there's like
this almost there's this aggression behind
[SPEAKER_02]: it, too Which is like let's fucking hustle
and like it's time to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time You know be grateful
for what you got is yeah, I like doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that a little bit a little bright with the
dark Happy with the sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you'll always find kind of those
bittersweet vibes in my music for sure
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and if we're not going to the
studio, we're heading south to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah What do you like to surf around here
by the way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Well, I moved to California and had
never surfed a point break ever and I had
[SPEAKER_02]: never well I went to Sunset for my first
time which is on slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes long peeling wave Yeah, granted it is
crowded and it's kind of dirty,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I go to Sunset really all the time
because if it's hitting like three to four
[SPEAKER_02]: feet Yeah, easy waves longest ride I've
ever written and because I grew up on
[SPEAKER_02]: beach breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Malibu?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Malibu first points a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really friendly crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh You used to not be so friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean Topanga I've gotten yeah
pushed out the water a couple times but um
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I'm I can hold my own
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for a while there, you know,
I just wasn't Yeah, but now I know I know
[SPEAKER_02]: what the hell I'm doing I'm a solid surfer
and so it's like, you know, yep stay out
[SPEAKER_02]: of everybody's way Know the etiquette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all Yeah, sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful catch me at sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah a couple times a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have Solo material under Carter
Reeves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, super bloom is probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you kind of a whimsical psychedelic
team Let's talk about that a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well And I love the video by the way,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah That was all shot in Maine So that's
a crazy culmination because For a while
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to trick myself and tell
myself I'm gonna be in the band and put
[SPEAKER_02]: out surfer girl music But at the same time
I'm still gonna be putting out solo Carter
[SPEAKER_02]: Reeves music and we're gonna do both at
the same time and Everyone's gonna be so
[SPEAKER_02]: blown away by how cool that is that is
putting out secret Side projects and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be you can't be two artists at
once And so when I was writing writing the
[SPEAKER_02]: EP the the surfer girl EP that was also
when super bloom I wrote super bloom and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was also when I wrote Another song
called let it slide and a song called tell
[SPEAKER_02]: me laurel, which are all the kind of newer
Carter Reeves singles and grip Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's an older one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, you know same same style and
so Super blooms my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like I was Telling I was getting
like heavy into kind of like groove bass
[SPEAKER_02]: music drum, you know Just if one the drum
and the bass lock in all is well in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world And you know that kind of surf tones
and psychedelia and all this stuff So it's
[SPEAKER_02]: funny because I put out super bloom tell
me laurel and and let it slide under
[SPEAKER_02]: Carter Reeves They didn't get much
traction but listening back to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go these would be some pretty rad surfer
girl songs Yeah, especially super bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right if it would fit right in I
think would fit right in and so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know sometimes I look back and say
Hey, you know, maybe I should have just
[SPEAKER_02]: held on to that for what I knew with this
was Was the project with the hope and the
[SPEAKER_02]: excitement behind it?
[SPEAKER_06]: But so you're gonna put Carter Reeves on
hold from a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I was I was having a bit of
an identity crisis, you know, I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know I didn't know what I was doing and
and and and it was it didn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_02]: working Well creating is what you were
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I always look at that I go Yeah,
once you create something Unless you
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't uncreate it exactly that right
there is a win already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so So family off Cali roots rhythm
2021.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah kind of like relates to that whole
album.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right and yeah What an amazing
opportunity that did to collaborate with
[SPEAKER_06]: frickin Kali buds It was a how did you get
a hold of Colin and how did that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a wild couple weeks because I got a
call from from Adam saying Kali listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to invite you to be on the the
Kali the the 2021 riddome and like You
[SPEAKER_02]: know immediately and oh, it's produced by
Johnny Cosmic by the way and Kali and so
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately I was just like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, that's a big deal But on top of that
the fact that Kali even took the time to
[SPEAKER_02]: listen and gets down with the project and
likes it I was just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up I grew up listening to Kali as
well Yeah, he didn't have as strong an
[SPEAKER_02]: impact as you know, some of those other
guys, but I was a big fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I like calling buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so in Collins very nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's Sweetheart, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so he was crazy because it went
from Hey, you want to hop on this rhythm
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was yeah sure and I actually had a
really hard time writing to it at first
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think I wanted to do something
so crazy and then I kind of just let Let
[SPEAKER_02]: the heart take over a little bit and
that's where we ended up I really loved
[SPEAKER_02]: the song and I sent it to Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is super unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else is really sounding like this
One on it and Kali heard it and he called
[SPEAKER_02]: me up and he was like, this is really dope
man This is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you And then you know two weeks
later I got a call from my booking agent
[SPEAKER_02]: saying what do you think about doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three weeks with Kali buds on tour this
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said Okay, great and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I play his song too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the song we did together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just like oh my gosh So it went it
that was kind of the first seal of
[SPEAKER_02]: approval, you know and and that one felt
really good That was a Yeah, that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just he sent over the instrumental for
2022 which obviously I can't share but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not invited to be on for 2022 but I listen
to the beat and I go Oh shit, did people
[SPEAKER_02]: are gonna like this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a good one coming up for 22.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that kind of reminded me of Mike
loves 2020 the 2020 one and that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first one they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, yeah Mike Mike's kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my club.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you have a new single out with the hip
abduction called too Yeah, and how did
[SPEAKER_06]: this collab come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was fun This one's got kind of a
cool story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I You know, I was writing the album and
and You know producing it all out as demos
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of over a year and some change and
and it a lot of them had empty verses You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, just like empty second verses empty
first verses, you know in hopes that Maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: a feature would come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and this one just sat empty for a
long time So I started writing up some
[SPEAKER_02]: verses and saying, you know, I'm happy to
fill it out You know, but I still think we
[SPEAKER_02]: can find someone that will put a weird and
cool spin on it because it's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: got a hip-hop vibe to it definitely in the
beat and so The label put me in touch with
[SPEAKER_02]: with David knew from from the hip
abduction and he's the one that did the
[SPEAKER_02]: verses Yeah, and he they put me in touch
just hey, this is a guy in the scene He
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of is doing this like indie funk folk
kind of reggae thing like he was on the
[SPEAKER_02]: fringe the same way I think the surfer
girl project is is kind of on the fringe a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit and We just kind of like we
just started texting back and forth kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of hit it off a little bit I didn't ask
him to get on any music, you know And it
[SPEAKER_02]: just so happened that he was gonna be in
Asheville, North Carolina on a camping
[SPEAKER_02]: trip the same time that I The band was
opening for the elevators so he In
[SPEAKER_06]: Asheville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and at the salvage station in
Asheville and I'm gonna call you out David
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare you call me an hour before the
show asking for guest list tickets?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta give me at least five days in
advance No, but I gave him shit for that
[SPEAKER_02]: too So I was like, yeah, see what I can do
if I can squeeze you in I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know doors are in an hour and We get
him to the show and and he's there and he
[SPEAKER_02]: catches the whole set.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, you know watches the whole
set Just having a good time and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: play I played too because I was just
Freestyling a second verse or just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: going off of a second time and after the
show he goes What's that last song on the
[SPEAKER_02]: set?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one's too, you know, just enough
for two, you know, I'm just just finishing
[SPEAKER_02]: it now This one sounds like it might not
be so yeah, that's a then I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that sounds you know enough for two
still workshop and it's still want to work
[SPEAKER_02]: on the production and there's an empty
verse And he was just like that's the hit
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a hit that was my favorite one out
of the whole set I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just like yeah, you mind if I do
some production on it, too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean if you've ever listened to hip
abduction, you know, David produces all if
[SPEAKER_06]: not a lot of that Cool tunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a great producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so You know I sent it to him pretty
much just like copied and pasted that
[SPEAKER_02]: first verse area in the second verse And
he stripped it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He added like, you know some sub bass to
it He added a new little guitar line on
[SPEAKER_02]: top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the bass is funky and he sent it
back with these breezy kind of reverb very
[SPEAKER_02]: indeed out vocals and I go I'm kind of
bringing this hip-hop sing rap aggression
[SPEAKER_02]: thing going on and in a high hook and then
Comes to his verse and it kind of strips
[SPEAKER_02]: back and he's just breezy on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like I wanted something weird I
wanted something different not just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: rap verse or You know just kind of A
boring verse and David came through and
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, the hip abduction hit it with a
that's a great song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig it That's that that's I took a took
a note from the Grateful Dead on that
[SPEAKER_02]: little melody is kind of a weird little
yeah It's like a discombobulating.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah weird little thing goes into the G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, mix a little you got it
[SPEAKER_06]: So right after and and speaking of an
enough for two I want to thank LA Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: for Giving us enough for two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then and then some and some
other tears.

fellow New England guy on there God he
[SPEAKER_02]: just graced it with his smooth smooth
voice This one's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of got like a Jack Johnson vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more acoustic It's a lot more
textural and and and organic Got got got
[SPEAKER_02]: schweezy on the album.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with little stranger on a
record How cool man, I got a good friend
[SPEAKER_02]: of mine obby the nomad who's an incredible
rapper out of Houston and then We got
[SPEAKER_02]: Marcia from the skints.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not I don't know if you're familiar
with the skints But they're a really
[SPEAKER_06]: killer Reggae ska rock band a really cool
tune.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had about a year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean they've had Yeah,
they've been rocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been keeping up with you guys I
do remember the skins on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's very forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's okay But and she and I you
know, we had been we met Eight years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: and we actually lived together in Brooklyn
for a hot minute and and She had just been
[SPEAKER_02]: a friend for a while and we we lost touch
for a good bit and then you know When I
[SPEAKER_02]: when we kind of made the dabble back into
the the the modern reggae space,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know She was the first person I hit up
just being like yo Tell me about it It's
[SPEAKER_02]: that LA Cannabis Co she's seeing things
Well, you know Marcia she's incredible and
[SPEAKER_02]: the skins are incredible and and You know,
I was kind of like, you know, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

world has missed you this space has missed
[SPEAKER_02]: you and and I was like you want to get on
a song She's like, yeah, of course and so
[SPEAKER_02]: she's she's the homie and and she doesn't

and when does it get released?
[SPEAKER_02]: September 9th or 10th.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whatever the weekend right after
Labor Day is Would have been nice to have
[SPEAKER_02]: it pop out in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I think it's got a good fall
vibe, but it's also All all of the music
[SPEAKER_02]: was Run through the filter of Johnny
Cosmic Wow So I produced everything but
[SPEAKER_02]: then I took it up to Johnny and you know,
he knows how to take something that sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good to incredible so The new
Brian, you know did for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like without Johnny's touch on this
album.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been it would have been
solid Yeah, but he takes it to the next
[SPEAKER_02]: level and so we complement each other
really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really cool Lucky got to work with
Johnny for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got a few Quick questions
rapid-fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah most memorable gig Red Rocks opening
