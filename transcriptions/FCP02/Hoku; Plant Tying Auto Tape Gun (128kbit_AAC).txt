[SPEAKER_00]: check it out so I've seen the orchard guys
use these things for tying up vines and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot but finally got one for the farm
and it's just a auto taper like typically
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used that green you know metal twine
but it's gonna save a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: just staples and plastic tape so trying to
get away from using a trellis it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely serves a purpose and it's quick
and dirty but I don't know we'll see how I
[SPEAKER_00]: like it probably made a bunch of work for
myself but be nice just working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants not having to get tangled up
especially harvest time so yeah if you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't seen one of these and still tying
up your plants check them out
