[SPEAKER_00]: This week's subject that we're gonna chat
about is sort of, there was a guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so at the time, there was a guy that
ended up giving Neville four different
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things ended up permeating a
bunch of Neville's hybrids and crosses and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were pretty important even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we'd talk about it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today's edition in our reoccurring
series on cannabis history is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: about Jim Ortega and the strains that he
gave Neville and sort of what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: with those, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the mid-80s, when Neville started
his seed company, he garnered a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest from Americans, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is how he ended up trading with a
bunch of them and sort of like filling out
[SPEAKER_00]: his diversity of his seed stock from
people, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the people that was interested
in what he was doing was this guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe this is his real name,
but they called him Jim Ortega,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave Neville the maple leaf indica,
the garlic bud, the kush four,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Hawaiian, there was something
called Hawaiian indica, those four things,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess we'll start with the things
that, and so here's the gig, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The history of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as I'm aware, okay, we'll call
him Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim is alive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has periodically, although fairly
rarely, popped up on the interwebs and
[SPEAKER_00]: added some depth to things, but he has not
really laid out a ton of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, somebody asked what year is
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say this is in the mid-80s,
mid to late 80s, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just based on how Neville operated,
I would imagine that he probably got this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from Ortega probably around 86,
because he was good on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was definitely moving his process
along.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he got something within the next one or
two years, it would be introduced to his
[SPEAKER_02]: program, it would end up in the catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a good gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 86 is the year that still has all the
fucky shit, it has the stuff from fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Watson, it has all that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of what we know about these lines
comes from Neville working them into
[SPEAKER_00]: releases that he made, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then much, much later than that,
on the Mr. Nice forum and say like the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009, 2010 era, Neville popped up on the
forum and started chatting for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where the vast majority of
what we know, okay, about this comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an interesting thing
because like when you talk about Kana
[SPEAKER_00]: history, there are probably people that
are still alive out there that know far
[SPEAKER_00]: more than we do about the origins of these
things, where they came from, what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were mixed with, all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not been made public,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know is basically from Neville
getting them, what he saw in the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and deciding and what he decided to
say about them and his educated guesses
[SPEAKER_02]: and one of the things that is so cool
about these specific lines is that because
[SPEAKER_02]: they were so prolific in their time and
across the Dutch market, not only do we
[SPEAKER_02]: have things that he said, but in the case
of things like garlic bud that became,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can say that, but in the case of things
like garlic bud and what they become,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have this huge range of people that
had grown them over many, many years and
[SPEAKER_02]: have their own anecdotes, all of those
lines barring a few were sold widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that whether or not Jim
made them all, whether or not he was the
[SPEAKER_00]: middleman and he acquired them from
different friends and passed them along,
[SPEAKER_00]: their origin story starts with him giving
them to Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe we should start there because
one of the few anecdotes we have of a
[SPEAKER_02]: previous time was Neville's rundown in
that 90 catalog when he said, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Afghani mix came from the collection
of someone named Maple Leaf Wilson and who
[SPEAKER_02]: that is, who that may be, we don't know,
but that seems like it is the only
[SPEAKER_02]: singular piece of that story that precedes
him actually looking through the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that story may or may not be what Jim
Ortega told Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these seeds come from America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's not from America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears that he mailed them to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will start, I'm going to start
backwards and we'll start with the two
[SPEAKER_00]: that I feel like have, I don't want to say
the least impact, but got used the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville had this Hawaiian indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know all its permutations of what
happened with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it appears that Neville took this line
and he crossed it to NL1, which was what
[SPEAKER_00]: he kind of did to most things back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL1 was sort of like the only like in seed
form, pure cush variety that he,
[SPEAKER_00]: pure indica variety that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he crossed Hawaiian indica to NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he released it as Hawaiian indica
by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's pics of it in his seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, it got released under Sensei,
although they dropped the by NL1 and just
[SPEAKER_00]: sold it as maple leaf or they sold it as
Hawaiian indica without any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifiers that it had been blended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some pictures in Neville's
old catalogs and different things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that of this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's possible that it ended up
in some of Sensei's later works and some
[SPEAKER_00]: certain later hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sort of appears a little bit as
sort of like a singular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know for sure that it permeated
through other work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that he gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this thing called Kush4.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we didn't know very much about at
all until Neville started posting in 2009,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that stuff seems to be is,
according to Neville, it was kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he crossed it to what he considered
his other Kush line that he had,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he released something the last two or
three years of his seed bank called Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: by Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would also seem there was actually a
selection of that as well, because when
[SPEAKER_02]: you saw, I guess what we're supposed to
believe is the final iteration of his work
[SPEAKER_02]: that was available, the Ortega 1,
2, and 3 lines that Kip from Legends was
[SPEAKER_02]: the one selling the early 2000s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were all, you know,
NL early hybrids with the Ortega and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of them was, I think it was the 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the one that I fucking had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm using my hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have screenshots of the makeup of all
those ones from later on, but they're on
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone and I'm using my phone right now
to chat with everyone so I can't look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can go look in Neville's old
catalogs, probably about 89, 90-ish,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see something called Kush by
Kush, which later he clarified was Kush 4
[SPEAKER_00]: by NL2, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and he believes,
you can take this for what you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: he believes that what we consider Kush in
our OG Kush, TK, all that different stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: he felt that stuff looks so similar to it,
it was probably descended from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he went so far as to say that he
believed that OG Kush was just NL2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is interesting because we have a
more common, like, metric for what NL2
[SPEAKER_02]: looked like through Oasis than original
packs of NL2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you compare them, it's so night
and day.
[SPEAKER_02]: What came out of Oasis never looked like
OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes me wonder what we hadn't seen
of NL2 that made him so convinced that OG
[SPEAKER_02]: that he saw in his later years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is just fucking- I mean,
he might have picked a particularly cushy
[SPEAKER_00]: in his mind looking NL2 to cross to the
Kush 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a screenshot from Mr. Nice where he
literally says he believes that hybrid is
[SPEAKER_00]: the foundation of today's Kush lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not that's true, I can't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never bought those lines from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I tried desperately to get those
fucking Ortega 2 F2s that fucking Getsloth
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Magus made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the fucking- I got the Ortega 2
hybrid up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was how I made Purity Ring on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I couldn't get any of those F2s
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew they were like 22 years old
when I tried to pop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I took my best stab at trying to
see what the fuck was there in a loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were a seed line that was available
for probably three, four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he made some comments about
what the- you know, he clarified what was
[SPEAKER_00]: in it years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made some comments about what he
thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not really- that's really all
we know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say that we should probably
take a moment because I feel like most
[SPEAKER_02]: people's idea of Kush 4 now is a plant
that looks very, very similar to Bubba
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and has been shared with various
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know CSI has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Bodhi has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they both made hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that, is that what Kush 4 was
originally?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that someone was like,
hey, this is Kush 4.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even metrics we should have today,
how reliable they are, we can't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's also a thing, too,
for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it much lately,
but there was percolating around collector
[SPEAKER_00]: circles about seven or eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Kush 4 clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was reputed to be,
you know, from that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very, you know, it's just it's
just soaked in mystery from so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, out of all the things that
Jim did say when he came back,
[SPEAKER_02]: if anyone needs to find things that Jim
said or post, he posted as dogless on a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: But out of all the things that he did say,
and some of them were a little much,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he never verified that that cut
that goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, no, he did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did pop up on on the forums over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did clarify what he sent Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did do some back and forths and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems like it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next two things that I'm going to talk
about or we're going to talk about are
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are sort of the meat and
potatoes of what Ortega gave Neville in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that they got much more widely
used and they're much more familiar to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think I'll leave the big one for
last.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the third thing that he gave was
garlic bud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neville had a whole bunch of thoughts
about garlic bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville called garlic bud a pre Sam skunk,
which probably irritates the piss out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam if he's listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those those guys are those guys that the
those guys are the original weed beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not to tap into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sure I was a child or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes down to it, what we do
know is that is that Neville sold garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: bud as a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, for for very, you know, he sold it and
is in his seed bank company.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put pictures of it and he said it
was a very high yielding, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: donkey dick, as you like to as people like
to say sometimes donkey dick style buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he viewed it as a skunk archetype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say that's interesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting, especially with the
garlic, is because we don't have an exact
[SPEAKER_02]: distinction about how Neville received all
of the seeds that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a chance that what we call garlic
bud and what we call, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maple leaf in reference to, you know,
the Afghan key in the Afghaness might have
[SPEAKER_02]: actually just been the same group of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we we know what we know what they told
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so garlic bud was widely sold by
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it was very popular because you can go
back and look at the catalog and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: have this picture of this plant with this
monster colas, monster side branching,
[SPEAKER_00]: resinous, very, very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it into all kinds of things
because it had that, as he likes to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it, donkey dick style buds.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain genesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so we'll jump ahead briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Neville got busted, when Neville
got busted and he ended up having to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: up, having to sell his company to to the
drunkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sell his seed stock to Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei did not want to just make it seem
like their company was a direct port from
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that's fair?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's absolutely accurate,
but I mean, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did, OK, is they changed the
name of garlic bud to Shiva Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, named after Ben's daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shiva Shanti was sold a lot longer
than garlic bud was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about that,
and this is a whole story in itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that since he was lazy enough,
they they didn't change the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't change the advertisement like
the average they did change.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did change the advertisement,
but they mostly kept the same verbiage and
[SPEAKER_00]: language.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like it was very direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a few sentences out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they changed some names.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So garlic bud is Shiva Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a direct it's a it's a direct
port.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm not exactly sure and I don't
know if it's ever been clarified by anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: close, but there is a Shiva Shanti one and
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there was the more Afghan version of
Shiva Shanti that came out later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder how each one of those was made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like was one, you know, F2s of a different
mom and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the sad thing about the drunkers
is that they're both still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they could be an immense fount
of knowledge and history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historical information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically decided to say Sensi is
the exact same as always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the parents are the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the lions are the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always been by from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not particularly help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So garlic bud Shiva Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the length of time that it was
sold as seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up probably in a lot more weed than
most people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up in all kinds of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up in all kinds of stuff from,
you know, Neville gave a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock from from Shant from to Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jim Ortega giving the garlic line to
there was a version of Black Domino that
[SPEAKER_00]: had garlic in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there was a there was a lot of there
was a lot of things that permeated from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still sold today.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what most people don't know is that
when they bought the company, most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that they sold at Sensi were large
amounts of Neville seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he had already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't actually make anything new
for the first three or four years that
[SPEAKER_00]: they bought the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just sold stock that they had already
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably the last two, two,
two, three years, I can't remember if it
[SPEAKER_00]: was 88 or 89 that he came out with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the last two or three years you could
buy garlic bud from the seed bank and then
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably from like 90 to 95,
you could brought 91 to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy Shiva Shanti that was
probably the same damn seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, you know, direct from from
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that bud from Jim Ortega made
a huge impact because tons of people
[SPEAKER_00]: bought Shiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's rumors that, like,
for instance, the Ohio dumpster is a is a
[SPEAKER_00]: is a Shiva Shanti Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably in a lot more things than we
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, probably honestly, it's probably
in a lot more things than we than than we
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so, you know, the I'm ignoring
tons of comments, guys, because I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay focused on what we're chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'll get distracted and I'm
trying to get like I'm trying to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent thing out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll get back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, garlic bud Shiva Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the interesting thing about
garlic bud is that it doesn't seem it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like it was always a seed line.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which meant which was important because it
meant that it wasn't dependent on one
[SPEAKER_00]: clone staying alive in order to make the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you have a line that relies on a
single clone mother or father or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a breeding, it's delicate because
that thing has to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that you get that's an actual
line, it's a little easier to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: going, because even if you lose some of
it, if you have a bunch of seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pop it and find stuff you want and
just make more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have a whole line.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so I would say that the first two
things we mentioned, the least,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the least impact just in terms
of how often they were used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garlic was used on all kinds of stuff and
Shiva Shanti was used in all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a pretty huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the thing that the thing that Jim
Ortega gave to Neville that probably had
[SPEAKER_00]: the most impact was what Crybaby already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing called Maple Leaf Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, he gave Maple Leaf Indica to Neville.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neville popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like he got a whole bunch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not only did Neville pop the seeds
and find various phenos that became famous
[SPEAKER_00]: and ended up in all kinds of different
things, but he had so much seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: he decided to sell that original seed and
he called it what did he call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Original Afghan mix or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Original Afghan mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would sell literally he would sell
Breeders packs in the 89 and 90 catalog of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that he got that was just the same
seeds that he pulled all of his famous
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so the reason why Maple Leaf
became so impactful is because he had this
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno of Maple Leaf that he called Afghan
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he crossed this to skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became the basis of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is obviously one of the most
longtime, extremely famous lines that has
[SPEAKER_00]: ever existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also his best selling line by
Miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sold so much of that fucking line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would probably be shocking to think
about, you know, that kind of seed
[SPEAKER_02]: movement and the fucking lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he analyzed his own sales and he
analyzed Sensi's sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was the best selling
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he basically took some stuff from Jim
Ortega and he crossed it to some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from Sam and he ended up with this,
you know, he called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put the skunk because Sam had
intentionally been breeding the skunk out
[SPEAKER_00]: of skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt that by throwing this skunk line
back on the Afghan, the Afghan,
[SPEAKER_00]: he brought out the original skunkiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will go back a second because,
you know, one of the similarities in all
[SPEAKER_02]: of this and one of the shared like little
commentaries is one of the reasons that it
[SPEAKER_02]: seems, although not confirmed that garlic
and maple might actually be the same seed
[SPEAKER_02]: line, not just two different things,
is because that commentary about being a
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk archetype was used about Afghan tea
in particular as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that, you know, what was it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was like, you know, the archetype
of Sam's skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, Afghan tea is the base
of a lot of lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so before we go any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this one's going to take up a
chunk of time for a second because it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville made some interesting
observations, right, about how he thought
[SPEAKER_00]: he understood the maple leaf line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it kept throwing different phenos that
would throw him off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said when he first started popping
maple leaf, he got these like very big bud
[SPEAKER_00]: style chunky like bubblegum smelling
Afghan phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought, oh, this is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said that he started popping
some stuff and he started getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: very hash plant, very frosty, very dark,
hashy type plants that he called Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he popped more and he found these
sister plants that he ended up calling
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan tea and Afghan S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought these were more like skunk
archetypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger buds, longer running buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all in the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all in the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he found when he bred with them that
they tended to breed true to type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though all those types were within
the line itself, you know, he felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: the bubblegum big bud ones tended to breed
more big bud bubblegum style plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hashy Ortega ones tended to breed more
hashy, dark, thick Afghan plants.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghan S and Afghan T were two of his
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used them in all kinds of hybrids and
he ended up making a ton of stuff of which
[SPEAKER_00]: only a tiny percentage got released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and there's a lot of
stories like he mentioned, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maple leaf, maple leaf Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of rumors about where this
stuff came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that we could talk about a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is that they came from
Jim Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim and Neville both agree that that's
where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jim has never seen worth it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For lack of a better way to put it,
to come out and lay out whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: these things he made, whether these things
he collected, who he got them from,
[SPEAKER_00]: what their parentage or lineage might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we have is Neville's observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way I said Jim was a big collector
and had his people and the things that he
[SPEAKER_02]: did make were things like the queso negro
and stuff, the cheese Mexican or fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, early stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that Neville's own words kind
of, you know, have that same implication.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these things came from the
collection of someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is someone who isn't who,
you know, we know that I got them from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but regardless of how they occurred or
anything else, it just doesn't seem like
[SPEAKER_02]: he has interest in what Jim has seemed to
be very interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've been completely ignoring the
commentary because I haven't wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw off anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only person whose comments I've been
putting on the screen were Dwight's
[SPEAKER_01]: comments as you were talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I'm not going to out Dwight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if Nine Eye DJ is Dwight, then he is
one of Neville's very, very old friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was around in the 80s and he was
present for a lot of this history that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're speaking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's also just a really nice,
cool person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel very happy that that he's in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like him quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate he's taken I've
spent hours chatting with him on various
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a straight OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows a lot of the old history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so anyway, the reason I've been
ignoring all the comments is because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone off into like Todd and NL land and I
didn't really want to get completely
[SPEAKER_00]: sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that Neville loved the
maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got everybody got obviously
famous, you know, from the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Neville made his first NL five
Hayes crosses, but when Neville crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hayes, his two favorite Indicas at the
moment were the were the Afghan T and the
[SPEAKER_00]: NL and the NL five, you know, that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he made Hayes by Afghan T as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he ever released it,
you know, but he had it and he called it I
[SPEAKER_00]: even think he called it silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really confusing because then
later on, once he released the silver
[SPEAKER_00]: since he released a silver Hayes that was
silver Pearl by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very it was very it was very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville made a ton like a literal ton
of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had I want to say three to five Finos
of Maple Leaf Indica pure Maple Leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica that he gave specific names to
Afghan T was one Afghan S was another he
[SPEAKER_00]: had one that he called Ortega 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These got used a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These got passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ortega stuff went over to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those seeds and they were
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis Legends Ultimate Indica was based
upon Neville's Maple Leaf work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the super skunk has has been
probably one of the most things that was
[SPEAKER_00]: bred in by tons of people into tons of
work and Shanti still uses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses a Neville super skunk male to this
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Afghan T exists in a lot of
different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I should say it's just it was
basically just like one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: staples and whether it got name changed or
whether it got bred into different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became one of the big backbones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, candle candle love
nortal too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the T and the S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smashed up with skunk one and like those
things hit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't know if they thrived
there, but they certainly did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was things that Neville made that he
didn't release that batches of seeds got
[SPEAKER_00]: out to other folks in Canada and
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they ended up making lines and
releasing lines of things that Neville had
[SPEAKER_00]: bothered to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was you know, there was all
kinds of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at impact,
as Crybaby mentioned 10 minutes ago or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, Neville, when Neville
analyzed sales, both at his company and at
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei, super skunk was probably the best
selling line of the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just got blended into umpteenth
million things, which meant that the maple
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf that Jim Ortega had given to Neville
ended up in just all kinds of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: renamed or elsewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still percolates to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that that Shanti
just revealed not that long ago in an
[SPEAKER_00]: interview with his son.
[SPEAKER_00]: But super skunk was something that was
bred by Neville, but that Sensei ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: trademarking the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went over to Amsterdam after
Neville left Sensei and was working with
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse, he would sell this stuff
called Ultra Ultra Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was basically super skunk,
but it couldn't have the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, Neville gave a super
skunk breeding male to Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shanti couldn't call it super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at his breeding and if you
see an Afghan skunk male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the super skunk male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it literally is getting back to the to
the maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maple leaf is literally and it's in so
many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the final things, one of the
final things I should say about maple leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: is that what's interesting about maple
leaf is that when Neville when the company
[SPEAKER_00]: went from Neville's own company to being
owned by the drunkers in Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maple leaf fell off the menu for about
seven to eight years, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the in the very late 90s,
I don't know, we were trying to we were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out exactly what year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just going to say the very late
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei re-released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maple Leaf Indica as a line that they
still sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crybaby and I were trying to figure out
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know because Sensei doesn't tell
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville made a lot of hybrids that
were basically 75 percent maple,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 percent skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he took a lot of the phenos that
he liked, like Afghan S, Afghan T,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ortega 15, so and so mashed them together,
used skunk as a pollen donor for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's entirely possible,
although we're not sure, that the that
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei revived the Maple Leaf Indica line
from those mostly maple leaf, but slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk hybrids that Neville had made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what seems most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what seems most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know for sure, but we do know for
sure that after seven or eight years of
[SPEAKER_00]: being off the menu, it re-popped up on the
menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the maple leaf, including the
stuff that Crybaby and I and our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Rings and stuff like that has been
percolating around, is from that late 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: very early 2000s Sensei releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, and, you know,
so it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It percolates around out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant, those that seed line that that
Jim Ortega gave to Neville, Neville loved
[SPEAKER_00]: and he crossed it with basically
everything good that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He released some lines officially under
his own brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei released some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mixed into all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a version of Black Domino that
had the garlic bud in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a version of Black Domino that
had the Afghan S in there, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of there was a lot of
different things released.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Shanti, because Shanti bought a
chunk of Neville's collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: both I believe clones and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably a lot of that percolating
around through Shanti's work because it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like that super skunk male is one of
the cornerstones of his breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that it exists in all kinds of
forms throughout different different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's sort of one of the big it
became one of the big backbones of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because Neville liked it so much,
crossed it with so many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it popped up and percolated in
different companies in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: different companies in Switzerland,
different Holland companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just I think its impact,
you know, despite being like here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: funny thing, right, is that Jim Ortega has
decided not to tell us very much more than
[SPEAKER_00]: we already know about this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that Neville liked it
enough and other people have liked it
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to keep working with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me, that's the greatest compliment
you can give cannabis is when people like
[SPEAKER_00]: it enough to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over years, people still want it
to keep finding it, to keep working with
[SPEAKER_00]: it because they like it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, think about this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of I mean, what would conventionally
be seen in a commerce sense as one of
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville's greatest rivals in the early era
when they had the opportunity to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: number three Ortega seed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made a whole fucking deal out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hank made it the biggest fucking deal when
Dutch Passion released that Ortega number
[SPEAKER_02]: three, and it was in these special boxes
and it was a fucking legacy pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was someone who did actually have
weed that was unique from Neville in the
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier because he was the big hash
smuggler way back and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he had Dutch shit that wasn't Sam,
that wasn't Neve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when a decade later he had the
opportunity at Pounce on He was like this
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna I'm fucking I'm getting this
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm releasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great example when when the
impact of your work actually makes your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking competition consider that they
need a piece of that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to do something with that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cool part is that a seed deal that
Neville made in the late in the mid to
[SPEAKER_00]: late 80s, okay, still dramatically impacts
the cannabis scene today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, you know, you know, and and a lot
of you know, a lot of the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, just to switch back to like when
Gabby, I don't know if Gabby is still in
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but when Gabby and I were doing a
bunch of that super dog work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That had super skunk from Neville in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whether or not people get credited
or not, you know, Jim giving that to Jim
[SPEAKER_00]: giving that to Neville and then Neville
popularizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep using it, you know, so people were
using it in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were using it in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby and I were using it in our own way
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets used and used and used,
you know, all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just has ended up being a
combination of, you know, a Jizel,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's all kinds of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it keeps popping up in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is one of the biggest backbones
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, and this kind of goes back
to, you know, where we started hours ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what does it mean to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you started with what's essentially
very close to primordial material in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis world, you know, did your work
with it and managed to reface the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking game, the whole industry,
the nature of what people wanted for an
[SPEAKER_02]: indefinite future is, I mean, how can you
breathe any further than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny part about this is that,
you know, we were trying to keep these
[SPEAKER_00]: shows to two hours or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that when we started this chat
about this week's history lesson that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would be able to bring it in a little
shorter than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just goes to show how wide ranging
that trade or that deal that Neville made
[SPEAKER_00]: with Jim did and how, you know,
and how impactful it was and how impactful
[SPEAKER_00]: it continues to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I think like a lot of the
original Afghan, you know, Afghan mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: parents are dead, but it's children and
grandchildren and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, really continue to impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can't do genetic testing
and stuff like that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's in so many different
things because it tasted good and it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled good and it made nice bud
structure and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at it, that Afghan skunk,
if you look, if you go on Mr. Nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seed bank or something and you
look for things that have Afghan skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: that breeding male that Neville gave him
is one of the four or five backbone
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding males that is still in all of his
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been used and used and used over
and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has, you know, used to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, because it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been used by different companies
in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different companies have taken
different permutations of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things and gone in their own directions
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wish today I could still get
Louie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Legends Ultimate Indica,
it would be it would be pretty neat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and and those guys in Canada and
Blockhead and some of that different stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were making with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just random seeds that they
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Black Domina was out of seeds that I
personally bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the coolest thing that I found,
you know, and, you know, speaking of
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking of Gabby, Gabby's buddy gave us a
Black Domina that I was tasted like
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I still had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you mentioned that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still regret losing that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it it it was real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I think what happened is is
that's a story for a different time
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can get on we can get on
tangents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll save that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in in in closing on this week's
history of mysterious guy from America
[SPEAKER_00]: that chose the moniker Jim Ortega,
did some trades with Neville, gave Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff ended up being fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up using it in all kinds of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it keeps taking on a life of its own
and popping up in different breeders work
[SPEAKER_00]: still today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rundown was immaculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
