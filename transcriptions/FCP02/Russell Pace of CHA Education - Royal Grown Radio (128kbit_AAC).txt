[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everyone and thank you so much for
tuning in to Royal Ground Radio.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Michael Beck, joined as always by the
fantastic Rick Elliott.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey hey!
[SPEAKER_04]: And today we have a very special guest,
founder of Cha Education, educator,
[SPEAKER_04]: inspiration, regenerative farmer,
research scientist, and general
[SPEAKER_04]: participant in life, Russell Payne.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pleasure to meet you, Russell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the invite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really nice to kind of sit down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we actually crossed paths one other
time last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably crossed paths more,
but we hung out last year at the Emerald
[SPEAKER_04]: Cup and happened to be on opposite sides
of a conversation with Brandon Rust,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of me not knowing who you were,
probably you not knowing who I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the last year we've kind of
chatted about trying to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really enjoy your content.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been consuming it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a wide variety of like incredibly
useful information and beneficial
[SPEAKER_04]: information for the people out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to kind of dig into a little bit of
what got you to where you are,
[SPEAKER_04]: what inspired you to take the path and,
you know, get to where you are today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you end up in Humboldt first
off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, funny story.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, there's a long backstory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose I, you know, it, you know,
in a bizarre way, it kind of started when
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 12 years old and I went to Tibet
when I was 12 and I saw weed growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: the mountainous hills and even at
monasteries high up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of, I don't know, it was just
like this thing where I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant, what is this plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and I didn't even know
what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad was like, well, son, that's a
marijuana plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, I'd like it even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this weird affinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can't explain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like this, like magnetic attraction
to this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously at 12 years old,
you know what weed is, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was pretty sheltered and I mean,
I knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never, I'd never smoked it before,
but I was a little bit of a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see growing up in Humboldt at 12,
you smoke, but growing up where I did,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was like not as common,
you know, dare, you hear about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I went through the dare program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a funny start because me and
my buddy, Riley Berry, I went with this
[SPEAKER_02]: kid from LA that I grew up with and his
grandmother, his family actually was the
[SPEAKER_02]: Berry family who, um, his great uncle
wrote Peter Pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were like, you know,
loaded and had money from the silk trade
[SPEAKER_02]: in the orient and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how this whole trip kind of
got set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like this weird little,
thing with them wanting to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like with a film crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were making a documentary about like
the warriors of calm and these like high
[SPEAKER_02]: mountainous plains in Tibet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just like tug tagged along in this
like crazy saga anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but we were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so we were, I'd never forget,
we were outside this monastery high up in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hills and we're like, dude,
let's like steal some, let's try to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't know what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was July.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plants were just vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he just like ripped off some fan leaves
when no one was looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like took them and this sweet old
Chinese lady named Bernice that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: with was smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got her to bomb us a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like emptied out the tobacco,
dried out the leaves a few days later,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then like pack the leaf in like
smoking this fan leaf out of a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, would you feel anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, I don't feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dude, I don't think we're doing
it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's not right, you know,
but you know, it's kind of a funny like
[SPEAKER_02]: backstory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time I smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was just growing, growing wild
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that spot was cultivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, that was the first,
I think I have a photo of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an old photo book of all these
photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you walk up to the monastery,
it was like a, you know, six by six plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was like a actual, you could tell
that was a cultivation patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other patches growing out were just
like fair, you know, wild, wild,
[SPEAKER_02]: wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was growing up and even out of the
streets, some of the streets, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cracks, like just wherever,
but yeah, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like, that was off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was off to, off to the races and just
like kind of dabbled in weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bounced around a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved back and forth between California
and Virginia quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, like high school,
you try to grow in the red solo cups,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, you know, that all that
jazz and, you know, in college was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was in college back in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just, you know, we grew out in
the, in, out in the hills of West
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia, up in the mountain, like trying
to like find little patches, really some
[SPEAKER_02]: very more dangerous out on the East coast
with laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just try to be more careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so I'm kind of like backstory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Re-orient here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got my degree in geology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bachelor of science in geology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was working down in Orange County
after, after college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just, I was just getting burnt
out by the SoCal vibes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like all the gas stations are leaking
gasoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like remediating those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just, you know, growing weed on
the side, you know, indoors a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: and just like tired of driving through
traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I got, I got to get out of
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, and I was going through a
lot of existential healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had like bad allergies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, other immunological,
like imbalances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I just wanted to get the
fuck out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty much done with the LA vibe,
you know, LA is great and all,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just, and for some reason it was
just, you know, my mom, she's from Mount
[SPEAKER_02]: Shasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm familiar with Humboldt,
you know, even though I'd never really
[SPEAKER_02]: been, it was sort of like this magical,
mysterious, like land of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came up here in 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: To work on my master's, my excuse was I'm
going to just go get my master's degree in
[SPEAKER_02]: geology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I joke around, I dropped that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never completed my master's and I just
got a master's in botany or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: biology or, you know, plant chemistry or
phytochemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all of the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minors in, maybe a minor in mycology and
entomology, you know, kind of like just
[SPEAKER_02]: studying, I just switched gears because
geology is cool, but it doesn't really do
[SPEAKER_02]: much good for, you know, solving immediate
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of the stuff does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I studied, I studied hydrogeology and
geochemistry and some soil science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a great, yeah, side component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, but you know, anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, tie in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tied in, it tied in nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, I just came up here and I
was like on this existential healing
[SPEAKER_02]: quest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to repair whatever this,
this illness is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met this guy in Arcata, John Yamas.
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless that man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was this crazy acupuncturist on top of
the G street.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, just do this and this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I switched my diet up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like over course of a few years,
like I had massive changes in health,
[SPEAKER_02]: just improvement, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like that's sort of what, like home,
it was just like, you know, thing with
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt is weed and healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like what drove me to go into
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found both of them quite,
quite, you know, extensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been here since I ever say,
you know, that's that back to nature
[SPEAKER_03]: movement, man, like, you know,
tapping in and finding all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, not just cannabis, but man,
yeah, there's a ton of people in here with
[SPEAKER_03]: some, yes, you know, incredible knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super shout out to Humboldt Herbals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those women were angels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They guided me through so many hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just go in there and just like,
what's this herb do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does this work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just like kindly like,
I would buy, buy stuff and then ask
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were such a huge catalyst for so many
people in the herbal healing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like cannabis brought a ton of people here
and I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The healing medicine of cannabis brings
people here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like, wait, this plant
heals.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about others?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about other plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about tea?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about diet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a catalyst for a greater
consciousness and movement for health and
[SPEAKER_04]: healing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree, those women at Humboldt
Herbals were certainly really important in
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of sparking the learning of a lot of
people in our circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I, you know, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually super jazzed to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like cannabis is, it's funny cause
people always talk about cannabis is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it occupies so many roles with increasing
consciousness, so to speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like some people would say it's,
it helped the regulations and testing on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis helped people understand how many
pesticides were used on food products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of increased awareness in that
field, you know, and especially then with
[SPEAKER_02]: herbal medicine, you know, it opens
people's doors to, oh, well, if this is
[SPEAKER_02]: herb that helps me, what other herbs also
help?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I could go on and on like, this is like
really gets me jazz.
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps drive people into the,
let your food be your medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: consciousness as well in a big way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it certainly did that for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started smoking weed and not long after
started choosing healthier foods and
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to be like, wow, why is,
why do I feel this way and cut dairy out
[SPEAKER_04]: of my life?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, I feel so much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just it, it opens the doors to
exploring health.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's pretty magical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I mean, so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the depth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of what I love about your content
is the focus on the details of
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative growing, gardening,
understanding what's happening above and
[SPEAKER_04]: below the soil line and kind of connecting
the dots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that's really
intrigued me about some of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: your on-farm experiences where you're
pulling back the tops of the soil and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're showing your inoculation of
mushrooms and how it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a symbiotic relationship in the soil.
And.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about how that like
consciousness changed after you moved
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tied into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another great tie in too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like, I was like had,
you know, three quarters fully inserted in
[SPEAKER_02]: the anthropogenic Western world,
really, you know, this like one quarter
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out what this other thing
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then coming in and as on this quest of
like, you know, learning about herbal
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and health, realizing how
mushrooms were a big important part of
[SPEAKER_02]: tying it in, you know, and it's like the
whole synergy between, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: taking psilocybin and expanding that level
of consciousness and then understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: from a mycological standpoint,
how adaptogenic mushrooms are good for
[SPEAKER_02]: your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how mushrooms also grow in the
soil and have a decomposition process and
[SPEAKER_02]: generate life that way as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole tie in really, and Humboldt to
me is like the mycological, like it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like a giant hyphal network.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these mycologists are all like super
hyped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, you know, passing around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting connected through
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's like the redwoods and
there's these like hyphae layers in the
[SPEAKER_02]: forest everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone I know hunts mushrooms almost
like I'm still the weak, weak link.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, take me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've hunted oyster mushrooms and I
need to go out and do chanterelles and I
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't done it much yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is a perfect catalyst.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should come out with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm right on the, in the coastal forest
before the redwoods up north of
[SPEAKER_04]: McKinleyville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really cool because this entire
area, the redwoods, everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just like a giant mycelium slick
almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the coastal forest, the spruce,
hemlock, alder, willow forests of that
[SPEAKER_04]: like kind of coastal wetland produce
mushrooms way more than a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: redwood forest, at least the edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sidebar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go get some hedgehogs and some
chanterelles sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause other, I've just been cultivating
them in my own, you know, getting mycelial
[SPEAKER_02]: mat mats or flats, you know, from like
Levon from fungi farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Levon's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, you know, just cultivating king
stropharia and some shiitake logs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I definitely like to get out in
the woods, but all right, we're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: tangenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole principle of Humboldt
represents this like interesting ecosystem
[SPEAKER_02]: where it is, it's, it's sort of pristine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just got this element of like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's magical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of magical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's disconnected from the rest
of the world in some degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a way it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The redwood curtain is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The redwood curtain is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like kind of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often joke that a fucking tree has
blocked capitalism from coming up here and
[SPEAKER_02]: fully developing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a tree has stopped that development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting to me,
just from a metaphorical standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's metaphorical, but it's so real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Caltrans project to try and widen
the 101 coming up here has been stopped by
[SPEAKER_04]: the redwood trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you at home that don't know
the kind of background of that statement,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's actually true that the redwoods have
stopped the wholesale, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: capitalistic development of this area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's two trees to be specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's two that are like really
the base of the argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two trees are just stopping that from
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Humboldt is really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't realize out there in the
world, you should come up and visit
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have like an amazing redwood forest and
a beautiful Pacific Ocean and not far off
[SPEAKER_02]: are the Trinity Alps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a really unique
micro-system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, Patrick's Point,
you know, it's just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got here almost 30 years ago,
there was a feeling that hit me like a bag
[SPEAKER_03]: of bricks of comfortability and a sense of
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, like I had been here
before and I knew that there was no way I
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to be able to leave ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to Ireland where 100% of
my ancestors are from on the west coast of
[SPEAKER_03]: Ireland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just mind blowing how similar
it was to the west coast of Ireland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, shit, no wonder why
I fucking love Humboldt so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt like I was home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that a funny thing?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's such a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my mom's family's from Italy,
Northern Italy, and then they migrated up
[SPEAKER_02]: to Mount Shasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like looking at photos from
where they're from in Northern Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, holy shit, this is like,
they just like went like, it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: micro fractal of where they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just found it somewhere else in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where I came from in Michigan,
my family is mostly from Germany going
[SPEAKER_04]: back and it's a huge German network and
very similar, at least especially a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred plus years ago, very, very
similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar to the black forest and those
original deciduous forests in the Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: part of Germany laying on the similar
latitude, just like a similar latitude to
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like really interesting to me how
that works like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so kind of tangenting back to the
topic, you know, the development of like
[SPEAKER_02]: the regenerative agriculture mindset was
really stimulated by mycology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the root of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, over the years you would
see all of these people performing these
[SPEAKER_02]: types of, you know, DIY projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I would try some and just
fail and they would like shank hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, well, what, how does
this, you know, how does this work or how
[SPEAKER_02]: does this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always, I don't know,
I was always driven by wanting to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out the science of it, you know,
just how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the science is figured out,
you don't need to think much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once, but the key is like figuring out
how the science works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like dosage, you know, like I have a
willow bark tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the bark is salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how much bark do I need to boil to
get the right salicylic?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no answer to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: How that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to send a sample in and like run
tests and that costs money, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've always been driven by that
principle to figure that out or like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's just the bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like then you go with the willow shoots
that are more for the cloning solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, what percentage of
indole butyric acid is in the shoots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do you figure out how much you
need to clone, you know, to make like a
[SPEAKER_02]: cloning gel?
[SPEAKER_04]: And at what point in its life does it
possess the most aggressive quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's in the spring months with
the fresh shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, when it's really growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, percentages of the rooting hormone,
IBA.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's essentially like,
I mean, if you want to like drive home an
[SPEAKER_02]: overarching principle, like the plant
medicine healed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm indebted to plant medicine and I want
to figure out how to figure out,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to figure out how to measure it at
like a level for home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone has like a base sort of
analysis of how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like with, like, so,
you know, with the dynamic accumulators
[SPEAKER_02]: like comfrey and yarrow and nettle and
mullet, whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's probably the first main
research science that I conducted where I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, well, let's figure out what
nutrient values of these are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're going to grow them and
then add them to your soil for fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: can you do that successfully with knowing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, it's hard because some of
this is tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tricky part is that there's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ranges of values.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the tricky part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's very similar to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can grow the same cultivar region
a region, you know, from one valley to the
[SPEAKER_03]: next.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to see those differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be the exact same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for all herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the alchemy of the
process is that there's like the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that do it are just like artists and sort
of alchemists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it makes it difficult to put a
full 100% stamp of science on plant
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine for that reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because there are just
variances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's uncontrollable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell you if you want to have like
time in your tea for respiratory issues to
[SPEAKER_02]: use a tablespoon of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you grow it in depleted soil and it
doesn't have the same concentrations of
[SPEAKER_02]: essential oils, maybe you need two
tablespoons to get the right dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just that's like this like unknown or
the same with like the dynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest pushback I've had with the
dynamic accumulators are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you can't really use that as a value
because the soil, they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulate nutrients differently in
different soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on a lot of factors,
what's in the soil, what fungus is in the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, what bacteria is in the soil,
what's liberating those items and making
[SPEAKER_04]: them plant available, those interactions
between, you know, microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_04]: inert chemistry and the plant all make
such a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what it's really hard to drive
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying at least with the dynamic
accumulators to provide, I think I've
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten to a decent framework of
understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have this, I use Sam at Soil Escape
and I did some tests a number of years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have these MPK values and I have like
the main values of their spikes of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even silica, potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what I did was is that Dr. Duke
has this guy, Dr. Duke created the
[SPEAKER_02]: ethnobotanical database.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys ever heard of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a US department of agricultural
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy, Dr. Duke did a long time ago and
it's a huge giant database of
[SPEAKER_02]: phytochemistry of like plant chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: He created this like huge database of
like, I don't even know how many hundreds
[SPEAKER_02]: or thousands of different plant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a lot of the different
chemicals like the terpenes or the esters
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever other plant compounds there
are.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it also has nutrient values to
the best of his ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's missing gaps, but there's quite a
bit of data that he's collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been taking the data that I've
aggregated and comparing them with his
[SPEAKER_02]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'll look on the website and see
like, okay, his comfrey says yada,
[SPEAKER_02]: yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll be like, my comfrey says
this, this, this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's like sort of the correlation?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the statistical correlation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can post it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm actually impressed how much
overlap there is with nutrient spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for mine, like potassium will be like
70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70,000, which will be really high because
well, it was just grown in soils with a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but his will still be 30,000,
you know, in the baselines, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like 10 PPM, you know, like it's like,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like relative spikes between
all of the nutrients that are higher in
[SPEAKER_02]: all the main groups of accumulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, it's, it's, it's cool for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like a clear correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, well maybe it's not
sucking up like a ton, ton, you're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to get an exact value,
but you're of like say potassium,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know that comfrey is going to have
a high overall high level of potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow it and add it, apply it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, some, I'm trying to
establish some baseline, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of that, you know, if I can, that would be
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to write a book about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I'm really interested to
start taking a look at some of this data
[SPEAKER_04]: and see the relationships in these
accumulators between related nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: like magnesium, calcium, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all have such a unique and integral
link together, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they bond at the same sites within
the plant roots and kind of cancel each
[SPEAKER_04]: other or prevent each other from taking up
nutrients and, you know, reaching peak
[SPEAKER_04]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just, and then, you know,
it's like, because also I'm just saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, but it's like,
we got tons of land people, there's fields
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how difficult would it be to just
like plant a field of comfrey and just go
[SPEAKER_02]: out and harvest it for fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like free, just take it and dry
it and powder it and just like add it to
[SPEAKER_02]: your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I'm just saying, it's not
necessarily, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it just seems like a free,
free source of fertilizer potentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, potentially such a deep root system
that pulls roots or pulls nutrients from
[SPEAKER_04]: down and elevates them to the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's someone once explained to me,
Casey.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check out an earlier episode of
Royal Grown Radio with Casey from Phoenix
[SPEAKER_04]: Rising Farms up in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got these comfrey plants that his
family, have been in his family for like
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 or a hundred years or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from the Carolinas, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: How wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, strain and he's been propagating
and his family has been passing it down
[SPEAKER_04]: and his explanation and I've heard it
other ways is it's job is to pull those
[SPEAKER_04]: deep rooted nutrients that shallow rooted
plants can't access and it pulls them up
[SPEAKER_04]: to the top and you chop it and drop it and
it creates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nutrient cycling through the layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing I could see like
over time, if you're like continuously
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting a field, you might start
depleting all of the nutritive values.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe over time you'd lose some of the
concentrations of plant fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I like I plant my comfrey next to my
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bocking 14, but I got from Flying
Blue Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Rita and the Flying Blue Dog
ladies in Willow Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a big herbal farm, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten a ton of herbs from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy a lot of starts in them every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she gave me some starts of this
bocking 14, which is a clumping comfrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't spread like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing next to my compost pile,
it's about the size of this table.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been like that for about four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just like mines the all the
nutrients that might get leached out under
[SPEAKER_02]: the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just like mines that and just chop it
and put it back in the compost pile for
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all of these concepts are
millennia's old, but the understanding is
[SPEAKER_04]: new.
[SPEAKER_04]: The depth of the understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability to test the nutrients,
to isolate these nutrients and to start to
[SPEAKER_04]: do the sort of research that you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fresh thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't had the science at our
fingertips to be like, I've got a tissue
[SPEAKER_04]: sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know exactly what's in this
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually at the same time going to
take a soil sample and know what's exactly
[SPEAKER_04]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know what the plant's taking up,
what it's utilizing, what it's leaving
[SPEAKER_04]: behind and why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you go to, say, Earth Fort and do
a bio biological assay and you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, well, look, I've got all this
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: My plant can't take it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm missing these nitrogen cycling pieces
from my biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, it's just one example of
ways that modern science is giving us the
[SPEAKER_04]: why behind things that people have
observed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Observational science for millennia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now would be the time to plug,
if there's any really rich philanthropists
[SPEAKER_02]: out there, let's start a research science
laboratory here in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we can study all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really want to get into it,
I'll be the lead scientist to run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll just start testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really would be the dream to just
have like a research science laboratory
[SPEAKER_02]: where you test all this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it would be dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like with the chrysanthemum flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what perithrum comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, can you just grow
this flower and use it safely?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, could you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Concentrations that aren't harmful to
aquatic life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, could you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's only one way to find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's to like run some research
science on these topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously there are some science
involved in that, you know, for whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously there could be a monetary
value behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a business and some kinds of,
you know, narrative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's all plant based.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I tell people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, like, you guys don't realize
like how much science, cops, plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Theraflu is from star anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aspirin is from willow bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technu, the poison oak treatment is from a
plant called Grindelia, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or gumweed, gumweed is the nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that one growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this huge plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are ever out in the
summertime, it's really dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge yellow, beautiful,
bright yellow flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a sticky, super sticky white
gummy substance that's used.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just make a tincture with it and then
it treats poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it's anti-coragulation meds
like warfarin and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad had to take that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really common these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all from corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was discovered by cows bleeding to
death internally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ate too much clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind is blown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add one to the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's like plants have all
the answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to figure out what those
answers are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't need to rely so much on this
like pharmaceutical matrix for telling us
[SPEAKER_02]: what we need as far as, they're really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to like totally knock it
because they like, when they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: when they, when like, they're really good
for surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really good for technical,
highly technical surgeries.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to internal medicine,
they fail horribly at like with diet and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition and health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they don't, they get an F minus for
that understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I feel like that's a lot to do with
the isolation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're, you're recognizing, oh,
this plant does this, but then you isolate
[SPEAKER_04]: a single component or compound within that
plant and use it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're no longer using a whole plant
medicine that's balanced through millennia
[SPEAKER_02]: of evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just like the problem we're
having with cannabis and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, was that a Pidiolex or, you know,
just like the THC pills that they
[SPEAKER_02]: synthesize.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Marinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Marinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pidiolex I think is, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marinol was the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hoped that was going to be the answer
for any kind of question for medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought that that was just going to
nip it in the bud right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously they were wrong because
there was an entire culture based around
[SPEAKER_03]: it, like no other plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it wasn't an entire 30 years of
black market sales of comfrey and clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so they're, they, and that's where
it's, it's difficult because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: culture, it was, it was market based as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where plant medicines have
always fallen into that for the same
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons where you have big pharma,
you have pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously, you know, the
scientists can zone in on what plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: benefiting a certain ailment or an
illness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, you know, that's where
they're trying to tackle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we tackle this from a monetary
perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, the science is really good for
identifying the compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like without them, we probably wouldn't
know all these compounds in cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: the very good identifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The money to identify the compounds and to
understand how they interact with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when it comes to the
monetization, it gets ruined.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it gets ruined.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing that's happening with
psychedelics right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we all know that there's a power
in psychedelics in it and, and mushrooms
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, and we're creeping down that
road now where so much is still way not
[SPEAKER_03]: understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that mycology and
mushrooms is going to be, I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's as easy to understand and break it
down as, as plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we know that there's a whole
communication language that's happening
[SPEAKER_03]: under the ground that, you know,
it might take us a long time to really
[SPEAKER_03]: truly understand that, you know,
but as you, as we start to see this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry now unfolding around that,
you know, it's got me a little
[SPEAKER_03]: trepidatious about, you know, like how we
do this with such little knowledge when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as getting into the wrong hands
and, and the wrong intentions,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All valid concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and the, the interesting part of
that to me is finding the balance between
[SPEAKER_04]: a plant being illegal or a fungus or
whatever, being completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no research happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, you know, motion forward in
the general populace understanding how it
[SPEAKER_04]: benefits humanity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it goes to regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of improving that information,
it becomes stifled in a different way
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's focused in a unique way to,
to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hoarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: The knowledge becomes hoarded to control
the outcomes.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, basically the freedom of the
plant was made criminal or the fungus,
[SPEAKER_04]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it becomes regulated and stifled
on this greater level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, how do we get back to a freedom?
[SPEAKER_04]: Freedom of information and research to
actually get the truth behind these
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds at a larger level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Citizen science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some type of like collective union of,
you know, concerned citizens that pool
[SPEAKER_02]: money to perform independent research,
perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Citizen science.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great segue for me to ask you a
little more about the Cha education
[SPEAKER_04]: platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the entirety of the kind of concept of
that business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us about Cha.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you that don't know what Cha
is, it's Cannabis Horticultural
[SPEAKER_03]: Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cha, C-H-A, colloquially known as Cha,
just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the Cannabis Horticultural
Association was founded in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was founded to essentially create a
platform to promote organic and ecological
[SPEAKER_02]: management for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I built it, it was going to be,
well, it still is, is a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a membership.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sign up to be a member and then you
get access to this database.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's essentially like an online book
that's, I'm able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: populate with new data as it emerges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll admit the last few years have been
rough and I haven't updated it as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: I should.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still contains quite a bit of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still being updated pretty
regularly when I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I really, I see this as a
long, long standing project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I modeled it after the Royal Horticultural
Society because this was an association or
[SPEAKER_02]: society that has been around for a hundred
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's for promoting plant
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hadn't seen anything like this in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to create something that was
unique and something that meant,
[SPEAKER_02]: meant something to me in terms of what
type of world I want to see exist in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future for my kids, which is, you know,
organic or ecological or regenerative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just like label it one of those
words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started leaning towards ecological
because other words are loaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people, you know, always like,
oh, well, organic is like just a USD label
[SPEAKER_02]: or regenerative.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a subjective thing and it's hard to
quite pin that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, all that aside, I created it
to do just that, which is educate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And promote these, these concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully as this association grows,
I'll be able to have more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: research money where I can actually
conduct more and more research science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's really what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to set this up to be like the
consumer reports for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, we can like test products and
be like, okay, like let's test Dr. Earth's
[SPEAKER_02]: powder versus green, you know,
what's the other company I can remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's just like test like friendly
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's like test these products out
and like test them out against each other
[SPEAKER_02]: and see how they perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like do side by sides and have
like, you know, research science or like,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's see what happens if, you know,
a plant gets infested with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like can we, how do we treat it with,
let's see about this persimilis mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it withstand Bavaria bassiana as well
if we have this aphid problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like try to test some of the
like the more complex science behind bio
[SPEAKER_02]: merging, bio controls in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'd like to see longterm
with this, you know, this business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an enduring tribute to the,
you know, grander scheme of the plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And personally, that really speaks to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a lot of the research and development
for Royal gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's always about accelerating the
knowledge and changing the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no need or desire to try and do
what other people are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's find a new way to do it differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily better, not necessarily
worse, but let's do it different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's find different ways to create new
expressions of the plant and to feed the
[SPEAKER_04]: biology and the entirety of, you know,
the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we optimize plant growth with the
combination of biology and chemistry?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Very succinctly put.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at the cannabis industry
already in the last 15 or 20 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: the way we've figured out how to grow
cannabis definitely has definitely opened
[SPEAKER_03]: up some eyes in big ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, that's another thing like another
window in the cannabis is open,
[SPEAKER_02]: not identifying pesticides, herbal
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just practice biological practices,
ways to streamline nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another win for biology.
Period.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, big ag, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've just.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a world that they really weren't
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of decades ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're freaking killing soil,
producing cardboard plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another system of control.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you kill everything off and destroy the
cycling, then you become dependent on the
[SPEAKER_04]: supplier to put new available form of this
nutrient back in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's essentially control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that that biological
feedback loop keeps forcing larger and
[SPEAKER_04]: larger consumption of nitrate,
nitrates, nitrogens, potassium,
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just triggered a very deep level of
awareness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond, because I had thought about that
in terms of the human aspect, but I did
[SPEAKER_02]: not consider that for the earth aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's creating this interesting merging
of awareness.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and tie it back to fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are all of the nitrogen sources
coming from for commercial agriculture?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the depth, the depth timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to shut it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm on airplane mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's my take the laundry out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still haven't shut it off from the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, lucky you, you're not pulling tarps
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that was the alarm to be like,
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept it on just like you made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a victory alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Victory alarm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a drink and relax and just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I hear you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all that nitrogen is coming out of
the fossil fuel industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blue nitrogen coming from natural gas
refinement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's so ubiquitous, you know,
go to this, you know, fertilizer
[SPEAKER_04]: conference every year, APTCO.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, the Association of
Fertilizer Producers, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sitting down at these meetings,
you know, because it helps us understand
[SPEAKER_04]: how to label products and create new
products within the system that's allowed
[SPEAKER_04]: and ways to label and create new things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just standing there sitting and you
see the lobbying happening in these
[SPEAKER_04]: meetings for blue nitrogen and for fossil
fuel products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see the kind of behind the scenes
workings manipulating the regulation
[SPEAKER_04]: bodies to lean towards these types of
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just fascinating to me coming
from a world of, you know, fighting
[SPEAKER_04]: against these systems and then going and
sitting in these meetings and being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, my God, it's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real it's like an idea until you're
actually there watching it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a conspiracy theory until you see it
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People always often joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard some rapper recently is like
joking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like people always like talk about
conspiracy theories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like there's unions all the time
working, you know, lobbyists working to
[SPEAKER_02]: like conspire to create rules and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not that outside the scope of
reality to consider how much conspiring
[SPEAKER_02]: actually occurs.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a joke if you think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think, you know,
associations, foundations, collaborations
[SPEAKER_04]: like the Cannabis Horticultural
Association play such an important role
[SPEAKER_04]: like some of these enduring bodies that
are kind of feeding the concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got to, I just got to, I got to
bear down and like I've been in my little
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble, like metaphorically, like building
the root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I think we're ready to like grow
and go, you know, on the national level
[SPEAKER_02]: and they need to figure out a way to
probably create like chapters,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in each state, probably
something like that's been rattling around
[SPEAKER_02]: in the subconscious and figure out who's
going to run the chapters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that way we can pull resources
and collectively build, if I could do
[SPEAKER_02]: that, we could collectively build the
information on the website and it will
[SPEAKER_02]: grow significantly faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to, I need to figure out a
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, coming down to Humboldt,
obviously, you know, we've always been
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of the leaders in, in cannabis,
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, we just got,
we saw you down at the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Emerald Cup was, it was a
testament to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like there were growers from all
over the country and so many of these new
[SPEAKER_03]: states that have gone legal and changed
their laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of enjoyed and was,
I adored the idea that some, so many of
[SPEAKER_03]: them felt the need to come Humboldt and to
tap in to be like, you know, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we're going to do this here in New York
or Missouri or something like where else
[SPEAKER_03]: to go than to tap in to Humboldt County,
Northern California, Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_03]: and talk to growers and talk to some of
the companies that have been around since
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning and the network.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and also to feel the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that there's a big part
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody in every new state is an MSO
looking for, for the next best,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, publicly traded cannabis
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them are getting into it in their
state and really wanting it to be a part
[SPEAKER_03]: of the old cannabis culture that we've had
here for 40 or 50 years, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think there's no place then the
Emerald Cup in a lot of ways to go and a
[SPEAKER_03]: tap into that and experience that and see
what it's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the industry is, you know,
it's not at its best right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: market wise, especially, and people are
struggling, but you wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily known that or felt that at the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was pretty vibrant this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was rainbows and unicorns for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year was a bit like shaky,
but this year I talked to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like way more stable sales were
up at least from some reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, overall it seems
like good rebound so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Humboldt is the epicenter of this
whole explosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the micro, the route,
the fungal network that like sporulates
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole Pacific, I shouldn't
just say Humboldt because I got friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the Pacific Northwest from
British Columbia to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the micro belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even down to Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monterrey, Madisonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monterrey's definitely got some great old
school grades down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to single out because then
you get people, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like more of a metaphor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I obviously favorite favoritism to
the place where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole sort of band along the Pacific
Northwest is this like epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Humboldt almost is like this
because we're near the Redwoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like maybe the center of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we were obviously pushing out the
majority of the weight that was going out
[SPEAKER_03]: to the rest of the world for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo and Trinity were in there and
obviously you can do, you can throw
[SPEAKER_03]: Monterrey and Sonoma and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Southern Oregon, you know, but weight
wise, I don't think anybody, that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: even a debate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Humboldt was definitely kicking
out the majority of the weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and people recognize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I, yeah, I remember going back
to Virginia 10 years ago and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, where are you from?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Oh, you know,
just immediately it's like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't have to say anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just said Humboldt and it was like,
Oh, weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like known.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People stop you on the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have Humboldt on your hat or your
shirt and they're like, Oh, Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_03]: huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made in Humboldt on the back of our
shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you how many times I was at a
restaurant somewhere out way far from this
[SPEAKER_03]: place and somebody would come up to the
restaurant and see the back of my shirt
[SPEAKER_03]: and have to ask me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one thing that kind of
drives me crazy and I'm not trying to take
[SPEAKER_02]: direct shots, but the Humboldt tourism
board needs to get their heads together
[SPEAKER_02]: and recognize that this community is going
to benefit from cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's this problem and they just
need to recognize that they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporate the cannabis community and not
ostracize them for some perception of some
[SPEAKER_02]: old way of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's plenty of old people here
that also support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just heard, you know, I've heard that
they're not very friendly to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't really started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, you know, I mean, you think at this
one, what are we five, five years past?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sixty four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just about three, four years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been talking about that
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was talk about, you know,
cannabis farm tours and the bus that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: up the hill and takes you to three farms
on one hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and it hasn't really happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could just make an ad like show the
redwoods in the in Patrick's Point and
[SPEAKER_02]: like smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to Humboldt and just get really high
grade weed from the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a good vacation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you can tap it into some
culinary stuff with the Avenue of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Giants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seafood with the ocean and just
like, oh man, it would be so easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really feel like so many farms and
mom and pop people that would have
[SPEAKER_04]: survived this falling out of the cannabis
industry didn't because people haven't
[SPEAKER_04]: acted fast enough on some of these
concepts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people that had, you know,
a small greenhouse, but extensive gardens
[SPEAKER_04]: and produced most of their own food who
aren't growing cannabis anymore because
[SPEAKER_04]: they just can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They lost their licenses, didn't get the
license, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've as a community in a large way turned
our back on the heritage that these people
[SPEAKER_04]: brought us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has affected their ability to hold
on and contribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot to say about that,
actually, maybe in as few words but,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there are certain members of the
community, you know, in positions of power
[SPEAKER_02]: or influence that, you know, always even
just community members always,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they ripped the Humboldt
community because of these grow dozers and
[SPEAKER_02]: hill grows and like big money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just like spending money and
then leaving and going to Costa Rica,
[SPEAKER_02]: which did exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they didn't realize is that
there's actually a proportionately much
[SPEAKER_02]: higher number of growers that are just
families.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're community members that are
serving the fire departments and the local
[SPEAKER_02]: soccer leagues and the local community
centers and the businesses and the
[SPEAKER_02]: schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're donating their volunteer time
to all of these organizations that are
[SPEAKER_02]: fueling our social network.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so and the problem also then existed
in the permitting regulations where a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of them lived on pieces of land that
weren't able to get these permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have set up some type of
variance permitting that allowed like
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors to agree or, you know,
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should have been a better permitting
system for small scale cultivators in
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, having some type of
collective, you know, group of them come
[SPEAKER_02]: together might have been a better
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes from years of everybody not
necessarily, you know, working as a unit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for the longest time, even if
you're friends with your neighbors on the
[SPEAKER_03]: hill, you know, you still, for the most
part, you'd keep your distance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't necessarily want to tie in or
be too close to the neighbor because you
[SPEAKER_03]: never know what's going to happen with
that neighbor or who the workers that they
[SPEAKER_03]: were going to have over that year or maybe
they're going to get busted and lead over
[SPEAKER_03]: to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was still a very,
you know, private, you know, doing my
[SPEAKER_03]: thing over here, you know, and that's
tough because we needed so much more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: cooperative relationship with everybody
right out of the gates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think because it was every man for
themselves, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we didn't have the voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The voice putting that towards the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wanted to talk because they were
all scared to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get abated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're who?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's your abatement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's a systemic and systematic
oppression by separating and dividing the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that created the culture to try and
keep them from growing enough to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: ascend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it got past the point of no
return, then it was regulated in a way
[SPEAKER_04]: that kept them out of the new system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really basically set up the failure
of all of these farms and it's limiting
[SPEAKER_04]: the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's limiting the community and it's
allowing big money and big agriculture to
[SPEAKER_04]: take over what community created.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really sad and baffling,
but I think we do have a voice and we do
[SPEAKER_04]: have a way to continue to grow this
community and to bring it back and change
[SPEAKER_04]: culturally from the inside out these
systems that tried to oppress it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a positive outlook and I
fully support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sure not going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but we have to work together and
that's the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now we're a tight enough unit that
we're like, so when I went to this showing
[SPEAKER_02]: of Tending the Garden, that movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad I missed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was put on by Claire and Jesse and
those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in that theater, it was really
interesting because a lot of those people
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew and some of them I had never met
before, but it was a giant family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically if you are here now,
we're a family and we're here to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter who you are or what our
differences have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you made it this far, we're here to
network together and provide resources and
[SPEAKER_02]: pool resources and share information and
figure out a way we can make this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like from the small scale farm,
that's where we're at in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's here to just band together now
at this point against the big corporates.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to Jesse about the event and
the way you just described it really
[SPEAKER_04]: summed up what he was saying in a whole
different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like, I don't know, it was a really
cool connection.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've made it this far, we can make it the
rest of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish there was a way to lock in some of
the funds that have been allocated to
[SPEAKER_03]: helping Humboldt County in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of funds out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it's been used in Sacramento to
keep in state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't gotten anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably half the counties in
California that still really don't allow
[SPEAKER_03]: any cannabis or dispensaries or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The outdoor market in the major cities in
San Francisco and LA, it's always been
[SPEAKER_03]: favorable towards indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way out is to go out of state.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be allowed to sell your product
throughout the entire rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible to secure some of those
funds and actually have a lobby?
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying that every industry has
got a lobby and they're all making these
[SPEAKER_03]: deals.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what the Emerald Triangle
needs, but it has to go to Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's the only way forward is
to be able to, because this flower is
[SPEAKER_03]: completely in high demand for the rest of
the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just suffering here in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to figure out, get the group
together, and then you have to figure out,
[SPEAKER_02]: because collectively it would be nice,
but probably still low on the monetary end
[SPEAKER_02]: of influence, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'd have to figure out some type of
incentive.
[SPEAKER_02]: What incentive are you going to give to
the congressmen?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have this app that, if
downloaded, then we'll allow interstate
[SPEAKER_02]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you a percentage of the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the stupid way congress works.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's like play the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to play the game, figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pay to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that, if that had
happened even just a couple years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: as all these new states go illegal,
it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of them don't have any kind of
history in cultivating themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could still probably allow a home-grow
as part of your legislation that passes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but for the actual overall populist market
of each of these states, right up into
[SPEAKER_03]: places like New York, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could probably just go out,
open up dispensers everywhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: and not really even have a cultivation
part of the bill, knowing that you could
[SPEAKER_03]: be supplied from a place like California,
whether it's indoor greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: light debt, and indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could take care of you in New York and
all the other states too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're still illegal when you can't
go over state lines, every state that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: legal has no choice but to set up an
entire brand new infrastructure on
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it would be nice to tap interstate
commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, it's crazy,
like 50 plus percent of the counties in
[SPEAKER_02]: California don't allow retail sales.
Anything.
Anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a crazy thing, especially how big
California is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a good- 29 counties,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who just passed that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Beard Bros, they had a news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about some senator tacking on
interstate commerce little blip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys remember that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I must have missed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Oregon's pushing for it pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like a blip in a congressional
bill about allowing interstate commerce
[SPEAKER_02]: for small farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was Mike McGuire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was some senator, a
representative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find it for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure there was some little blip
that got it like a writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love that if McGuire did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, no, I'll find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure like something- Oops,
did I do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a very deep conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a long way to go here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to propose we take a quick
break.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fire one up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you who know at home,
the conversation gets a little looser once
[SPEAKER_04]: we start blazing and we'll be back in just
a few minutes to delve a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: deeper.
