[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am finally back from southern Humboldt
from receiving my ganja Certification and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm just here with the the catfish
tester group Weighing in on my catfish
[SPEAKER_00]: thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at like eight nine weeks of veg And
I've been keeping things pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started out in like little solo cups
I moved them up to half gallons and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're finally in the two gallons where
they'll finish It's been like maybe five
[SPEAKER_00]: days Since I transplanted into the two
gallons and this is the growth that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten from the catfish thus far that one
in the far back is One of the last catfish
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you know, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a different variety but as you
can see The catfish is rather uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of some height differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some shorter Pheno types here in the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like And then the taller ones in
the back And we've just been really
[SPEAKER_00]: running with them they managed to stay
healthy You know, this tent is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit overcrowded So I am having to do some
foliars just to make sure I'm on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything things are like spray There's
an actual IPM regiment going on Just with
[SPEAKER_00]: neem oil and the FPE the fermented plant
extracts that I use But for the most part
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's looking healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm Just getting back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my first update myself and the
rest of the tent I have again some Kim dog
[SPEAKER_00]: special reserve from Peter some Kim D
rainbow belts That I've been running,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pretty much, you know I've been
running the rainbow belts cross dag on
[SPEAKER_00]: there every time I've popped seeds So
these are right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we move and shift over here,
we've got the Hollywood the Hollywood TKM
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also from Daga dot Love shout out
to Peter Here up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the Moses and you know,
this little one was root bound when I
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted and I just Decided to try to
transplant it up to see if it would go
[SPEAKER_00]: It's struggling clearly, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are probably going to get that one out
of there This is this whole Moses Platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush line has been fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they went root bound pretty early I've
been really trying to figure them out But
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the fun of running a whole bunch of
varieties and cultivars, even though most
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are somewhat related in some
regards These have been giving me the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest time though as you can see We got
the comfort food over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cat sue And again, we got some mass
medical og Kush by prayer glue And now the
[SPEAKER_00]: star of the show are definitely probably
the TK the Hollywood TKM 10 and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: got the catfish Really proud of these
Happy and excited to see the flower got a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of different phenos as of right now
But you know, we'll see how they express
[SPEAKER_00]: once we flip on the flower.
