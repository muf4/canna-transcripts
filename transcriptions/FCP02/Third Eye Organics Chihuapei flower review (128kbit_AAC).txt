[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, this is OG Is My
Oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pax of the Future here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're here to talk about some
third eye organics, which we are both very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pax of the Future can tell you a little
more about third eye organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are a very, very special set of
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think right now, at least in
LA, third eye is more one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators that people are most excited
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are absolutely included.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the pleasure of trying their
Runts, their Sour Dub, their Wookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: their Starburst OG, and now I'll let OG Is
My Oxygen tell you about what we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be trying today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so today we've got the Chihuahuape,
which is a sour diesel slash very berry
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's a very berry Kush,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that is sour diesel cross with
very berry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just opening up the jar and smelling
it, I get a lot of sour and diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: gas, and it's really dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it definitely is strong on the
sour diesel, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so third eye is really considered by
a lot of people, I'd say, to be one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: master cultivators right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of, in a lot of people's
mind, the most exciting smoke going
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the nose and the visual,
you can tell what people are so excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The turf profile is very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a blueberry, like a DJ short
blueberry thing going on, but there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: backbone of like a Hindu Kushiness,
a dark note as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, I kind of get raspberries a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruity berry bouquet is more complex
than you get in a lot of representations
[SPEAKER_01]: of that turf profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was actually able to try some
third eye organics, ogre farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: chihuahua hash rosin, I believe it was
live hash rosin, day before we got these
[SPEAKER_00]: jars, and the turps on that were
incredibly strong, incredibly present,
[SPEAKER_00]: just absolutely tickling the palate and
the nasal cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those dabs that you hit and just,
it completely coats your entire sinus
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity and your entire palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much a full takeover of the
senses when you smoke the chihuahua rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel that way about the chihuahua
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rolled ourselves up a doobie right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to roll the joints thicker rather
than skinnier to get a better flavor on
[SPEAKER_00]: the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how it is, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first impression on the dry puff of
this, I get those raspberries that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get citrus, I get, some more of those
nose tickly, kind of fuely turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they really blend in with the citrus
to me, but it tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes super bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get like raspberry and lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely lime to go with that citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how sometimes at fruit carts on
the street, they'll squeeze lime over the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of that vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like the lime, the lime on the
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the light up cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta use the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love using a torch lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, for me, it works better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people make the unfortunate mistake
of burning the paper a little too much
[SPEAKER_00]: with the torch lighter, and that can
hinder a joint prone to airflow problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, I find this lights at the
best, especially on the fatty joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not using this tech right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third Eye advocates for using the gumless
club paper, which is a super interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: another way to just sort of enhance the
turps even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any thoughts about what
papers we should be using to roll up,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it is end up being the gumless club
paper, we'd be stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're definitely always trying to have
the best smoking experience possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're using our favorite
element papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pass this over.
So
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your first impression off the bat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Having one hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first impression is that the smoke is
getting in my beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, definitely fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: More the diesel than you get in the nose,
I'd say is present in the in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally haven't had the pleasure of
trying all the different sour diesels that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the difference between the
Soma versus the AJ versus the the East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is that petrily, fuely quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a nice berry element as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost tastes like a strawberry soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very sour and sweet and definitely
fuely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very terpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to go in and maybe have something
more articulate to say in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely get that diesel in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly to when I hit the rosin,
hitting the joint definitely coats the
[SPEAKER_00]: palate with the diesel type turps,
first and foremost, letting the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of settle into my palate after
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after having exhaled as well,
I definitely caught notes of the
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries that we were getting earlier
in our dry puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the diesel and the lime kind
of play into each other in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tickle your palate turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you smoke it, it becomes it becomes
kind of a nice synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think as the flavor is
starting to wash over me more and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a better sense of it, I haven't
had a pleasure of trying a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruity hash plant strains that people are
excited about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of them are coming from
Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: This to me is what I'd imagine like the
raspberry hash plant would taste like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a deep, rich, dank, diesel-y for
sure, but also just hash-y, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: A flavor that I'm enjoying a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with Third Eye, we did roll up a nice
size joint here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can get away with rolling
pinners because this is some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: strongest, the strongest weed around in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that hash-y,
resinous flavor makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they're growing this plant
really for excellent resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A term that we like to throw around is
keef on a leaf and this is no keef on a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're both, you know, spending more time
hitting it than we are talking,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I'm about to get super,
super stoned, but at the moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really just feeling a light body high,
like a light sort of sedative thing coming
[SPEAKER_01]: over my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm definitely starting to feel a bit
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say the primary feeling for me is also
in my shoulders, which is interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: like along this part of my shoulders on
both sides, and then also like in my kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of back of my jaw area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weed for me is, you know,
very much behind the eyes and the forehead
[SPEAKER_00]: and the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I really feel in my shoulders and
in my jaw compared to that in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate kind of noticeable effects and
effect points.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both starting to draw a little bit,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you're getting weed
that is of this quality, for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part, I'd say the people that have the
pleasure of smoking third, I really did
[SPEAKER_01]: have to seek it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you sort of go through that
effort to get your hands on a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want it to be this immediately
impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the cool things about almost
all of the weed I've smoked from third eye
[SPEAKER_00]: is it feels very euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes weed for me can have an edgy
feeling or sometimes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people might describe that as getting
too high or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is very euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: More like being like wrapped in a warm
blanket than being like shocked in the
[SPEAKER_00]: face with some crazy, you know,
foreign sensations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like, to sum it up,
just very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychedelic without being panicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that while we both do feel this
thing on our shoulders and with it having
[SPEAKER_01]: the very, very cush in it, you would
expect there to be sort of a relaxing,
[SPEAKER_01]: sedative profile, but there also is this
cerebral buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do feel not energized, but very
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I resonate with that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that anyone who has the
opportunity to go out and get third eye
[SPEAKER_01]: organics, it is a treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of really amazing growers
that are operating at this high of a
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if you can try it,
try all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly the third eye is very
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third eye is indoor organic living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, you know, the weed speaks
for itself, but we can only do so much to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate the experience of trying third
eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky enough to try these terps,
I'd say go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always really appreciative that you
were willing to check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping to bring some cool
concentrates to the review table soon,
[SPEAKER_01]: but until then, you know, smoke well and
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody.
