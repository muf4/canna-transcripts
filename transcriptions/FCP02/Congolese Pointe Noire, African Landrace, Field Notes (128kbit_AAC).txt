sativa is everything's getting Charging
[SPEAKER_00]: and lots of flowers going on, but this one
is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so elegant and African and long
leaves So this is a Congo Congolese Point
[SPEAKER_00]: noir, which I'm guessing means black point
So this is one of the Congolese we're

stem, but this one and the seeds were
[SPEAKER_00]: really tough to germinate So I only have
one female going Right now we had two
[SPEAKER_00]: other males that we said bye to but anyway
very cool structure these long elegant
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves and when it the wind blows the
whole plant just really dances,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just a Gorgeous so such a unique
beautiful plant and it it actually kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Whispers as it's blowing and the leaves it
makes this cool a little whispering noise
[SPEAKER_00]: so anyway But this probably has It's
October 23rd today.
