[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you wake up, and you feel like you
need a little up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're down and out, and you need to
get a little higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you need a blessing,
and you feel a little high today,
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to the Church of Cali High.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali High.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali High.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Cali High, Episode 61,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Cenzo Nico, also known as
Vince Nicoletti.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this week, we have a special holiday
episode for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica is the first in a new series of
retrospectives called, A Work in Progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a story of my search for
Rastafarians and their herb, and what
[SPEAKER_02]: really happened, and the lessons learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is a true story, and is
dedicated to the memory of Joe Frank,
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard Hirschman, and Reifert Ward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Jamaica when I was 18 in 1975.
[SPEAKER_02]: My oldest brother, Chris, my music mentor
and fellow cannabis enthusiast,
[SPEAKER_02]: had told me about a people called
Rastafarians who smoked herb as part of
[SPEAKER_02]: their religion.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also briefly mentioned someone named
Bob Marley, a Jamaican magician who would
[SPEAKER_02]: be in town soon, and Chris was going to
see him at the Roxy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, it was approaching the second
summer after I finished high school,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had some money after selling
high-grade Colombian herb that whole year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hearing my brother's story of the
Rastafarians in Jamaica, I bought myself a
[SPEAKER_02]: round-trip ticket, and early in July,
flew to Montego Bay, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a cab from the airport, and found an
old hotel which had once been a colonial
[SPEAKER_02]: mansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all white, and the rooms were
sparkly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a certain stuffiness about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had hardwood floors, and there was a
weird vibe to the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The room was so sparsely furnished,
there was just a bed, and one small
[SPEAKER_02]: bedside table.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a balcony that opened onto a
view of the expansive lawn that spread out
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of the mansion, to a view of the
bay off to the west, and the Caribbean to
[SPEAKER_02]: the north.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mid-afternoon in July, and after
depositing my things in my room,
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to go find some Jamaican herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walking down the hotel's driveway to the
street, I found girls calling out to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: and dealers trying to sell weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked one to get me some herb,
and he said we had to get a cab and go up
[SPEAKER_02]: into the hills to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a cab, and we drove up the winding
streets into the hills of Montego Bay,
[SPEAKER_02]: near a botanical garden surrounded by a
little shantytown and a few shops and lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of people just hanging out in doorways on
the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hopped out of the cab in front of the
botanical garden, and immediately my guide
[SPEAKER_02]: told me to walk 20 feet behind him,
and as we walked, all eyes were on me,
[SPEAKER_02]: the only white guy around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a new experience for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a bit of a walk, he told me to wait
by the garden, and he went in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not long after, he emerged with a small
brown bag filled with somewhat dried
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was July, and there were no buds yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too early in the season and too late from
the one before, and it was then that I
[SPEAKER_02]: found out you couldn't buy rolling papers
in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, cannabis was illegal in Jamaica at
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember taking a cab back to the hotel
by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told I could roll up a spliff and a
bit of paper from a thin paper bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I didn't relish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was beginning to wonder why I hadn't
brought a bud or two of my Colombian and a
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of zigzags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back at my hotel, I rolled up some leaves
and some paper from a small thin white
[SPEAKER_02]: paper bag, and as I took a few puffs,
realized my room was in no way airtight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That night in the dining room of the
hotel, I met a tourist couple in their
[SPEAKER_02]: twenties from South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had rented a car, and tomorrow they
were driving to the west end of the island
[SPEAKER_02]: to a place called Negril, where there were
tropical beaches and fun in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked me if I wanted to go with them,
and I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured they wanted another guy from
security and I was cool with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely, Montego Bay wasn't what I had
imagined Jamaica to be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day, we were on the way out of
Montego Bay, driving down the palm-lined
[SPEAKER_02]: coast above volcanic rock cliffs and white
sand beaches to Negril.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had dreams of that drive for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was my first trip out of the country,
and I learned two important things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: would take away for future travels.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, the countryside has friendlier people
than the big city usually, and two,
[SPEAKER_02]: traveling by yourself allows you to
experience a destiny that is 100% your
[SPEAKER_02]: own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the names of the couple
that drove me to Negril, but I am grateful
[SPEAKER_02]: for their help in getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Negril has a long coconut palm-clad beach
which gradually fades into cliffs of
[SPEAKER_02]: volcanic rock as West End Road heads west
and then turns south at the west end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rented myself a canvas tent under the
coconut palms on the white sands of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Negril Yacht Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest yacht there was a dugout log
that was fashioned into a canoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the Negril Yacht Club, West End Road
was dirt and continued west for about a
[SPEAKER_02]: mile past the Awimaway Lodge, named after
the song, The Lion Sleeps Tonight,
[SPEAKER_02]: which had little wooden huts for rent,
and from there, the road went up away and
[SPEAKER_02]: turned south.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there I found Rick's Cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick's Cafe was clearly named after Rick's
Cafe American, Humphrey Bogart's club in
[SPEAKER_02]: the movie Casablanca.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an open-air tropical bar just set
back from the cliffs 35 feet above the
[SPEAKER_02]: Caribbean Sea below.
[SPEAKER_02]: An oval bar with a palm-thatched roof and
no walls, which had a spectacular view of
[SPEAKER_02]: the sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were tourists sipping pina coladas
and drinking red stripes while enjoying
[SPEAKER_02]: the view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just south of the bar was a miniature cove
where people were jumping and diving from
[SPEAKER_02]: the cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were regulars at Rick's,
and one was the diver who clearly stood
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing pipe two-and-a-halfs into the
water below.
[SPEAKER_02]: During my time in Negril, I went from
timidly jumping first feet from that cliff
[SPEAKER_02]: to pulling off one-and-a-halfs in tandem
with the diver guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on the gymnastics team in high
school, and one of my teammates had had a
[SPEAKER_02]: diving board where we practiced dives,
and so I knew how to dive but had never
[SPEAKER_02]: dived from a 35-foot cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main character at the bar was Rick
himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard Hirschman was an ex-patriot
American from New York who had settled in
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica and enjoyed his days snorkeling in
front of the cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We became friends and ended up knowing
each other for a few years after that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and eventually I lost touch with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick had a certain world-weariness about
him and wasn't far from a tropical version
[SPEAKER_02]: of Bogart's character, Rick Blaine,
except for the philanthropic movement of
[SPEAKER_02]: refugees and he didn't run guns,
although I did meet him the next year in
[SPEAKER_02]: Miami for 35 pounds of Colombian,
but that is another story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back at my tent that first day in Negril,
I met a 40-year-old Rastafarian who hung
[SPEAKER_02]: out at the Negril Yacht Club whose name
was Reeford Ward.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some herb, mostly leaves,
and a small battery-powered cassette
[SPEAKER_02]: player.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had only one cassette, and it was
Naughty Dread by Bob Marley and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Whalers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked leaves in my tent as the sun was
going down, and I listened to reggae for
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reeford put on side two first,
so Josse started playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The music had an instant effect on me,
the funky percussion, the horns,
[SPEAKER_02]: the guitar, and Bob singing, I and I,
I know Lego, and where I am, I shall
[SPEAKER_02]: abide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was exotic to my ears and gave me a
good feeling, a feeling of honor and hope
[SPEAKER_02]: and culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a profound moment, and even I knew
it at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob singing about Jamaica, and me looking
at Reeford Ward's two-foot-long dreads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dissa dreadlock, he said as the song
playing referenced the word.
[SPEAKER_02]: The music gave me a somewhat enlightened
and encapsulated cultural perspective
[SPEAKER_02]: about Jamaica, Reeford Ward, and reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was Bob Marley singing,
cold ground was my bed last night,
[SPEAKER_02]: and rock was my pillow too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a seminal moment in my life,
a milestone, and a great influence on me
[SPEAKER_02]: musically speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I would eventually go home,
I would end up turning all my friends onto
[SPEAKER_02]: reggae and Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Naughty Dread became my soundtrack to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reeford Ward and I became friends,
and we listened to Naughty Dread whenever
[SPEAKER_02]: we were together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reeford was a vegetarian and cooked his
own food, which consisted mostly of
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable eye-tall soup, because he had
lost most of his teeth from lack of dental
[SPEAKER_02]: care.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day we went on a trip up into the
hills of Westmoreland, and after hiking up
[SPEAKER_02]: a steep jungle-clad slope, we came to a
clearing, and there, surrounded by the
[SPEAKER_02]: jungle, was Reeford's grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was July.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the six-foot-tall ganja plants only
had leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corn was growing around the ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started a fire and roasted some corn
and leaves to dry, and smoked them and ate
[SPEAKER_02]: the corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afterwards, we stopped by his mom's house
somewhere in the rolling hills of
[SPEAKER_02]: Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He introduced me to his mom, and she
served us lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, we took a bus back to Negril.
[SPEAKER_02]: The road was lined with tall grasses,
and the sun was in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: West End Road between Wicks Cafe and the
Negril Yacht Club became a daily walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the mango vendor that would
push a cart up and down the road singing
[SPEAKER_02]: out, mongos, sweet and juicy mongos.
[SPEAKER_02]: He indeed had sweet and juicy mangoes,
and I bought many from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while, I stayed at the Elwema Way
Lodge on West End Road, which had teeny
[SPEAKER_02]: wooden huts that were barely a step up
from my canvas tent at the Negril Yacht
[SPEAKER_02]: Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bermuda grass grew between the huts,
and it was more lively than the yacht
[SPEAKER_02]: club.
[SPEAKER_02]: While there, I met an American guy from
Florida who was a few years older than me
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time, who had overstayed his visa
by six months, and who offered to buy mine
[SPEAKER_02]: for $100.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold it to him because I had a
round-trip ticket and wasn't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: overstay my visa, which was on file,
and so I reasoned I wouldn't need it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also remember driving to the Western
Union office in Westmoreland to wire my
[SPEAKER_02]: mom for money.
[SPEAKER_02]: A week later, I came back to pick up the
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it turned out, Rick was the only guy
around who had any buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a quarter-pound bag of Brown
Columbia Bud Pieces and Shake.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had become friends and regularly
watched the sunset over the West Caribbean
[SPEAKER_02]: while talking about Jamaica, music,
weed, and most interestingly, the bar
[SPEAKER_02]: patrons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One glorious afternoon, the sun was
setting and was halfway down in the water
[SPEAKER_02]: when a pair of jumping dolphins
silhouetted the orange disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also a cute blonde from Florida
who I met at Rick's Cafe and who had taken
[SPEAKER_02]: a fancy to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow, we ended up naked in the shower
back at her hotel, which was the first hot
[SPEAKER_02]: shower I had taken in weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was sharing a room with her
girlfriends and privacy was at a premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was there for the weekend and it was a
short affair.
[SPEAKER_02]: A fond memory, and yet I can't remember
her name.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Jamaican lady who sold
psilocybin mushroom tea from a little
[SPEAKER_02]: stand in the roundabout near the Negril
Yacht Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: She bottled the tea in old rum bottles and
lined them up on the stand's counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: One evening, I bought one from her and
drank it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat on the beach coming on to the tea,
looking north toward Cuba.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a beautiful afternoon and the sun
was setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm from California and I had only
seen wild lightning once in my life from
[SPEAKER_02]: my Uncle Bob's roof in Jacksonville,
Florida when I was in the 10th grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are other contributing factors
to my reactions that evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll address the background of my
psychology later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunset faded to darkness and I started
seeing flashes of light on the horizon to
[SPEAKER_02]: the north.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each flash illuminated giant thunder
clouds and then the thunder clouds morphed
[SPEAKER_02]: into mushroom clouds and then each flash
of light became an atomic bomb flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow, Reefer Ward was with me and I was
telling him, I think the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: is dropping atomic bombs on Cuba.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looked at me as if I was high and then
after a moment of realization,
[SPEAKER_02]: the vision melted back into a thunderstorm
on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reefer Ward and I never spoke after I left
Negril and somehow I would like to thank
[SPEAKER_02]: him after all these years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would be 87 now and of those Jamaicans
I know now, none have any reports of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get a letter from his niece who I
never met saying how she saw me and loves
[SPEAKER_02]: me and will I come back for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: My stay in Jamaica was a life-changing
experience if only for the introduction to
[SPEAKER_02]: reggae.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was so much more magic in my
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has stayed with me all these years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick Hirschman and I exchanged numbers and
a year later he called me from Miami with
[SPEAKER_02]: business and we'll save that for another
story.
Epilogue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reefer Ward taught me many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was how to grow lamb's bread,
which is really a growing technique and
[SPEAKER_02]: not a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Become a Callie High patron right now by
going to patreon.com slash Callie High LA
[SPEAKER_02]: and donating $25 and I will send you the
secret to growing lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you at the $100 level,
I will also send 10 Afghan land-raised
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds for you to practice with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, our fundraising efforts have
fallen on deaf ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we come to you this holiday with an
urgent request.
[SPEAKER_02]: This Christmas, keep the gift that keeps
on giving and be generous so we can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights on here at Callie High.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without your help, there may be no Callie
High because it becomes more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to justify to my wife and kids
why I'm doing interviews and writing
[SPEAKER_02]: stories that no one wants to donate a few
bucks for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Donate now!
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will receive good karma points
that will be redeemable at the pearly
[SPEAKER_02]: gates.
[SPEAKER_02]: St. Peter himself will personally thank
you and you can jump the line straight
[SPEAKER_02]: into heaven without ID.
