[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plant that I showed you all
the other day that I was doing the regrow
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how once we've got some
good growth, we could cut back on all that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of questions about the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to show you a couple
plants that I did at the same time so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of see the difference in pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's important so that you
understand about patience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant has Mexican genetics and
types of high genetics in, so it has
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't breed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Charles Scott's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the equatorial genetics affect the
pace of flowering, how it shifts into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, how it shifts back out of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you take a look, and I call it
determinant, meaning that once these
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones have kicked in to drive the
reproductive process, they want to stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more the northern latitude or
southern latitude, depending on what side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the equator you're on, the further
you're away from the equator, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: determinant the plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular one is kind of plastic
because of that equatorial nature or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 15 latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we come over here, and you can see
this killer hash plant that I created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one is a cherry pie, and I used a
Gosney Afghani as the pollinator for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this is just beginning to pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was on for a smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the plant that Alex and Lena
washed so I could bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this stuff was just foul, I mean,
just screaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see how slow it is,
where this one's already fully developed
[SPEAKER_00]: and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's just initiating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start to see here,
like pull it in, where the bracts are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of open back up, and you can see the color
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says, hey, we're starting to
return to juvenility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go over to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of in between both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a skittle that I used a F3
redleb puck male on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the total sift, all these three
plants, they came out about 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: So six tables of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was by far the best of the redleb
pucks into the skittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was just phenomenal hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I got to capture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the difference in that
shift where this is really beginning to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I start to get some true
development, I'll be able to carve away
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is just beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some signs here where you
can see the color change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it is, for me, with the root,
it's to cut back the root ball a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and then put it into a smaller pot so
I'm not having to constantly up pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want is I want a wet-dry cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like when your crop's staring in a
queue, smaller cubes give you better
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with this is that I want this
to be able to go through a wet-dry cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: so I initiate root stimulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I do is I take the plants,
and if you can see how it's grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see there was another side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I create this V and it lets
me chop half the plant off for the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other half I let hang on to
regrow so I have material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes moderate nitrogen, nothing
excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes sunlight, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could put it outside and then
bring it in at night and stimulate with
[SPEAKER_00]: some extra light so that you keep the
flowering response down and just be
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the huge difference in
speed where this plant is fully vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the mood to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is just starting to break free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's in the process in between
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that, you know,
in a perfect world, we hold clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would have had to pull 300 plugs and
I would have had to hold 300 plugs for a
[SPEAKER_00]: month and a half minimum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I don't even want to take them
when they're flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to deal with it in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just say, you know, full two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 300 plants for two months while we're
flowering 300 plants is just a pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I used to do it when I had the
facility to hold the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that everything's so highly
regulated, you don't get to play some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these games with your own projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went back to just doing
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to work where I allow the plants
that are outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make the selections and I do the smoke
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one looks like holy hell right
now, but my God, this thing was a
[SPEAKER_00]: screamer, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a stunner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the aroma was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mouth was powdered sugar, orange spritzer,
and early finish, just gorgeous
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was by far the best one of that whole
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just by being patient, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically what you end up getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just learn that you just got to
take your time and be patient and allow it
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longest it's ever taken is probably,
I want to say over five months on a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that was so determinant that it
literally stayed almost in stasis for two
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half months where it didn't even
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just was like frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just decided, let's see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, over the course of the
next three months, it emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to pull a copy and we had
a really valuable plant that we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: lost otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of it is just take your time and
make sure that you don't start chopping
[SPEAKER_00]: out too much material because you don't
have enough leaf material here to really
[SPEAKER_00]: drive root health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we start to have enough material,
then we're able to have a healthy bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: end, healthy top end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go into vegetative and now we have
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a great day.
Thank you.
