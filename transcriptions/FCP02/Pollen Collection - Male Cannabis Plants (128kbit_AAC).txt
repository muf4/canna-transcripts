[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going Future Cannabis Project
community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lobster Fam Farms here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm going to be going over my low
tech home grow strategy on collecting male
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen from the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be my first time
intentionally pollinating female cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Necessity is the mother of invention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I'm looking for that doesn't
quite exist yet or that no one else is
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to create.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like a worthwhile goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm looking for is something that's
very flavorful, very energetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's going to be a type 2 variety
that's going to be very rich in minor
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: To anyone making a living off of seeds out
there, it's not my intention to sell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just to learn more about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially it's just going to be something
for me and the squad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it turns out to be something nice and
fun and eventually hopefully it'll make it
[SPEAKER_02]: to patients if it's deemed worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are some of the strategies I set
up and I feel like most people could
[SPEAKER_02]: replicate this in any home environment
that also has a flowering room close by
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you had to use a sheet or just
something simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have this closet door open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the humidifiers crank in,
create this little microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it at 75% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my intention and hope is that anything
that creeps out of here, it's just going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be made non-viable if it does when it
creeps out, not if it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my next step is going to be to use
the pump sprayer and I'm going to spray
[SPEAKER_02]: all around the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive me house, but I'm just going to
drench everything and I'm going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: tune out for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to stage all the stuff I
have to bring in and then we'll rock and
[SPEAKER_02]: roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rock and roll time to creep in here
and creep out all stealth style,
[SPEAKER_02]: bing bang bada boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what's going on in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the temperature and the humidity
temperature is a little bit warm for a
[SPEAKER_02]: normal garden, but I'm more stoked on the
low humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the pollen that I collected
yesterday is going to be good to swoop up
[SPEAKER_02]: in store.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I scored yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a whole lot, but from what I've heard,
a little goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now yesterday I collected this on
parchment paper in the same room that the
[SPEAKER_02]: males are in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I think I can improve this after my
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did was I set the dehumidifier in
this room and after I collected the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen, I tried to spray everything down
and that jacked humidity way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I could be more effective by just
tossing the dehu into the closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping out here very humid, not very
humid, keeping out here as dry as it is
[SPEAKER_02]: now, collecting my pollen in the closet,
closing the closet behind me with the
[SPEAKER_02]: dehumidifier inside there, and then using
my pump sprayer, just spray everything in
[SPEAKER_02]: here down, jack the humidity way up,
spray myself down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my business card, my storage
container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lightly sweep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of soil mixed in there
on the first batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it could be that bad,
as soil is typically found out and about,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not too often in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the female pistols, but I'm
hoping that that little bit of soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: there doesn't make too much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to pack it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like some pollen in the vial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much, but I think it's more than
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to gather some more today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a new setup in the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to bring the plants in here and
shake them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can shake some pollen off.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting about these plants was
that I never flipped them to 12-12.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started showing full male maturity
under 18 hours, and I asked big respect to
[SPEAKER_02]: Sapo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him what the variables could be
for that, and he said it was sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: when inbred lines were vegged too long in
small containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So appreciate the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like both those variables were
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was ensured that the pollen would still
be viable, which is why I'm collecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it's not, good practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some protocols in order,
and if it is sterile, there's no risk to
[SPEAKER_02]: the rest of the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes to jump around the swamp,
but you won't see him a lot, because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might weigh a ton, but you won't see
him none, because he's a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to leave the swamp,
because he really likes his spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might weigh a ton, but you won't see
him none, because he's a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a reclusive moose.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one smells very, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to keep this one separate and
collect the pollen on its own in a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to smooth off any male
flowers because they might contain
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture that will make the pollen
non-viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to be done something now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got everything separated,
all the plant matter out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what pollen I'm left with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a valuable lesson not to do hold
your forehead over it if you're sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little puddle of no good in
there, but work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to leave this here in the
closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set the de-heel on to 40%
humidity, relative humidity, and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to creep out and start spraying
these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're up to 40 and up a little warmer
since I've been up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it won't take too much, but I'm going
to give them a squirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now my logic here is that I can try to
neutralize any pollen that might be left
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plants or in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if any, what does creep out
through the door will be neutralized by
[SPEAKER_02]: the little humidity zone out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, there's a couple more doors and
attempted barriers, but I know this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: finds a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to spray everything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive me room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got everything sprayed down, got the
closet quarantined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sit in here and smoke one,
let the humidity jack up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to take off everything I
wore, put it in a pile and spray that as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any tools that I brought in here that I'm
bringing out, including my cell phone,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give those a spray down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to bring me and all that
stuff right to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the sprayer, even though it was
spraying water, I imagine there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to rinse everything,
including me, right after the humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: gets to about 60, 65 in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I have my little buffer zone out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's right to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start throwing water on everything and
that's going to be too hot for TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll check you guys in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm out of the shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to rinse everything that I brought
back out of the room and dry it off and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe take this time to do a little outro
or some closing thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I do think there is some skill in
gathering the pollen and pollinating the
[SPEAKER_02]: female plants, I think the real labor and
time is going to be running through the
[SPEAKER_02]: next generation of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to take a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never done this before, but I know
just from running other people's stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine this is going to be a long
while, but I'm rather excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I mentioned what plants I'm
using the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe get into that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The males that I was collecting pollen off
of were Mendocino pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe if not bread popularized by
Ringo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones I got come by way of ITAL
Foundation at a Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they were labeled Island
Paradise, but I think they're F4s of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendo pineapple, which I've never grown
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some friends that have worked on
farms in Mendocino that have told me about
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've definitely ran through a bunch of it
and we always dug it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always really liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know that it had so many minor
cannabinoids in it, which is what truly
[SPEAKER_02]: interested me and motivated me to try to
collect the pollen and throw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like it would be a little bit
easier of a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It being an F4 and pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I asked ITAL about it,
he was kind of saying that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, any male will be the pineapple,
which was very encouraging and maybe will
[SPEAKER_02]: limit the amount of population I have to
run through to look for what I'm looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for if it is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The female that it'll be hit on is an
early flowering Northern Lights number
[SPEAKER_02]: five haze, which is donned the PC3 by
Pifcoast Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that I very,
very, very much so enjoy myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people around me very much so enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that in itself has medicinal
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had it lab tested yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be lab tested within a month
or so, but I feel like both of them
[SPEAKER_02]: together could really be something.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, I want to try to
combine the flavors because I'm very
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor based with my consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I envision it, and again,
I do not know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the concept in my vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what comes of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love if there was a nice
pineapple inhale and then a nice hazy,
[SPEAKER_02]: piffy exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could find something in there with
that, I'd be very, very, very happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the energetic nature and just
generally soaring good vibes of the PC3
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of like the no ceiling high on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that might pair well with the
pineapple as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the pineapple is kind of more like a
feel good mellow buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that they'll marry well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that at least for me and my
crew, most people that like the hazy ones
[SPEAKER_02]: are usually not super discerning on THC
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's one thing that's cool
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it does become something fun and
worthwhile to like run and share,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think people that we're looking
for a type two variety would care too much
[SPEAKER_02]: about high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think too many haze heads are
ever concerned about that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a bonus if it tests like
above 20 or is kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some interesting numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very encouraged to do it and I'll
be making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put the couple PC3s into the flower
room with the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not on the same schedule,
but I'm just going to start there,
[SPEAKER_02]: get their hormones going 12, 12 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it'll be about 10, 11 weeks until
they're harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be popping seeds immediately after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by then it should be close to
springtime as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see what the first generation F1s
are going to do out in the main sunshine
[SPEAKER_02]: and also what they'll do on an inside
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and thank you to everyone who's anyone
who's ever shared knowledge about this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like most things, I kind of take what I
like, like a salad bar of information,
[SPEAKER_02]: try to formulate my own strategy,
but a lot of these concepts being
[SPEAKER_02]: implemented or suggested or talked about
by someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can't think of too much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to document the process some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it'll necessarily be here
on FCP, but certainly I'm going to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: track of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go collect the rest of the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grabbed tomorrow, let it sit for like
12, 20 hours in that little dehumid
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw the pollen that I did collect
directly into the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, after collecting it, I was a little
nervous about the little bits of soil in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine they're holding a fair amount of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my logic was to put it right in the
freezer and kind of just get everything
[SPEAKER_02]: real cold before too much moisture could
move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's any logic in that,
but when I gather the batch tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to be a little bit more
cautious and not leaving any little bits
[SPEAKER_02]: of soil in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was one that smelled very
special as I was shaking them all earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of them, and it wasn't so pineapple-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a deep, deep note.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it wasn't sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a low end kind of funky note.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I thought I was just imagining
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it a little stomach stem rub and it
was very, very strong aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have that one set aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably let that one flower out a
little bit longer and collect that pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe put another female in there a week
or two behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I've sprayed down the room and
jacked the humidity and, uh, I'm very
[SPEAKER_02]: excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Future Cannabis Project for all
the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to everyone else who's kind of
like open source with their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect and, uh, wish me the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know what I want, like most of
us do, but, uh, as far as how to get
[SPEAKER_02]: there, only one way to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate everyone.
Thank you.
