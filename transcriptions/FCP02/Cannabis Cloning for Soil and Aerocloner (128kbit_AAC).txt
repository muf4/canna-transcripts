[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and thank you for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Chad Westport and today I'm
going to show you how to take clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking clones is a relatively simple
process, a process that every grower
[SPEAKER_02]: should know, and the reason I say that is
because if you know how to take a clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're able to keep a single seed
going for many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the case of finding a winner or
something that works great for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a really handy tool to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of tools, I like to get all
of my tools laid out before I actually
[SPEAKER_02]: start cutting on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way I can take my clone, dip it in
what I need to, and stick it straight in
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium of choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I'm going to show you two
different mediums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you how to do it in soil or
cocoa, and then I'm also going to show you
[SPEAKER_02]: the aeroponic cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil and cocoa, pretty simple process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires only a few tools and I do like
to get those laid out beforehand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only going to be taking clones off of
one plant today, but when you're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: clones off of multiple plants,
now is the time to label them accurately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do be sure to use a pen that isn't
going to smear or run off with water
[SPEAKER_02]: because these are going to get wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I have three out today is
we're going to try three different styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try dipping one into clone
X gel, which is a rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to dip another into aloe vera,
which is kind of your organic or natural
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone rooting gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to do one without
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just going to see which ones
root first or root best or have the best
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other tool that you'll notice here is
a fresh clean razor blade.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that you want to do on
each plant that you take clones from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a clean razor blade on every plant
for my IPM because I know that pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: can spread easily through the sap of
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I take a clone from an infected
plant and get the sap on the blade and
[SPEAKER_02]: then go to another plant cut into it,
I've just transferred my pathogen and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's bad news.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good IPM says fresh razor blade for
every plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have pHed water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure my water is pHed and
that's going to give the roots a best
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have pre-watered my soil mix and the
reason I do that is to grow roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want water, but you also
need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that if you dip straight into
the dry soil and then you water it,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a chance for pockets or dry spots
around the stem and we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always water it ahead of time,
get the soil nice and saturated,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not soaked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I stick my clone right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get started and look at the plant
and see where we're going to take our
[SPEAKER_02]: clones from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, you're going to want to take
your clones from the lower portion of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you clean your plant up before you
put it into flower, meaning you take off
[SPEAKER_02]: the lower branches, that's a great time to
select your clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what I'm going to do
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some that are a little bit too
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some that are a little bit too
short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to have a different size
of clone that they're going to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to take them a little bit on the
smaller side.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go from the lower portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, because I'm going into soil
with this, I want to make sure it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit longer so I can get some depth
down into the soil compared to with my
[SPEAKER_02]: arrow cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I don't have a hundred and one
camera angles, I'm going to do this in
[SPEAKER_02]: steps one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's basically one fluid movement from
the time that I cut it to the time that I
[SPEAKER_02]: dip it to the time that I put it into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go ahead and cut this one at the
45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one we dipped in the clone X,
so we're going to label it clone X.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we know which one that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I've selected another good one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from the lower portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has enough space to bury underneath the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go ahead and cut this
one off and dip it in our aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the 45 degree angle that I've
cut on to this stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: See?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open faced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the angle we're looking for here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to scrape this one again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me just show you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to gently scrape the
outside layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that's going to do is that's
going to promote more rooting sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't want to go too deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's just that outer layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're peeling a vegetable or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peeling a carrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let me put my hole into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take my clone with no treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And drop it right on in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a little bit of a hug because we
love our clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clones are good to us, so let's be good to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one we're going to just write
nothing because we've done nothing to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so the last step for these are to get
the humidity dome on and generate a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're about ready to finish
these off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our three clones, the aloe vera,
the clone X, and the nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got that in our tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our tray on our heat mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move that back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got our humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little trick I like to do to kind of
get the humidity going is take your pH
[SPEAKER_02]: water, pHed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray the inside of your dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a little bit of a little bit of
life, a little bit of something to drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little spray on the bottom of the
tray, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spray the leaves because this is how
they're going to get water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real gently.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no roots for them to feed water,
so they got to feed foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them a little spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, it looks good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put on the lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put my tray on like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to close the vent holes on the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to let it sit and clones are
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to finish up here by taking
three more clones off the lower portion of
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are going to the aeroponic
cloner machine, which is my personal
[SPEAKER_02]: preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also tend to take them a little bit
shorter that way the stems don't sit down
[SPEAKER_02]: into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, we've got a short one here
that I'll use this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, geez, it's only about three inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got another one over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about seven inches tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one I'm going to take in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you typically want to take it at like
a nodal space right in the crux.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to be more growth
hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to slice this one in the middle
just to show you that it can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then beyond that, we've got this one
back here, which is it's a normal size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's take our middle cut or middle
cut again, even though it's in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it at a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if I can move this out of the way here
and then get you a good example of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK, we got the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I messed that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I scraped too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we're going to have to go for another
one, but we'll get this middle one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so here's my aerocloner machine with
the three empty holes we're about to fill
[SPEAKER_02]: with the clones that we just took.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's lift the hood real quick,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see under here,
there is a mister, a bunch of misters
[SPEAKER_02]: actually that spray all of the cut of the
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, it forms roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just take our plugs that we just took
and drop them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's our short one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop that in there and our cut from the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need a humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seven days into the cloning project
and I've removed my humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this applies to any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come back and you see that your
leaves are dry, give them a little spray,
[SPEAKER_02]: because until they have roots,
this is how they're going to get water and
[SPEAKER_02]: feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of them have pressure in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can tell that something is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't see the roots, so you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the aloe vera, the clone X and the one
that we did nothing to, they all look the
[SPEAKER_02]: same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clones in the soil were looking good,
but we don't really know if they have
[SPEAKER_02]: roots yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the aero cloner, we'll be able to
tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a look at our cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the cut that we took from the
middle of the branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put nothing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any roots yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have the medium sized cut that we
dipped in the aloe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple little roots on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have more days in the aero
cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have our shortest cut with the
clone X that definitely has roots on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the aero cloner race goes,
clone X wins.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for tuning in to my rough guide
on taking clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Chad Westport, and please join me
again next time.
Thank you.
