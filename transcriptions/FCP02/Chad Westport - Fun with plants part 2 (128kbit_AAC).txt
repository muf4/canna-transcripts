[SPEAKER_00]: Okay guys, we are three days after you
last saw it in the previous video I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to notice that the leaves they're
changing a little bit of color and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to droop a little bit Usually to
me that means the clone is ready for soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's check out the roots on this bad
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah I would say that's ready for the
soil
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go guys that is the roots That is
the roots we got off of this massive
[SPEAKER_00]: Frickin cloning attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're just gonna put it in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna see if it lives Check out
those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, we are 24 hours after taking
it from the aero cloner and putting It
[SPEAKER_00]: into the pot and these things look pretty
limp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much water pressure This is
actually what I was expecting when I took
[SPEAKER_00]: it as a clone, but hey it did good in the
aero cloner Right now I've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: misting it with some water kind of foliar
feed it a little bit if I can And we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna leave it in here and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's gonna bounce back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your comments in the comment section
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy cow y'all it's five days since I took
this thing out of the Cloner it was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking a little limp these things were
down and droopy but look at that They're
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're turgid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's water pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing so I don't think I'm the
first but When's the last time you saw
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody take a two-foot clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom breaking science Or whatever Now the
only thing really left to do is take this
[SPEAKER_00]: And take the bottom half and flower them
and we'll see how we get it We're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our bottom and we're about ready
to put these into flower And for anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that was curious the amount of time this
took is not very much Less than 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took 27 days actually on the 26th I
made the cut on the 8th I had my first
[SPEAKER_00]: roots which you saw in part one That was a
12-day difference six days after that on
[SPEAKER_00]: the 14th I transplanted it into the soil
with that big root mass Which you see in
[SPEAKER_00]: this video and nine days after that on the
23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting them into flower So in a
month's time I really created two plants
[SPEAKER_00]: out of one because of this Twin Peaks to
plant topping system This bottom part,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it really filled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really filled in it became a nice bush
with a lot of top colas These middles have
[SPEAKER_00]: filled in so it's gonna be a lot of bud
produced on this plant And it's a long way
[SPEAKER_00]: from that scraggly looking plant in the
beginning less than 30 days ago
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got our top, you know, it's it's
got nice water pressure in it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking good It's getting new growth
and really I'd probably let it go another
[SPEAKER_00]: week But I'm putting it into flower now
because hey rotation is rotation guys We
[SPEAKER_00]: are ten days into flower now and In case I
haven't said it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna declare this one a successful
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean look at them We've got them
starting to form buds both the top both
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting nice bud formation So yes,
this successfully has been a clone and I
[SPEAKER_00]: am definitely gonna say that's the largest
clone I've ever taken I mean who knew but
[SPEAKER_00]: like somebody I think mentioned in
comments This is good to know in case you
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to snap a plant in half All is not
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know now that hey, you might just be
able to clone that thing I mean we took
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing we chopped this plant in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stuck this part in the aero cloner We
got some decent roots on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let it veg for a week It's been a
flower for ten days and ladies and
[SPEAKER_00]: gentlemen, it is getting buds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, that is a successful clone and You
know another thing I want to say too is
[SPEAKER_00]: also All these buds here all these top
shoots that you see if these were all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way under here There is no way they would
get the same amount of light and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no way it would produce the same amount of
yield that it's going to produce like it
[SPEAKER_00]: is here so By chopping this plant in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I actually just increase my yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to know I'm curious
to find out and let me know in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments what you think is gonna produce
The heftier buds is it gonna be the top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it gonna be the bottom with
presumably the thicker fuller root system?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out but I'll keep you guys
updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no worries there Another possible
advantage to this is this really helped
[SPEAKER_00]: keep my plant count down You know,
I only was growing one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saved time I saved materials I had
one plant until I saw the pre flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: I Realized it was a female and then I
turned it into two That could be helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: for somebody that is trying to keep their
plant count down Because you only have to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow certain amount of plants and then if
you like them They're females you turn
[SPEAKER_00]: them into two give it 30 days as I did and
voila you have two nicely growing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower out so Some potential advantages
to doing this twin peaks to plant topping
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but it's not you know I'm not
gonna say this is a commercially viable
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you could do at
home You can have fun with it Who knows
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be able to increase your yields
keep your plant count lower But it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something to have fun with and you got to
have some fun while you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why we do this You You You
You
