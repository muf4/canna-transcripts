[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Future Cannabis Project I'm a guerrilla
grower from Balkans Europe I grow
[SPEAKER_00]: different things vegetables, trees and so
on but this video is about my hidden
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis garden I grow on a nearby hill
about an hour from my home mostly in
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil which is kind of a red clayish
soil the only amendments I use are the cow
[SPEAKER_00]: manure from the local cows the water I use
is mostly public water a small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: water is rainwater I collect on the hill
I've been growing mostly bag seed last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years which is Albanian weed you buy on
the streets this year I'm trying out
[SPEAKER_00]: something different but first some videos
of my last year I had three plants two
[SPEAKER_00]: made it Doji Draghi Mok
[SPEAKER_00]: Around about summer solstice is also a
time when wild fruits start to ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these blueberries and wild figs
which are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are abundant on the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something to munch on while
carrying water on my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I harvested the plant around
15th of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a bit too early, a week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had a terrible rain for a few
days and heavy winds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly it's in hot and arid
environment till October.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I decided this year to try auto
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought the cheapest auto seeds I can
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 5 euro for a bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far they are doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said in native soil and mostly rain
these last days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew up very nice and they are loving
the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think is the greatest factor in
growing these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
