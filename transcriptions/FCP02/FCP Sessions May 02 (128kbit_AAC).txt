[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone in the future is missing a
really great set today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this old joint of OG build around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four Dave Goldenco stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four brought the SD deck towards bangers,
which are, I think, some of our favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: bangers in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Bob Snoggrass pipe that the
homie brought through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, things are very good to break
into.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bro, the sovereignty, too?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't bring the saw?
[SPEAKER_08]: The saw was crazy last time.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that, dude?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an inverted four?
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are the soft squad,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soft squad.
Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: From my collection of all the saws I had,
I still have my 44 mil G-line grid cap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring it next week.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best one to keep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll bring it next week.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's lit.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the context of the viewers,
we're talking about some sovereignty
[SPEAKER_07]: glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sovereignty, you've collected
sovereignty for a minute, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long have you been collecting?
[SPEAKER_08]: Some fake labels?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, probably like 2010, 2011.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not recording?
[SPEAKER_11]: Take it from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so we just talked about a lot of
sovereignty glass, and none of you will
[SPEAKER_02]: ever get to know what it is that we just
talked about.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about Four's SD Dank
collab.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody hit up Four on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Four, what's your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get a microphone for Four to say it
into.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at the guy with the microphone right
next to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: At FourRosin, F-O-U-R-R-O-S-I-N,
2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also at Four Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, give me a follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give all the boys a follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Four.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then you also went to see Bob
Snodgrass, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This weekend I was at the Peace of Mind
glass shop in Newport Bay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on the beach, and I was able to
scoop this 2023 Bob Snodgrass original
[SPEAKER_06]: Solos skull pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, yeah, Peace of Mind, yeah,
yeah, Peace of Mind, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell them what else was there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was Bob.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Bob Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Jenny Snodgrass, his daughter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Johnny G., Jenny's husband.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Ryder, their little son.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't D-Wreck there, a few other foods.
[SPEAKER_06]: D-Wreck might have been there later on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhino was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhino.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rhino was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hoops was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a bunch of people there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Megan Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was killer, yeah, it was killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it was, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was this weekend?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this was on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Started at 3 o'clock for VIPs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Public was at 5 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's 78 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: 77 or 78 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you talked to him for a little bit,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we got to congregate about his pipes
and about how his style has changed over
[SPEAKER_06]: the years from how now that everyone's
dabbing and the difference in techniques
[SPEAKER_06]: that he's been using and the skull
techniques he's been doing and the collabs
[SPEAKER_06]: with all the people he's been doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He recently just released this new Rhino
collab that they just released.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a Rhino duck skull sidecar hammer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just the only one of its kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last time that Rhino and Bob
Snodgrass said to each other that they
[SPEAKER_06]: think they didn't even have a collab
together, so those two pieces alone were
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the most insane pieces of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the homie Freshpress was
explaining earlier that Snodgrass really
[SPEAKER_02]: invented a lot of tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know any of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: People consider him the godfather of the
glass pipe, and sometimes people will get,
[SPEAKER_09]: ooh, a seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: People will start to get nitpicky about
it, but most OGs would say Bob Snodgrass
[SPEAKER_09]: invented the weed pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that you're rolling up that we
just found out?
[SPEAKER_09]: This.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is some Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, what's up with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, I got a Colombian seed for you.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian Haze B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to smell it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we didn't get to last week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: True that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're about to roll this shit up and
get fucking faded.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to have an Otis master
class right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how to pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to roll a fat bar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: How to bar it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's Jazz when we need him?
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to focus it.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So guys, I'm going to make it quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry, bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is how I roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: First, I pick all the stems out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty important to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, it's going to taste like
firewood.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next, after grinding it pretty finely,
I like to take two to three of these tips.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any kind of tip is OK, but give it a
couple of folds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Lakers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Lakers.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your folds rocking again.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to prove Ross wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, how are you feeling about the
Celtics while we roll this joint?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not feeling good tonight.
[SPEAKER_10]: No?
[SPEAKER_10]: They lost last night.
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Bruins got knocked out in game seven.
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is going to be our tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so they won without a beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for them, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I folded two together, and then I put one
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Folded two together, put one around it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're talking about the
Colombian is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm showing the people why I got to type
on the SATs.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's real, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh,
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?
Legend.
[SPEAKER_09]: Legend in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like a dab, Jeremy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I brought some oil today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's BHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody would have any.
Hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I brought some BHO for everyone to
try.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've got some good oil from this
company before, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure we'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody else would have BHO,
I figured.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's one person I would trust
BHO from, it's you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: True that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had like a competition level
thing to be like, now, here's something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure it'll be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You certainly have the ethos to pull up
with some BHO.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show up and take whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no shame.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no shame.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there doesn't need to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking to the person who runs the
secret cup here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, I have a question that I meant
to ask you, and I never did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire away.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the solvent competition days,
did you feel like there was more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of terps on the table than sort of
what is available now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes yes and sometimes no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have a tangy wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it was like, I remember one
competition was like 10 tangy entries or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like that profile of terp,
so I can't hate on it too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss those flavors now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes it would be very,
like especially the early days before
[SPEAKER_03]: people knew what people were going to
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would just come with all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had like a purple variety win one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times they were fruity varieties
that were winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and so were you seeing like equatorial
type stuff that doesn't typically wash or
[SPEAKER_02]: produce good hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it mostly still fruity modern
stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people would take it upon
themselves to do something difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were like, okay, not only am I
going to enter, I'm going to do something
[SPEAKER_03]: like where there's a story to my entry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, it was kind of cool in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one of the girls had entered a
purple variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she was like the only female in the
competition, first of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she had decided to go with
something total.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody else entered a purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody has won with something like
that or competed really with something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like a shot out there and people
liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it won.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was really happy to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it when something like that
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other one would be
solventless entries.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would be like, this is a VHO
competition, but I'm showing up with my
[SPEAKER_03]: solventless entry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't care if it wins or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those did start winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt really bad for the people in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They entered the Barb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever heard of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that different than the Barbara Bud or
is that the same thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they scored very low in the
competition because it was a solventless
[SPEAKER_03]: entry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the other entries were VHO for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it showed the lack of knowledge from
those VHO people in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they're in Spain where it's
solventless and there's a lot of great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might even be more popular than VHO
out there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just didn't have the knowledge to
be like, oh, no, this is high quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: This deserves to get a higher score.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sucks, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I also hated was people would
try to send a message with their votes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they didn't like something about it,
they'd just write everything once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wouldn't be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the things, I remember somebody
pointing out, they're like, how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a better color than this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the things are close to as good as
they could possibly get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it would be very unfair to vote
somebody like a one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, what are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the Secret Cup, were they
labeled entries, I guess?
[SPEAKER_03]: So no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way we would do our intake is I'd
have a group like you guys helping me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody would show up with their
bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would have their entries
pre-grammed out into their little,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was 0.3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a few grams for the
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also had a dab ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a bar at the event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was what those extra grams
were for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they would show up with these bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would give them a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would hang out over there while we
were doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would organize all the kits right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd all go in the same jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd show where we bought the jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could literally show up with your
stuff already jarred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would just have to sticker it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so sometimes you could tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the entries, there's no disguising
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knew that this one was a certain
person's because it was so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it stood out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also used to do a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's video of this on Weed Maps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Colombian Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would bring out the whole kit to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd be like, pick your, tell us which
one is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And almost always, I'd say 80% wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would be like, oh, that's mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're smoking some Colombian Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make its way to you shortly from our
friend Dave at Golden Coast Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked that you guys are kind of
aficionados on cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have a really great knowledge
about stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: More so than myself, I would say now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would want to ask you guys questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all have lots to learn from each other,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we appreciate the, I think we
appreciate your veteran industry status
[SPEAKER_09]: and the stories you bring to the table and
the wisdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you, as someone who has learned
about this stuff more recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: our conversation sort of expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: My perspective on a lot of, I mean,
BHO, namely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wasn't around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only existed in this sort of solventless
superiority landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I sort of know where I fall,
but it's interesting to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also to see people coming around
and basically being like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's stuff that doesn't wash and you
still want to smoke as hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be super clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the big things I learned
in the Seeker Cup is that I would say most
[SPEAKER_03]: things are better as a BHO, but certain
things are not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's when the washing is really
valuable on, well, I mean, Brandon used to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it really often with the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Skittles BHO that I would get,
I never thought was the greatest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good, but I always thought Tangy
was better.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, he would enter solventless
entries that were really, really,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they had a great flavor profile,
but they were also very stony.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's hard to do with BHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like solventless is almost always
more stony, more like strong, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But so much of it had, I used to grow a
strain called Casey Jones and it had a
[SPEAKER_03]: very like distinct smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I would go to sell it,
people would always be like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_03]: is this like, they didn't know what it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was odd, but like appealing to
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that smell and flavor off of almost
every solventless extract that I've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain ones that don't have it at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can be done, but almost all of
them have this like flavor that I really
[SPEAKER_03]: liked where I'm like, I wonder what that
is, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's gotta be something, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel that, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Zach, do you want to come on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you were talking about the,
what, oh, this is the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see the mic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to hit some full melt water
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brand is Turtle Trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain is OG Pybreath.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bag size is 149.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from my friend right here,
Packs To The Future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything to say before I try
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is an interesting one only
because we also have the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one that I think really is
shines and melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the hash is where it
belongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like into the conversation we
were having earlier, like I wonder what
[SPEAKER_02]: the third reality would be if it was
blasted and what that would be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is one where the flower is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the hash is sensational.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever smoke hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not dab it, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain, elaborate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a hash hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's various ways that you can smoke
hash, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people put it in like a joint or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Amsterdam, they call tobacco and hash
joints stickies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're traditional.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG, who just left, is a big fan of the
stickies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their traditional joint is a spliff,
which everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how I kind of first got
introduced to various ways of mixing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can obviously mix it into a bowl,
mix it into a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I used to prefer smoking it over a bed
of ashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would maybe smoke a bowl in a pipe,
leave the ashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you could put little chunks of
hash on top of the ashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would just kind of, you could let
them catch on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would kind of, they'd smoke on the
outside like a coal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd kind of catch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like ember in towards the center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could get it all in like one hit
if you really got it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this bubble hash or was this
traditional hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually the better was bubble hash,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it could be keif.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had some really, really fire,
fire, sifts and hashes like that that had,
[SPEAKER_03]: so what I thought was interesting is they
don't represent the strain anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would never know it was the same
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this hash was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a blind test, I would think it
was rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, it was super smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that oil just melted just the way
I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Turtle Trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Turtle Trees in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, I guess what were,
we talked about the standout states and
[SPEAKER_02]: you said it was some of the East Coast
guys, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, it does feel like right
now a lot of the most exciting stuff is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from outside of California is I
guess where I'm coming from with things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these guys are from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan, I like to bring up Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Auto Flower Cup winner was from
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes, that was my event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, good to see you again as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Michigan I think is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I kind of feel like everywhere has it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just more abundant in certain places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Oklahoma up and going by the time you
were?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we didn't do Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I understand, a lot of
what's quality in Oklahoma would be kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of imports.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're people that came to Oklahoma from
somewhere else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think shout out to a lot of really
talented people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who made that move.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's cool that I think
sometimes Oklahoma for that reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: weed gets passed off as California weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's certain people who have
their facilities out there and they still
[SPEAKER_02]: have their market here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all kind of comes together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overseas they think they get California
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the packaging being sold can be shipped
overseas very easily and legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can put whatever in that
packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're smoking on some Suave from the boys
Sour Waves.
[SPEAKER_12]: You already know King Sour Waves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Sour Waves for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a RS 37 Fino as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Got some jars.
[SPEAKER_12]: You already know he coming with that shirt
bang.
[SPEAKER_12]: A bunch of other shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we were doing dispensaries back in
the day, there were always certain strains
[SPEAKER_03]: that were like every dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that's, so the strains
that would be like, there'd be a variety
[SPEAKER_03]: of OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they'd be like the planetary
OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be like the abrasive cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like all these different ones,
jet fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jet fuel might be a different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were jet fuel OG back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that actually has anything
genetically to do with what jet fuel is
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back then that was one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was dead head OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like a gazillion different Larry
OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you would have a variety of OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There would be like a Jack Herreraire or
maybe like a train wreck sometimes or some
[SPEAKER_03]: other kind of lemony.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was your turpinilion category.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Herreraire almost always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there would be like green crack or
blue dream or both.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times I like the green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my favorite like turpin
profiles out of any strain ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the hash I think is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there would be like granddaddy or
purple oracle or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There would be, they tried to have a
little like a variety of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think they do that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: 215 makes everything harder.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why it's great to come to a
session to get to see so many cool
[SPEAKER_02]: different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did we think of that Colombian
that we just smoked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minty.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Minty.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I said I thought it tasted really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't honestly love the smell out of
the jar, but it smoked really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Reminds me of some old weed we used to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stuff from Sour Waves is really
nice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a classic gelato-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this one too though.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the flavor really shines after six
or seven hits.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if it is RS, phenol, you know,
I think it has a lot more guava to me than
[SPEAKER_12]: the OZ, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: OZX or OZK, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly wasn't loving it at first,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's a smooth representation
of, like it's more sherby than the RS.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I love everything he does.
[SPEAKER_12]: It grows pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good weed and he's a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super dang.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for having me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you about to go?
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that far.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're here from Oceanside, California.
[SPEAKER_12]: You already know San Diego on the map.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do the genetics come from?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like, where does the RS come from?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure it's from Dio.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure it's from Dio Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, from Oakland.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this, he's a very modern people
really like his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the RS 11 that was pretty prominent
and then the Zope recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some serious cannabis genetics
out in the Bay area for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say as someone who's not from
there, the most serious, like that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything that I admire is from
up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It might very well be the most modern
game, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It was built on gelato, in my opinion,
or certain things of gelato crosses.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's where it's from.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even the old, like the old NorCal
perps, like.
[SPEAKER_12]: Perp?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I wasn't there for that time,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember, but she.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was your favorite of the NorCal
perps?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always liked Purple Oracle and like,
obviously the pop, the popular one was
[SPEAKER_03]: Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one that everybody knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I would sometimes get a variety
of Granddaddy that was really nice,
[SPEAKER_03]: but usually it was other purple varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Princess I had once and that,
like, I remember getting the bags from
[SPEAKER_03]: that and it looked like Toys R Us weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was, it looked fake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you got some weed that was just so
colored, it was like not real.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the perps, I've had that a few
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't like that purpley in flavor,
but it was purpley, like super potent,
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very strong, like a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting that you distinguish
purple as like a flavor from appearance,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I feel like a lot of the best
Oracle I've smoked is pretty green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on farms where the plants are
like half purple, half green, one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just comes sometimes that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times the purple is like
something the plant does genetically,
[SPEAKER_03]: but other times it's just something it
does kind of from climate and other other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple is one of my favorite varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss the purple being like as prevalent
as it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I also feel like it's one of the
nicer effect profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially as flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flower smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just is very peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe more than sort of the, I mean,
the other stuff, you know, the more modern
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, like even this is nice,
but it has an uplifting polyhybrid that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there is something in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives you that and all of the
gelatos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's why people love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such an everyday consistent,
but it's also cool to go back and try
[SPEAKER_02]: things that don't have all of that
polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of the things will come back
because people just aren't used to the you
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of you get caught up in whatever's
going and you can easily kind of forget
[SPEAKER_03]: about the things you used to like or maybe
you didn't get exposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I I'm still learning about
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these hazes that we just smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to me, I would say that that smells
almost kind of wet, but it didn't smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: white at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hayes has been around since the sixties,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Late sixties.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the originals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a wartime era type of strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend, Todd McCormick, who runs
authentic genetics is like the machine
[SPEAKER_03]: auto on Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would refer to him on anything that I
would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it is like one of those early
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the Sam the Skunk Man,
one of those ones that he brought over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of the very, very first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also feel like Hayes, it's one of
those things where there is a cross,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it also sort of is people refer
to a certain genotype generally as like
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayes, whereas like this is probably you
know, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've heard and it's an interesting
thing because there is a proper cross that
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Hayes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am referring to something that would be
genetically a Hayes variety.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is different than things that
people sometimes refer to as Hayes' kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a category.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I feel like it sort of is these more
equatorial, lighter, not very fruity,
[SPEAKER_02]: more insensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say I've had a Colombian
Hayes in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fruity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like super potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the best Hayes' I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't remember the seed company,
but I think it might have been Barney's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Colombian Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I stole your seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: This couch is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking Hayes, which is one that you
can chop it up about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, in fact, have the real piff on the
table.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't bring the other ones,
but I've got from my friend, my same
[SPEAKER_09]: friend's library.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the velvet buzzsaw, which is like a
Thai Hayes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: What else?
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the Bubba Tom Hill Hayes.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got the fucking.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the other one?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just caught myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I encounter good weed, I'll like
sniff it like four or five times in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, that was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sit there for a minute, and then I'll
catch myself after like the third or
[SPEAKER_03]: fourth time being like, you already know
what this smells like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the triple take.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a very good impulse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the kind of weed I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll also say, so like, I've had some
weed like this that was like sensi star or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the, I think Todd is doing
something or like someone he knows is
[SPEAKER_03]: doing something where they're trying to
kind of establish characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants where you can really identify what
is an authentic new genetic cross and what
[SPEAKER_03]: is somebody naming a phenotype after
themselves or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of the new strains over
the years have not been authentically
[SPEAKER_03]: different than some of their original
parents to the earlier conversation we
[SPEAKER_02]: were having.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, so since cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, really, if you're talking
about it since OG, so much of it has been
[SPEAKER_02]: bag seed cross something where it's
getting bottlenecked so much of these
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses that are probably the progeny of
different parents are the same bottleneck
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, OK, well, this cross of the
cookie stuff tastes a heck of a lot like
[SPEAKER_02]: this cross of the cookie stuff.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I haven't seen all of them
in the garden, but at least in the mouth,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are different crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as you talk to breeders,
you can be like, OK, how many phenos do
[SPEAKER_03]: you see of your plant?
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, what are we rolling next?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to roll some pips.
Pips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know breeders that have like four
phenos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most, though, are like 12 different
phenos.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like 16 phenos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like you can get anything in
this situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as you're growing these plants,
there's obviously the growers influence on
[SPEAKER_03]: how the plant is going to produce and like
represent these different aspects of its
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how authentically different are
some of these plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd would say that almost none of them
are different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very likely we're dealing with like
maybe 10 varieties or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if it's quite that low.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may be misrepresenting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's far fewer than the
thousands of varieties that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, available by seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love the science of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we gave leaves at the auto flower
cup to a company that's doing like DNA
[SPEAKER_03]: testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're trying to establish genetic
markers in the plants so that they can
[SPEAKER_03]: say, this is a sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So auto flowering is basically fast
flowering.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a plant you ask.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has become my specialty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like a small proponent of this over
the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was never a believer until recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, breeding auto flower has come to a
point where most plants, I would say,
[SPEAKER_03]: are competitive or better than their photo
period brothers and sisters, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So an auto flower plant, you plant the
seed and you have 100 grams in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way they like me to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the simple way of describing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, these plants come from a
place where the sun wasn't setting on
[SPEAKER_03]: normal hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is a weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very resilient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It developed a way of living in these
climates where you'll have long periods of
[SPEAKER_03]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So auto flower plants don't mature based
on the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could give them very little light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could give them a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to grow at the same pace
and be finished roughly at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: no matter what you do to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before those Siberian winters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So places like Russia, places where you
don't have a full outdoor season,
[SPEAKER_03]: they do auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And up until recently, the THC percentages
and the terping profiles have not really
[SPEAKER_03]: been that impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But within the last five years,
they've started to get really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then within the last, I'd say,
two, maybe one year, they've really become
[SPEAKER_03]: what they are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in our competition, I saw some of
the plants we tested them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had one of them that was 29% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bag appeal is exactly like photo
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells like the terping profile is exactly
the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point, if you can get a super
silver haze or something like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can grow it in that short period
of time, why would you not do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the varieties that are popular,
you can get them as auto flower seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can grow those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're an outdoor grower,
let's say, and you have a big outdoor area
[SPEAKER_03]: where you move your plants at a point in
the year, you could pop autos in that
[SPEAKER_03]: garden up until the time where you're
going to move your photo periods out there
[SPEAKER_03]: and triple your harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they really show a great opportunity
for growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also good for amateur growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where maybe your lights go off or you have
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're not going to just die.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to mostly live.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, they might hermaphrodite if
you're exposing them to a lot of negative
[SPEAKER_03]: climate and these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll do the same kind of thing that
photo periods would do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm seeing autos kind of take over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I've talked to other breeders,
they're like 80% of the business is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to become autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really good to start now,
start learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not immediately like probably you're
going to do great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been encouraging people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The auto flower cup is probably going to
be in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've actually spoken to the people from
Spain now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like we might be doing the
Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't do the Bay Area, we're going
to do the beach out here in LA again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's January.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could start autos now and compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely an emerging category.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really happy to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like kind of representing the underdog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really hopeful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you have a track record of being
Prussian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a snotty?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a snotty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snotty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wait, I'm going to sneak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made him rig rags.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to have a company where we would
screen print handkerchiefs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I made handkerchiefs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He came down this Saturday for the Peace
of Mind Snodgrass family temple takeover.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so him and Jenny, his daughter,
and then Johnny, her husband, and then
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryder, their son, was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they all came through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Bob was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob was just like, yeah, signing
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, this is a Bob Solo.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Bob Solo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought all four Bob Solos that were
available.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also bought a Bob, Jenny,
and Johnny collab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sherlock, my dad, actually got that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a classic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I bought a Bob Marble collab with
the manager of Peace of Mind, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: Megan, Megan Glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: That goes into my collection.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two other Bob Marbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two other Bob Marbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do a trade show, and Snodgrass
would be at the whole family.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at pictures on Instagram,
on Facebook of those times, just scrolling
[SPEAKER_06]: back to see how different it was being
able to go to the trade show and just have
[SPEAKER_06]: crates of Snodgrass glass, where people
were like, oh, yeah, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's even hard to get your hands
on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it was just, he was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut out future cannabis project,
baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just insane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's awesome that people got to
experience that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's real, real glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes he would party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember my friend being on acid,
hanging out with Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because he doesn't dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole family doesn't dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: They only smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were just smoking flour the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was going hard as an older guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's super sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell he's had some good fun in his
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about many good stories with
Grateful Dead and Jerry and just times he
[SPEAKER_06]: had at the concerts.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's lived a great life, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been around some really, really good
people, too, his whole entire life.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's only been an upwards spiral.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't happen to everybody that does
the OG shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm really happy he gets the
respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and he has at least five or more
apprentices.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he has so many people that follow him
and want him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And his culture is so big and large.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else do you guys like as glass
these days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the hot glass artist?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, right now, one of the hottest
is, I'd say, Contrabasso.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Elijah Copeland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Elijah Copeland is probably one of the
most wanted artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was familiar with Contrabasso.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of his recyclers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that still what is popular?
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so now his main focus,
I think, is on the recycler called the
[SPEAKER_06]: hypercycler.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'm not familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think now his retail is starting at
$60,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the prices of glass blow me away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's if you are able to even get
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He only makes five pipes a year because he
can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And his demand is so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were the prices of glass when you
were around, like your young days?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'll go the full circle,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I first liked glass, I was just a
kid going into a head shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, damn, that one's dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say late 90s, late 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like 97.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably in that realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I'm going to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they didn't sign the pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't like, oh, this is this guy's
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, oh, these are the heady ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these are the lower priced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expensive was like $500 to maybe a couple
thousand tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more than three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say $500 to $1,000, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, 97?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we talking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What years are we talking?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to buy a pipe every year I would
go to the Cannabis Cup because when you
[SPEAKER_03]: would take a pipe like that to Amsterdam,
they had no artists, zero artists like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would see these pipes and they'd
be like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in the 90s, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late 90s and early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say with inflation, you're still
looking at like $2,000, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Around the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought it for $500 back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know who the artist was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after I started meeting all of the
glassblowers, I asked my friend,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, hey, do you think we could
figure it out?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll post it on my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like hundreds of glassblowers will see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Posted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People started saying, I think it's a
Darby.
[SPEAKER_03]: They started tagging Darby in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, Darby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Darby is like, no, but I think it's my
brother, Karsten's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he tags Karsten's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Karsten's like, yep, he made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a Karsten Carlisle from like 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the difference in glass from
now, though?
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked him what he thought it was worth.
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought it was worth like $3,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, man, that should be like $5,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but you do see the difference,
right, in glass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought it to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not just a collectible to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a pipe that I have memories
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, your common Rhino,
your common Muller, your common Darby,
[SPEAKER_01]: that style was not around in the 90s,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that's where I put the value into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, I didn't see too much symmetry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more like hand blown, hand blown,
no molds, nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as the different techniques were
developed, I remember when Inside Out
[SPEAKER_03]: Glass came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside Out Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because before that, it was just like wrap
and roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they started figuring out like,
oh, you can do frit on a pipe and turn it
[SPEAKER_03]: inside out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it looks like totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so different techniques would happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you would see it reflected in the
head shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had advanced with time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right now, the rigs that I'm looking
at, they're made in segments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one entire rig could have a head shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have art within the art within
the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have millies within a marble
that's encased, that's on the shoulder of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a duck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the dude had to make the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where the price goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my current favorite artist that I saw
at the last time I was at Glass Vegas was
[SPEAKER_03]: Laceface.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laceface?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How long has he been around?
[SPEAKER_05]: She has been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to her from the Glass game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: $50,000 to $60,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I was like, Lace, I saw her.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I think you're doing better
work than what Banjo is putting out right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Banjo's pieces are insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he is capable of more than what these
like single color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one there for $60,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've hit that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, it used to be you would go to
AGE.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd go to AGE.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd go to like Hitman's room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Doug would have like a secret
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I hit was it was like the one
where it was like the angel like spreading
[SPEAKER_03]: its wings and like kissing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you hit it off of the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a standing one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like this tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend Doug had a special piece that
looked like just regular Chinese writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would pull it off the wall and it
was a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell that it was a piece until
he plucked it off the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug had a lot of cool pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, man, he had a lot of cool pieces
at that shop, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the Star Wars ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Star Wars one ended with my
friend Peerstar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like a cartridge company,
a pen distillate company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember when Darth Vader ended up
with Peerstar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Vader helmet came out at Champs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it was 30 grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it ended up selling for $45,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: $50,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the highest priced piece ever
at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the prices went up quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first started getting into rigs,
they were like tops maybe like five grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like maybe like a Toro or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first expensive rig I saw was the
Dinosaur head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was around $300,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giant T-Rex head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, who will praise this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess that's what people will praise
glass for, $300,000 for a T-Rex head.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's whatever people are willing to pay
for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You walk into Illusion's Glass Gallery in
Denver, Colorado, and they have a pipe
[SPEAKER_06]: priced at a million.
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, it's a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Dan Bilzerian.
[SPEAKER_06]: The nicest pipe that I've seen recently
that hasn't recently been sold is Buck
[SPEAKER_06]: Glass made like an eight foot actual
alligator or crocodile out of full glass
[SPEAKER_06]: that was suspended on the ceiling in an
Australian gallery.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it just sold recently to a
collector in Florida for $250,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like hand delivered.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a cool Buck and Darby story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first time we ever met them,
there was a trade show in Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_03]: called the International Glass Expo or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was at the Los Angeles,
the place across the street from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Staples Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a booth there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was writing for a magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I got a free booth at that
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I sold it or I shared it with
somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had a booth there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like a wholesale and a retail
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a retail side and then there
was a wholesale side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the deadest glass show I have ever
been to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody came.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people went to the wholesale side.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had like some.
[SPEAKER_03]: The retail side was like pathetically bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And me and my friend, we had set up a
whole booth and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lace Face was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certain people were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were all stoked to get to see all
these cool pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend bought a really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, it was new.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, oh, I'm forgetting the technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where you have the copper that goes
on the outside of the glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Electroforming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So electroforming had just come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he had bought this like blue,
like coral looking electroformed piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were hitting off of it and da da da
da da.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my friend is the slowest at all the
trade shows to clean up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were the last people in the
trade show arena cleaning up at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who else was the last people in the
trade show Darby and Buck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it was only us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were walking stuff out to the
car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, hey, do you guys want,
we had dabs and they had glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, hey, you guys want to
smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were like, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they weren't like, they didn't have
the names they have now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like popular then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were really nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we smoked with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hitting Darby's rig and looking
at my friend and being like, what the
fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know a gentleman by the name of
Banana Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I know him or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to bring this man on the
podcast because this guy has all the
[SPEAKER_01]: Darby, D-Wreck, Hooves, Rhino.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has stories with all these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the Joe P stuff, all these cool
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes to dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does everything with these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like his family, his brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel two ways about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the people that are nice, like Darby
and all them, I love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad that they have the easy jobs
that they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easy for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it's hard for Darby.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like he makes five pieces a year
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these people are family men too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a family guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just like a cake walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's good that he's getting the
respect he has.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain people out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I remember when Sokol was really
popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never heard of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's not so popular anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: When did he have his start?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the thing about it was, for whatever
reason, I think his personality ruined his
[SPEAKER_03]: art.
[SPEAKER_03]: The person behind the thing, he just had
too many bad things happen publicly with
[SPEAKER_03]: people to where his art was not able to
continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that he had made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a whole bunch of really,
really cringey moments that negatively
[SPEAKER_03]: affected his art.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things where all the collectors are
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this community.
[SPEAKER_06]: The gospel community is a small community.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not throwing him under the bus
saying the stories, but I do feel like it
[SPEAKER_03]: was authentically the person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he did deserve to lose the value of
his pieces if he's going to be acting this
[SPEAKER_03]: way and doing these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other people that I don't think
deserve the value they have of their
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be cool about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be a nice person.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a blessing when you have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the same way about myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should hear, have you heard the way
they talk about heady boys and things like
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of stuff that's recently
been going on with the glass community
[SPEAKER_06]: that's been crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very interesting to me to where
you basically hate the people that support
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you own any glass of your own?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I own some glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything super fancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Merck piece that's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have a problem where I wanted to
buy a piece at every show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I went with what I could afford and
what visually was appealing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of my glass is worthless.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a shitload of Hitman pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Doug, Hitman.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's the value of that
or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot went on with Hitman to where some of
it might not be as valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it might be more valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a couple of Dabuccinos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what people would pay for
that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have those same slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good old Hitman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck to Doug at the Best of New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's going to be a great
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone should go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the last time you owned or have you
ever owned a China rig?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so I don't hate on it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: A China rig?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my China rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I have a China rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I definitely have China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me the pros and cons of China
glass, please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your opinion, your experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'll say is some of the Chinese
artists are stepping it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the art is authentically dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody made that over there,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, MJ Arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a California designed and
manufactured in China brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I asked an American artist to recreate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me he would charge me about
$600 to $800 to recreate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, man, I got this piece
for 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a value to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when you're smoking,
there's like functionality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is vanity, OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyword vanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is entirely what all the glass
stuff is about.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to be like, no,
I like the way that it looks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll say this whole thing about how
it makes them feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a function guy, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're buying a $60,000 rig or
whatever, you're buying that for vanity
[SPEAKER_03]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like who has the biggest boat and the
biggest truck, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's buying a fancy fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's buying fancy clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to show off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in our jeans, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want the biggest boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is definitely a value to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I've owned things and you walk into a
place and everybody's like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels way better than when you have
some shitty thing and everybody's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, do you want to borrow a nail or
whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm guilty of having one China
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about nine other rigs, but one
China rig for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did say I have a bunch of Hitman
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Hitman, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All his new stuff is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys should check out all his new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compound, was it the compound or the
double helix lucky one?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few really, really cool
compound rigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the compound series,
if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a series of rigs that look like
they're just molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll also say, Doug gets knocked off by
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the compound cube in downtown LA
right there on 4th Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy how quickly it happens,
where he'll come out with something and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're on it so fast to just copy him and
do it for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be more forgiveness.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for that, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you want to try and dab my BHO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe I can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, do you mind if I heat you
up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you, brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to slide in and roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, which one should we do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I noticed that everybody is,
there's nobody smoking like a bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes there is, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was always my favorite way to smoke
flyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually started telling all my friends
that come to FCP to bring a bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from now on, you'll probably start
seeing some heavy bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sovereignty glass, if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also always like vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, dude, I love my volcano.
[SPEAKER_03]: Volcano is cool, but there's a vaporizer
in Amsterdam that I think is the best.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the sublimator?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the, oh, you just kind of
threw me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it right on the fucking tip of my
tongue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Verdamper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Verdamper, that sounds sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the verdamper.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of a verdamper.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the type behind that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's essentially like a hookah,
but it's a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't have like a tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of them, I guess,
maybe do have a hose.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the traditional one is like a large
glass apparatus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you kind of put a heating element
that's all glass over a large bowl,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it just sits over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so smooth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I loaded it with so much weed,
and it just perfectly ground that shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to show off the action.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's rocking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get yourself a flour mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you cover it with your hand and let it
off like that to give it a carb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's got a huge bubble and then a
big mouthpiece that comes off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can order them and have them over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend has one here in the United
States.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're in almost every coffee shop,
and I love those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really great vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little different topic right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I'm in the middle of reading
your book right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where are you in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm literally on chapter two.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just started literally two nights ago
when I had free time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, Peter gave me the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just read through the first
monologue and then getting into the first
[SPEAKER_06]: chapter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm very, very pleased.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't read a book in over five or six
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is literally the first book.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Peter, let me get that book.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's some good stories in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a funny story, and there's some
scary stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly the scary stories, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pass it around to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pass it around to all my
friends and bring it back home to South
[SPEAKER_06]: Carolina and let my friends read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to give the book to any community
where it's going to get passed around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did a van convention in Bisbee,
Arizona, and I gave my book to a local
[SPEAKER_03]: guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's going to make the rounds
in the community out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already in my possession.
[SPEAKER_06]: Famous in little towns.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me two weeks, maybe more.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a small book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll do a book review.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do a book review.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that'd be sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be super sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was very open.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I started writing the book,
I'm like, am I going to get arrested?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wasn't sure if I'd get arrested
for some of those stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love how this man has the peach cobbler
live rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually have some peach cobbler
rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe a little testy test.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flour mill, let's roll a fatty joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a dabber?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need a little Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're passing me a dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you need a grinder, get yourself
a flour mill on the dog Academy website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dog a dog gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to get it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is fucked.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to I got to roll you another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't pass off a joint with any floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go for the next one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's good company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Round two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I know him or not,
but I've seen the product.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had him on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first time I met him a couple
of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the secret club.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually met some of these people
that I think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they came to an event or
they know me from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love it when that's the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, there's plenty of people that
have no idea of my story at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's cool, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's always nice when you meet
somebody that does know a little part of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's it called when they like
take the wax off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you act right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see no better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to crystallize something when
they're smelling that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is what you brought?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought glazed peaches batter from
Absolute Extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Albert Walker, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and if you guys want to dab,
please go for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I'm off camera, guys, but my
feedback is that this Albert Walker is
[SPEAKER_09]: smoking excellent off the first few puffs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out Golden Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is usually how it is for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Class man standing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it comes from the old
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd smoke every kind of thing,
and you'd just learn to hang.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
