[SPEAKER_00]: What up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everyone's having a good Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just figured I'd give a little garden
update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna flip this next week,
probably around the 10th or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I gotta get in here, clean up the
lowers, take homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went back to one layer of trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did bamboo last time, and so trying
to figure out the best system for these
[SPEAKER_00]: big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think last time I ran three to four
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time we're doing two plants just in a
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of imitating outdoor production,
just giving them as much root space as
[SPEAKER_00]: they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just feeding plain water on the
drip tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it comes on two hours every two
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps things moist, so they practically
grow themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system, I wish I would have been here
from the get-go, but sometimes you gotta
[SPEAKER_00]: take the long route.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw some hay down, so we got grass
growing, which is no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just trim that back and throw another
layer of straw or local hay, so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-swayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just from friends pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do get weed seed, but I'm not too
worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, as you can see, the reason I
threw the trellis on was because my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind of getting big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice just to train them down,
so you have an even canopy, multiple tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything got topped twice, and then it's
just kind of been bending and keeping them
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat even, especially these taller
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's a little smaller
phenohunt than I would typically do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're running only 20 plants,
probably, for each run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them I'm taking, going back
through, like my mango tree, the Jaffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what I like to do is I'll do kind
of like, just to take a peek and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it's something that I really
like, then we'll grow out a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like this, I've got my mango tree up
here in the front right, and then our
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaffee, which is a Seba by Cometonic Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got High Alpine's Lemon Cookie Dough,
and then his Pineapple Sugar Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just likes to grow some length to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here we've got Bubba G,
which is a CBG variety from Swiss,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured out what was going on with this
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just getting a little too
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to check it out and try and
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try and train that big old
bush over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of fill in the gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got his CBDV from Swiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I'm excited for this
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should come down probably beginning
of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I still got that monster tobacco
plant that's growing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just did a couple leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now she's just a catch for fungus
nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a pretty simple system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did columns of BioLive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far that's all the amendments we've
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just growing and recycling soil that's
probably a couple years to five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're loving life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've only boiler sprayed once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of grasshopper damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use pretty minimal boiler sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to keep it the cheapest possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do like the SUP Oil X, which is
just like a mineral oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like the potassium fatty salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like horticultural soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micronized sulfur usually will do that
maybe once in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add a little bit of that to your
spray just to give it a lightly coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to do that too close to
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically I'll do one more spray and
just kind of rinse them off after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe with a zero tall or like a isopropyl
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to kind of clean them and do a light
pesticide spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there you have it.
