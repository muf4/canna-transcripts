[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was so beautiful out here
today that I'd take you around and show
[SPEAKER_00]: you, take you on a garden tour,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with this strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This strawberry, we used to have several
rows of this stuff and when we got these
[SPEAKER_00]: ducks that I'm about to turn loose,
they destroyed most of it and I just had
[SPEAKER_00]: like a few pieces of it that I saved and
nursed it back to health last year and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's all we got but at least
we're getting strawberries this year so
[SPEAKER_00]: happy about that and it should be plenty
of them and yeah looks looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay show you the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I'll turn these chickens loose
too so he's not squawking as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rooster's lucky to be alive right now
and I'll show you why at the end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pretty though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this is the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's horseradish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is wonderful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like strong flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff's great on a sandwich or if you
like cocktail sauce, it's the secret
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient in cocktail sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposedly good for you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this is the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dumped an entire, I don't know if you
can see that well from way over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that worm bin right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show it to you here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dumped that entire thing in here and
this mulch right here really, it retains
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the, it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do very little watering after the plants
get past this stage right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those are actually big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can move that mulch in on them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah those, when they're tiny,
I water them a little bit at night and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that they stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, but after that, all of these grass
clippings really take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to do any watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let the rain do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a snap peas that have been through
duck problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they keep sniffing them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I planted another row out further,
but they didn't germinate as well as these
[SPEAKER_00]: original ones that did because they ate
most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the little duck holes right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so you got carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna thin those out once they get just a
little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinach, lettuce, mustard greens right
here, and turnips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turnip greens because I don't really like
the turnips so much, but I do like the
[SPEAKER_00]: greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a bunch of stuff to plant in
here later on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cool weather crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I dumped this entire worm bin in to
there and I just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it covered it like several inches thick
and then I rebuilt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, much nicer than the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never touching it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pulling stuff out of the front of it
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just planted these tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the tomatoes out front too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just in a few days and I had to
cover them up a few days ago for a frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a bunch more that are going into
that garden along with some of this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of seeds that I'm gonna be
planting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my habanero.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a triploid boxcar willy tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three cotyledons on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an ornamental sage like salvia blue
midnight or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that the wife likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my basil and all of this stuff is
flowering because it's been sitting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking them in and out for over
a month now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are raspberries, heritage
raspberries, a bunch of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: flat leaf parsley, cilantro, and this is
black lights 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take you around front.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the ducks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the ducks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hanging out in our little meadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the last of the dogwood tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blooms anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a nice little spot back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to mow it until we have to because
it's so beautiful back here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our little meadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ducks love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bothering them right now so I'll leave
them alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a tomato incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those basil and the peppers that I
just showed you went through it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all went through hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a north wind that came through
in the middle of the day that I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started off at like in the mid fifties and
it's supposed to end in the mid fifties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the middle of the day, a cold wind
came through and like destroyed a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: my tomato plants when they were young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to restart.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them survived and it was just two
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sue, and I can't remember what the other
one was, but mainly just two varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: made it this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I replanted a whole bunch and
look at these little guys playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're happy out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you got way too many tomatoes
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you this little bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chicken had her neck ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that bad rooster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had, you can't get chickens worked
on because they, the vets that work on
[SPEAKER_00]: birds only do like fancy birds,
like parrots and geese and swans and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't mess with chicken and duck
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're low class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to do stuff on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this little bird had her neck ripped
by that big bad rooster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to super glue it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only not even two weeks old and
she's got feathers growing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's showing up on the
camera or not either, but these little
[SPEAKER_00]: feathers are coming back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's blood going to it and she's
acting normal and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitch her up with some super glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she's going to come out here to have a
day by herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y 'all have a nice day too.
