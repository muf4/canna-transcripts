[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you wake up, and you feel like you
need a little up.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're down and out, and you need to
get a little higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you feel like you need a blessing,
and you feel a little high today,
[SPEAKER_04]: welcome to the Church of Cali High.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cali High.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cali High.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Cali High Season 6,
Episode 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week we visit Rancho Verde Farms,
close to Harvest, and talk with my old
[SPEAKER_01]: friend Peter G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out on the California Coastal Plains,
Peter G.
[SPEAKER_01]: has a medical grow at Rancho Verde Farm,
where it gets sun all day from sunrise to
[SPEAKER_01]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take a stroll with Peter through the
garden, and learn some of his clever
[SPEAKER_01]: growing techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter has been a friend of mine for 44
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in an avant-garde band,
called the Dada's in the late 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in recent years he has been a mentor
to me, helping me with my grow and sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: his knowledge, expertise, and techniques
of growing high quality, healthy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter is a drummer, and after the garden
visit, we compose a small duet for drums
[SPEAKER_01]: and melodica, of which several clips are
interspersed in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fun episode to watch,
if just to watch us circle the garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: uncover gems of knowledge while checking
out Peter's grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention the musical repartee,
between us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: KZ OG, classic OG look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needs three more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is a classic OG look?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that indica, usually kind of dark
green, and the edges of the leaves fold
[SPEAKER_02]: up, and you get little snow drifts on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think that my Romaggio has
those characteristics as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, you can see the way the leaves do
that on the ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has the same look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter always has the nicest looking
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see any.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG KZ, a very hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very forgiving, very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super sturdy branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow big.
[SPEAKER_01]: KZ OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG KZ, KZ OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave me from, what was the name?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Guava Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Guava Gelato.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Yonsai.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks very similar, but it's even darker
green and very tight serrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reminds me of a Northern Lights I grew
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to have a butt of that because I
didn't even grow any myself, just to taste
[SPEAKER_01]: it when it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it looking?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it smelling, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells indica-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, rub some of the...
Freakness.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a limey terpene, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that lime in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Guava Gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the guy's name?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to refer to him as Yonsai.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice, but see, it's growing just like
you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just put it, before I put it on
the ground, there's also a cage in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground so the gophers can't get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I did that, I dug like 20
gallons out and put some, it's old soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: and put some of that tomato fertilizer in
there and then wet it and then set it on
[SPEAKER_02]: top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's growing into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow into the ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow trees if you grow in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: More forgiving, too, because it always has
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the soil here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well... It's like sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super fine and hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It holds water forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so you have to mend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like sand that you dig down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I take the net off, I let him go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's going to be ready real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see this, when the sun gets over
there, it just gets all white.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the tall ones in the back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go around this way and then
we'll get to the back, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which way do you want to go, Petey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, this is... The fruity tree blue
king.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dynamic smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It produces pungent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the flavor pungent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your favorite flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruity like grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's more of a sativish looking,
whereas this one's more OG looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: This reminds me of something old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something old.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more OG looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more the fluffier sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly a 70 Indica 30 sativa mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it grows like sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fingers are all sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's even sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both three blue kings?
[SPEAKER_02]: Different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about your pruning method,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, I stripped the bottoms
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look right through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come out here and see the ants going up,
and you're going, ah!
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I got the tangle foot, tangle foot,
tangle foot, no way up into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they get up there, boy,
they go on the highway, and they just will
[SPEAKER_02]: spread out through all the... The canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even my ropes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are they doing up there when they
do go up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: They farm aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they turn into a scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aphid scale, I'm not sure what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the scale is a different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they farm those too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They milk those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they put out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aphids are different than the scale,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also three blue kings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fertilize this again today because it's
still fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still fluffy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got these long hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're variable up top, but, you know,
it's a lot of popcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluffers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs two more weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all white still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hairs are already... Yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flushing for a week or two already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes out like... Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your harvest time becomes more like the
valleys.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a drier climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes more like my harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still wet in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it wet in the morning out where you
live?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a little dew on the leaves and they
form on the tips of the ridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not on the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a three blue kings too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how thick that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the size of my freaking head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unreal, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needy, fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking her down soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's gonna start rotting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think she's ready to go,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, there's hardly any white hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a little white hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take down the top buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look a little bit around underneath.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trippy, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be like a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get out the scope and look at the
trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: She was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember she was young.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had the fattest leaves of all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're thinning out in the bud
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that funny how they do that?
I've
[SPEAKER_02]: never had a three blue kings looking like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so massive right there,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like eight inches across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are thunkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, big giant clunkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of has the donkey dick structure,
but not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the buds are so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whereas you see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's that one again?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that we went to just there with
the white hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three blue kings, same as this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's later.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to pull a shade over here so you
can get some light up under it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just flash on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we got light in here, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Petey, you want to tell us about your
reflective medium?
[SPEAKER_02]: More lumens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is that stuff, Petey?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, now you can really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me take a still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a nice afternoon breeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice the airless paint sprayer for polar
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Handiest thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives a fine mist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get home with it with a little
sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three blue kings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three blue kings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three months and three days old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this was just.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's for people that haven't actually
watched a prior episode with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter G of Casa Verde Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rancho Verde.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rancho Verde.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started them in the cloth pots here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they grow, I can shift them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one I want to plant where you just
drop them right in the soil and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: grow right through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you built these beds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I started in a little cloth pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually I dropped it into the 20 gallon
cloth pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do cut slits in the bottom of the pots,
but they still grow right through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The handiest thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did that my first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of your tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I pushed soil all around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, put some kind of reconstituted
amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you have to water all three of
those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use water right into the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of it stays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moist also though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the outer soil also stays
moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I water it outside the thing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I water, I pour like four gallons in
and I pour two or three gallons around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes seven or eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some I do 12 gallons for the bigger
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how often do you water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're in a pot and they're not in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I have to do them every day to every
other day, if I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, letting it dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm picking it tomorrow because it's just
too dense and it's starting to rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Black dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an off to the side pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was started in like one gallon and then
I put it in like a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept them dropping into bigger cloth
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentric rings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it harder for an ant to crawl in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, speaking of ants, what is your ant
deterrent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller pots and I just keep dropping it
into a bigger pot and you're just filling
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use white plastic too.
[SPEAKER_01]: To keep the heat off your pots,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little bit of tangle foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tangle foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe like pine tar you get in
hardware stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first you put a little tape around it
and then you put it on the tape,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you let the ants live in the pots
because they're good for the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make little trails and they also eat
other insects from living in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just as long as they don't come up
into the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they cannot get up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they find their way up this pole
and along this wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In here they did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came up this pole over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way for them into the canopy
without having to go over this goo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got all these goo there, goo there and
also here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which I leaned into earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every pole in there has the little goo
around the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can't get up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see they're all stuck on it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some kind of insect stuck on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something stuck on it right there anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you were saying, this year there's
less insects, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In general?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got aphids, but they come off the bamboo
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got my bug sprayer out,
my airless and sprayed all the bamboo on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other side of my enclosure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bogan V, it doesn't pose any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be all open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I planted the Bogan V and the
yuccos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what do we got here, Petey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another three blue kings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many three blue kings do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like five?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have the concentric circles of
potty and the outer bed of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I started off in a plastic pot and
I just sliced it down the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have taken it off, but it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I cut the bottom off it and sliced
it all the way down one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dropped it in the pot, another pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in here it's growing into 200
gallons of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it gets so big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots grow forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Takes 12 gallons every time I water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let me ask you another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the season, do you pull the
pots out of the beds?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I let the roots rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just at the beginning and next season,
I'll just twist the stem out of the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and mix it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get a new bag of a couple cubic
feet of new soil, which is I've been using
[SPEAKER_02]: Aurora original mix or something anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put that in the pots and all the
stuff around it is reconstituted soil from
[SPEAKER_02]: the year before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next year I'll push it off into that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I carry it out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you put the amendment in the old
soils, Home Depot, tomato, whatever they
[SPEAKER_02]: call it, which is organic with microbes
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one I just dropped on another pot and
she's going down into the other one,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, she's very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She looks very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go, there's no cut through kind of,
is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little tanning help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see what I'm filming, but I hope
I'm getting this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three pounds of fluff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year my three pounds of fluff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the jazz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just goes like haze, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very strong smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: The THC trichomes are actually smaller on
the tree blue Kings where some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica's are big trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is very, it's very stony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, let's get it from this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's big, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's under here, Peter Morsoil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just waiting for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over here it gets blocked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice having an open space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been three months, three months and
three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the plant do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something must be done right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 days, Petey?
[SPEAKER_01]: From seed to fucking bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you did start late.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them are kind of massive,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of all your fertilizer, what you would
say, how much percentage is organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: I start out using advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their full line of grow and I use very
little nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also using in between liquid nutrient
feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will use Aurora dry nutrient feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole feed schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't seem to get them as hardy as I
can when they start budding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I switched to only organic Aurora
dry nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something looks like it was done right
here for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole garden actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a flushing agent from advanced
nutrients called Flawless Finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good or bad, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything they do seems to work pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think going this way is probably not the
best idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come down the other rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, Petey?
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant there is another one of those
KZs, which you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one here?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Indico influence, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where some have that OG influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the one next to it's sugary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you planted all these at the same time
or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I started later, like a week or
like June 25th or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably some of the smaller ones,
who knows.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is
[SPEAKER_01]: a vertical stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always like, I better plant a few
more because I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you end up with too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you don't want to kill any of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had very small plants this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm except for my own genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have to grow smaller in
my own little hoop house anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, uh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuck in between a rock and a hard spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just smoked a joint of your delicious
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Document that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked a joint of my delicious weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been in my freezer for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulled it out last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been in the refrigerator since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freaking amazing blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a giant KZ from the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is the Three Blue Kings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three Blue Kings, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had the biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very fruity, but floral smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to squeeze your buds so
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate when people do that to my buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how sugary these are.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the KZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they call OG looking,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of leafy little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The green is the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green is the color of the OG plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at those leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say OG has a sativa element,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a pure 80% indica or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: A black dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always produces quick, very quick this
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already harvested one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very beautiful from the inside here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a giant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the way it's all spread out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giant fan leaves in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every branch is tied up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the fucking wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to tie up some of mine as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the buds flop on each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back out of this row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Three Blue Kings smells like some old
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fruity and floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it right here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that one over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for that one, which is the KZ OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massive growing strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get three different, four different
phenols from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of them smells a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one last year though, and it had the
pungent flavor like the old Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Used to taste from Dr. Green thumb when he
first had it tasted unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, pungent is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that word sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend's girlfriend used to say it
smelled like burning liver when you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burning liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like burning leather.
[SPEAKER_01]: A burning leather.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a kind of an interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I prefer my Formaggio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheese smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheese taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what haven't we seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's down here, Petey?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberry on the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the blueberry right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the one to your right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also that KZ OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to like walk into a place
that's of hazard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This blueberry muffin looks exquisite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger than my blueberry muffin buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small, slow plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started it the same time as those three
blue things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at the one to your right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the meat and.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another freaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calyxes are giant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like that three blue kings with
the massive buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta be a loose tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when do you start to defoliate,
Peter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I already have on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have definitely up in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it's only sparse leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crowded somewhere on the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pull some of the leaves out and
constantly I cut branches off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that one had no room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were big, long branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in the way to walk through here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were some of the slower plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the beautiful purple color on the
three blue things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had stems that purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my Formaggio ad Zura strain has
completely red stem leaf stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a purple leaf stem without fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get buds that were purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple buds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The calyxes were actually purple.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've got that one plant with the
pink hairs all over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the squirt that I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has purple in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is totally purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean the one that takes after the
blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch me light this plant up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one over here with the shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one here is pretty impressive too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a different more OG-ish looking,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same strain but different looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the fluff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's fucking pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope I don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I go south some.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the biggest producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are pretty thunky thunkers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Petey.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are massive compared to my paltry
garden.
But.
[SPEAKER_01]: My phone is completely sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year my favorite plant was the fluffy
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the pungent one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me smell that one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a different kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the edge over here, Peter,
you have the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in the pots again?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one with bud rot is a what?
Black dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where do you get the black dog seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt seed organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've only.
[SPEAKER_01]: The source of all your plants are two
organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guava gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guava gelato looks pretty nice though,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make my best luck with the organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how green it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super healthy looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was flushing it for two weeks and it
wouldn't get yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually fertilized it again today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these outside ones I play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did something right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing in a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty nice, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what mine should look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I dropped it in the 20 gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be the weather here has something to
do with these, but I think it's more of
[SPEAKER_01]: your growing technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got smaller buds, smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd listen to what I told you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I just listen, OK, just listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try next year is going to
be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow the simple schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down in your little mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just go, OK, this needs this on this
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course you watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it shows some sign of stress,
like all your hair start turning brown,
[SPEAKER_02]: start flushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, because they will turn brown if
with heat or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, too many nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, when I was flushing this pot,
I tested the runoff and it was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1900 PPM like wow, oh my gosh,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot, maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember some outrageous number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indicating that it's got too much in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last runoff I got when I flushed it
was like 900 or the one before it anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like enough water, you're starting to turn
brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this middle one is what is this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another KZ OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it usually looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same as this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look how block to me is the classic
OG structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry muffin looks like it's a
lighter color, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And pinkish you see pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also got the red same thing as last
year on the bigger shade leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it needed some more of
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing like malnourished like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can fertilize the fuck out of it and put
dry organic nutrients on it and.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just flushing it looks like candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was a great tour of the garden
PD and thanks a lot.
Thanks for watching.
