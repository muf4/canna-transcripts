[SPEAKER_00]: hey how's it going today is October 12th
it's starting to finally feel like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: autumn and wanted to show you we've shown
some videos before on our layered
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting technique that I know a lot of
other people use but wanted to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: how we do it and the benefits of doing a
layered harvest so first of all oh and by
[SPEAKER_00]: the way this is a Thai plant that we've
been running for a number of years this is
[SPEAKER_00]: our absolute favorite plant for doing
sativa tinctures has a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoony effect so if you like the silly
cartoony giggly effect this plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: take you there so anyway it's it's a
favorite anyway so this plant so the
[SPEAKER_00]: layered harvesting system is when you have
outdoor plants that are like yay big but
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter what size but the basic
concept is this plant used to be about
[SPEAKER_00]: this big and so the top outer colas would
get ready and ripen first so we just take
[SPEAKER_00]: those top colas off and the plant take it
down about two feet and then the other
[SPEAKER_00]: colas the inside flowers will then get
more sunlight and they'll mature and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get nice and big and fat and then you take
those and you just keep doing that until
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got nothing left on the plant so
this actually today we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the third harvest off this
particular plant and just I'm going to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: this and bring it to the camera to see but
let me know if it when it goes in focus so
[SPEAKER_00]: basically right here this bud you know a
few weeks ago was just tiny little larvae
[SPEAKER_00]: popping corn that had nothing but now that
it's been exposed to the sunlight and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to develop it's now this really
beautiful dense cola like you could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually trim this up as a flower so
anyway so that's kind of how this works
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're going to take this whole plant
down to nothing but I'll show you another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant so here's another Thai plant same
situation and just yeah just look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal on there so and the concept being
that if we would have harvested the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant all at once and taken the whole
plant out of here all of this would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been very small little popcorn almost
unusable buds but by letting that these
[SPEAKER_00]: small inner buds now have their time in
the Sun and their time to shine they've
[SPEAKER_00]: totally delivered and so now just this one
branch here got some these are like top
[SPEAKER_00]: colas at this point where a few weeks ago
they were just like larvae popcorn that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd almost throw away so anyway you can
get sort of triple or quadruple the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: of really killer flower if if you're
interested in doing just sort of this
[SPEAKER_00]: layered harvest so today we're gonna be
taking all these plants down to just a
[SPEAKER_00]: stock so we're actually starting to close
out our garden at least stuff that's ready
[SPEAKER_00]: but like this is a Nigerian plant that
we're growing for the fun of it this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing's not even gonna be this is gonna be
more like Christmas but anyway all right
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's the layered harvest concept
we're gonna get on with our harvesting so
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a wonderful hey just
wanted to show one more example of this
[SPEAKER_00]: tie these buds if we would have harvested
the entire plant all at once these would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been tiny little larvae nothing buds
but now I hope you can see that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know this camera doesn't always focus on
the right thing maybe it's focused on my
[SPEAKER_00]: nose hairs instead of the plant but yeah
these are just killer like trophy buds
[SPEAKER_00]: that yeah just given that inner popcorn
buds a few weeks to mature just get
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing amazing amazing so anyway I'm
impressed so I hope that helps some folks
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy you you you you you
