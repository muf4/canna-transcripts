Welcome to the Church of Cali High!
Cali High!
Cali High!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Cali High episode 67,
catching up with Armin of LA Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Chenzo Nico, and this week
we check back in with Armin Peronian,
[SPEAKER_00]: CEO of LA Cannabis, to talk about the
legal state of cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Armin is a board member of the United
Cannabis Business Association here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern California, and we discuss his
dealings with state legislators regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: issues of cannabis tax, regulation,
and licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out about various bills proposed
to make cannabis laws less onerous and
[SPEAKER_00]: more fair, and discover where the industry
is currently, where it's headed,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the future of cannabis
nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He explains why LA Cannabis has recently
made the switch to organic soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: five-gallon grow bags after using Rockwell
cubes for over a decade in a hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Armin also tells us about the new strains
he has and the lower prices favoring
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for a talk with one of the most
knowledgeable people in cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi folks, it's Chenzo here from Cali High,
and I'm sitting here today with Armin
[SPEAKER_00]: Peronian of LA Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Armin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well, Vincent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is like our fourth interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is the fourth one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must be a fan favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, you are a fan favorite, and one of
the most knowledgeable people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis business today, I would have to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of the cannabis business,
let's just get an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the state of the cannabis business,
the legal cannabis business today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now, cannabis is definitely
going through turmoil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a large price compression that's
happening in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for consumers, it's obviously a good
thing because the price of legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: is coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, given the taxes,
it still has a lot of room to go because
[SPEAKER_02]: the government's taken a good chunk of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the price per gram is down
substantially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So consumers are able to purchase legal
tested product at about the price of the
[SPEAKER_02]: illicit market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So industry wise, a lot of turmoil because
the operators and the business operators
[SPEAKER_02]: have to adapt, pivot, look internally and
kind of reevaluate their business and
[SPEAKER_02]: their company and try to see where they
fit in today's market as far as the price
[SPEAKER_02]: point and how that compares to their
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have friends that are going out
and getting ACE for 25 and they're calling
[SPEAKER_00]: me up.
Hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, that's good for, like I said,
like you say, the consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are in California and I thought
to myself, you're LA cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how does LA compare to something
like another city, another municipality
[SPEAKER_00]: like San Francisco?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different markets, LA, obviously the
county is a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our market is bigger compared to the
San Francisco market.
[SPEAKER_02]: San Francisco was earlier to license
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're on additional rounds of
licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have oversaturated their
market a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot more delivery licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tax rates are different as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we differ in taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: LA has some of the highest taxes in the
state, but, you know, it's a different
[SPEAKER_02]: market in the sense that the cities laid
out different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't have an area with too many
dispensaries and an area with not a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's happening in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: LA did one thing correct is they went by
community plan area and the community plan
[SPEAKER_02]: determines the density of the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they based how many licenses are
allowed in an area based off of the
[SPEAKER_02]: density, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Population density, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So some areas of the valley are a lot less
dense than areas in Hollywood or downtown
[SPEAKER_02]: LA, East LA or South LA have more dense
pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've opened more licenses in those
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think San Francisco went off of a
cap or they went off of zoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a bunch of them have been bundled into
one area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have these pockets where
there's not too many dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does California compare to other
states?
[SPEAKER_02]: California is a free market is what they
call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state does not have a limit on how
many licenses can be issued versus some
[SPEAKER_02]: states who are, they call limited
licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the state has said, okay, 20 licenses,
10 licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Florida, they only have 13
licenses in the whole state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very limited license.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the bigger multi-state operators
control those licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a monopoly or limited
license, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a free market because limited
opportunity, right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So limit up to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered a free market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state does not have a cap on the
licenses long as the local authorizes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have plenty of municipalities
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have no cap on the local licenses as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: City of LA has a soft limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they also have a limit on the
cannabis, the cultivation canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some restrictions here,
but a lot more free market than some
[SPEAKER_02]: states that have a very restricted
licensing limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does a dispensary in LA pay as
far as taxes go?
[SPEAKER_02]: So city of LA is one of the highest taxed
municipalities in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, last year they removed the
cultivation tax, which was a backend tax
[SPEAKER_02]: that the consumers did not get to see
because it was baked into the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had assembly bill 195.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the number of the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that did was it eliminated the
cultivation tax and it moved the tax to
[SPEAKER_02]: the retail point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it moved the excise tax,
which was also baked into the wholesale
[SPEAKER_02]: price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they made it based off of the
whole retail ticket price.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it turned a complicated tax system into
a more complicated tax system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the legislators thought it was a tax
relief for the industry, but ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up increasing the taxes by a couple
of percent because what it did was the law
[SPEAKER_02]: was vague on clarifying local versus state
tax and how that was going to be taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you have a excise tax that's
baked into the cost of the good,
[SPEAKER_02]: and when a local charges a tax,
they get to charge that tax on tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now the state went and turned the tax
into like a use tax that gets taxed at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have a conflict with local and
state saying, oh, I'm the last taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the state saying I'm the last
taxed, the local saying they're the last
[SPEAKER_02]: taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a conflict.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now operators are left with trying to
figure out who to pay the tax to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It created a lot of conflict.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what that said, when you aggregate the
taxes and you stack them on one another,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way the state has taken that position
that you have to stack the taxes on one
[SPEAKER_02]: another, it's a tax on tax on tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a hundred dollar product will first you
need to charge the local tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is $10 in city of LA would be 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you would tax the 15% excise on the
110.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would charge the 9.5% sales
tax on the total with the local and the
[SPEAKER_02]: excise included.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a tax on tax on tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ultimately increased the price of
the product and it turned a $100 item that
[SPEAKER_02]: you would pay a 15% before you would pay a
20, let's say it was a 20, if a $100 item
[SPEAKER_02]: was a $50 wholesale, the tax would be
around $13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's gonna be about $15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you take the aggregated
additional taxes, you're looking at a few
[SPEAKER_02]: more dollars for the consumer at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on top of being a really high tax
compared to other states, we went ahead
[SPEAKER_02]: and made it more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it needs to be really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I know LA Cannabis grows its own
cannabis, which is top-notch folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did getting rid of the cultivation
tax affect you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously- And you have your retails,
so- Yeah, no, it definitely, for
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators, getting rid of the
cultivation tax was a good relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry needed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cultivation tax was based off of
weight, which no other industry gets taxed
[SPEAKER_02]: that way per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the price of cannabis started
plummeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at some of the greenhouse
product, it's wholesaling around $250 in
[SPEAKER_02]: some times of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the tax, I think is $160 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a $250 pound being taxed $160.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was an easy sell to
legislators like, hey, we can't be taxing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis by the pound because the price
fluctuates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, they didn't take into account the
fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they went ahead and made that
correction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a nice relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they kind of took it and flipped
it to the retail side with the excise
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bill kind of actually complicated
the taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't really, I don't think it
necessarily helped with relief for the
[SPEAKER_02]: overall industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think the consumers got to see
the benefits of the tax reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was other things that are
driving the price down, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: the tax fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the legal cultivators that have no
other business benefited mainly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it didn't necessarily improve
their business as well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if the price was already coming
down, I don't think that was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cultivators might have seen some
relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: The greenhouse outdoor cultivators saw
relief.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate Bill 512.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us about that and what's up
with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senate Bill 512.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a little background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a state legislative committee
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very involved in what goes on in
cannabis bills in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a part of the United Cannabis Business
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the executive board there and I sit
on the legislative committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm constantly digesting bills and how
it affects cultivators and retailers
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm involved in both spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of my friends in the industry
have asked me to be involved in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very involved in Senate Bill 512.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senator Bradford is championing that bill
for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is, is it's a fix to AB 195,
which is the bill that got rid of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is going to fix the tax on tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to allow locals and states
to stack the taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to address some of the
penalty issues because cannabis tax,
[SPEAKER_02]: most taxes or almost all taxes in
California that are paid to CDTFA.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're late a day or you miss a
payment, it's a 10 percent penalty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a 50 percent penalty,
which is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you make an error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your accountant drops the ball,
doesn't file the taxes on the 31st like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 percent penalty, which is just not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other industry where that
type of penalty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No other industry would put up with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis industry is abused in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not as organized.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as well funded as some other
industries that have consolidated,
[SPEAKER_02]: that have all the resources needed to make
sure their industry is not choked out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis is not there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I kind of volunteer a lot of
my time and get involved in these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But SB 512 is not going to fix the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to fix some of the problems
that were caused by another bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely an important fix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll save the consumers on a hundred
dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can save them anywhere, four to six
dollars, depending on the municipality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to fix a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: AB 195 actually didn't specify,
but was not clear in defining delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what CDTFA did was assume that delivery
fees are now included in the total
[SPEAKER_02]: receipt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're actually taxing excise on
delivery fees now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CDTFA has put out guidelines
saying that you have to tax excise on
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing that was a problem
that was created by AB 195, which SB 512
[SPEAKER_02]: fixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually delivery customers will be
saving a lot more if this bill actually
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it through and gets on the Senate
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually in a different,
it's in the tax and finance committee
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, if I have the committee right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got another hurdle to go through
and then it'll be on the Senate floor for
[SPEAKER_02]: a vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already made it through the Senate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's in assembly right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it needs to check some of the boxes
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully it'll be a fix for some of
the problems the industry is dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the chances of it passing,
do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it passed Senate committees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, has some hurdles right now because
it's in the tax committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the opponents of the bill are
arguing that the intent of the Prop 64 was
[SPEAKER_02]: to tax, put the sales tax on top of all
the taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of not the true story
behind this bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bill fixes a lot of other things and
Senator Bradford, who's championing the
[SPEAKER_02]: bill has offered to make changes to some
of the opponent's arguments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the opponents are not willing to
budge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the bill to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were kind of, there's that fight
happening actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was emailing senators yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon as I leave from here, I'm going to
make a few phone calls as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there is a chance the bill gets
heard on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, things in Sacramento are
really last minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things will pop up and next thing you
know, your bill's being heard in 24 or 48
[SPEAKER_02]: hours and you got to get ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All hands on deck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think cannabis needs a larger unity
as far as the legal business and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the industry is divided in
some way cause we have the cultivators,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have the distributors and we have the
retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there are areas where there's
different interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that divide is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are areas where we have the same
interest and the industry can come
[SPEAKER_02]: together, but it's really capital,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the money to organize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the money for the professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the money for the attorneys to
review these bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the money for people to be on the
ground in Sacramento monitoring these
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all, it takes bodies and it takes
effort and it all costs the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed me an excise tax little
diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to explain that or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you posted about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CalNormal actually did a nice study and
they compared all the different taxes for
[SPEAKER_02]: other industries and beer is taxed at a
different rate, which is some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: lowest rates cause it's a lower priced
item.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's wine and then it's hard liquor
and then it's tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're like a hundred times more
than beer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 20 times more than wine,
15 times more than alcohol and like 10
[SPEAKER_02]: times more than tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industry is 14 cents and a joint
joint, half a gram joint, half a gram
[SPEAKER_02]: joint, a dollar 10, a dollar 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're paying about a 10 times more tax
on a half a gram joint than you are on a
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarette in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who is there any way to change that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what the industry is trying
to push for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously consumers have a say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people really underestimate the
power they have as a constituent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they think, oh, they can't make an
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's an issue that is affecting
you and you call your senators,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are obligated to take your call.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are obligated to respond to your
emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are here to serve the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear people underestimate the power
that they have sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you from experience,
senators and politicians, they have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: going on, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just one issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they can tackle an issue and not
have a bunch of complaints from
[SPEAKER_02]: constituents, they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it makes sense, they're going to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the consumers are another piece
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if you're a consumer,
the average smoker is probably spending
[SPEAKER_02]: 1500 to 2000 dollars a year on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 percent of that is going to the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a company says they did 800 dollars
of your money, it's going to be back in
[SPEAKER_02]: your pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to go back to the retailer
because that money never hits our books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we report our taxes to the IRS,
that money is not our money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never hits our books.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a company says they did a million
dollars in revenue, really, they brought
[SPEAKER_02]: in one point four and four hundred
thousand of that went to the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: California and the city that they're
operating in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really it's not our money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their money that's going to the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have every right to voice their
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other product that consumers
buy that's taxed so high?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you saw the you saw the breakdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no other consumer product kind of
ridiculous being taxed at that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another little government bit of
bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metric system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know growers have to use the metric
system.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering if you could explain
this tracking program and wondering if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have alternate ideas or proposals that
might lessen the onerous burden of the
[SPEAKER_02]: metric system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrap it.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, it's it's something that the
industry has taken on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's required.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's required by the federal government
for states to track the cannabis from
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going anywhere for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other states have taken other
approaches, which I think is more industry
[SPEAKER_02]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The California bill or law Prop 64
requires that the RFID tags are state
[SPEAKER_02]: issued.
[SPEAKER_02]: RFID?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the am I saying it wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way they're tagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a scanner in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very expensive because each plant has a
tag with a scanner in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a strip in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an ID scanner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little strip in it so that when
the state comes in, they can scan and see
[SPEAKER_02]: how many of those are in the room.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're used in all type of industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to purchase them from metric and
it's baked into our licensing cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I tell you what we pay for licensing,
people were astonished where our company's
[SPEAKER_02]: paying closely up to it's about two
hundred thousand dollars a year for
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing fees because most of that money
is going into these RFID tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tags are very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a city license or state?
[SPEAKER_02]: State licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: State license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for cultivation and retail and all
sorts of different license types that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to purchase these tags from
metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric bills the state and the state bills
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other states that allow
cultivators to purchase their own RFID
[SPEAKER_02]: tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they buy them directly from
manufacturers and they're substantially
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing I think the industry
is pushing for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, can we fix this that we don't have to
buy these tags from metric and find
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaper alternatives?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, metric doesn't like that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if the state I see the
state's point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be in control of the
situation better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it's financially
feasible to sustain this many tags that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're paying for because it's tens of
thousands of tags that are adding up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The larger cultivator, it's hundreds of
thousands of tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the economics behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the environmental side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plastic that we're wasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one is plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full of plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thick plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the cost side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the actual labor behind tagging
all these plants where I think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: simpler ways to track how many plants are
in a room digitally and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: have to have his physical tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I don't you know that most people are
like, I think there's better ways to do
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I don't want to knock what the state
has built, because at the time for at the
[SPEAKER_02]: speed in the way the program has been
rolled out, it was what was in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they made the decision that they had
to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think now is the time, I think,
with enough years under our belt,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like all the cannabis businesses have
to look internally and reconfigure their
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the state has to do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been at this for five years already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to know what's not working and we
have to make those changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can there be a lot of changes to the
metric system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric is a company, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric is a third party company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the software.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the software.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the contract with the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why should they also have the plastic
business?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's purchased through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some studies where it's about
10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some operators say that it's
about 10 times the cost of what you would
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to buy it on the free market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big portion of the licensing fees
go to the tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an issue that I think the industry
wants to tackle here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if enough people get together,
and it's really the state, because they
[SPEAKER_02]: are a vendor to the state.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not our vendor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a vendor to the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the state has to really reevaluate
that contract with Metric and how we can
[SPEAKER_02]: save some costs for the operators and save
some costs for the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe change it from plastic to
biodegradable paper maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or one tag per room, one tag per trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lower that footprint.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number is the number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the state walks in and you have 200
plants registered in a room and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: that difficult to count 200 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if there's a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the thought process behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're going to a two acre farm that
has 10,000 plants and you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators in there tag counting 10,000
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there has to be a better alternative
to maybe counting the rows or counting one
[SPEAKER_02]: tag and having that tag represent a
certain amount of plants.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a better solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the industry can come up with
there's AI, there's all type of different
[SPEAKER_02]: technology that can be looked at that's
going to save the industry money and not
[SPEAKER_02]: be such an environmental waste as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you said you're on the United
Cannabis Business Association's board.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the United Cannabis Business
Association up to lately and what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: like long term and short term goals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have been together as a group as
a trade association for seven years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've definitely we've done a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for the budget that we have the
group is putting in a lot of the executive
[SPEAKER_02]: board puts in a lot of their time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this mainly L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: based?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's statewide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a coalition between Long Beach
Dispensary, Santa Ana, the Coachella
[SPEAKER_02]: Valley and San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all have different members from all
those local organizations that participate
[SPEAKER_02]: in the state legislative committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the it started off as a local L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: based organization that put together an
organized retailer to get the measure and
[SPEAKER_02]: pass, which is the law that started the
licensing process for cannabis retail in
[SPEAKER_02]: the city of Los Angeles for adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've kind of just expanded into
the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we are I will go out on the
limb and say the leading cannabis trade
[SPEAKER_02]: association in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would argue that with any other
association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done a lot of work in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our executive director, Jonathan Kachkov,
I want to say his last name right,
[SPEAKER_02]: is doing an incredible job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our president, Jared Kylo, shows an
incredible job in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole executive team, the legislative
committee puts in a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Coachella Valley Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a part of it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jocelyn, she does great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she helps out a lot with everyone puts
in a little bit of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all volunteer work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one's getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just industry folks putting in
putting in the work, getting in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: these legislators to better the industry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That desperately needs regulatory watering
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulations need to be watered down
substantially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need some fixes so that this
industry can get out of this hole it's in
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think I sent you the
article about all the taxes that have not
[SPEAKER_02]: been paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about a half a billion dollars in
unpaid taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry is, you know, the business
operators are collapsing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consumer side thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers are going to get the best of the
best product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to get better product
than in California, anywhere else in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said this previously and I'll say it
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are not going to get a better product
anywhere in the world than California as a
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Business side, businesses are collapsing
and small businesses are getting the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small cultivators are getting the worst
end of the stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small retailers are getting the worst end
of the stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need a lot of fixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, someone has to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I made it the same decision to
do it because I enjoy the industry and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to keep doing it until I don't enjoy
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's that's my side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you guys collaborate with other
business associations, cannabis business
[SPEAKER_00]: associations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the other cities that I told you
about, they all have their local
[SPEAKER_02]: associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the Coachella Valley Cannabis
Network Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Long Beach Business,
Long Beach Cannabis Business Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Santa Ana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But UCBA kind of leads the way because we
have the experience in Sacramento.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I interviewed the Long Beach
Cannabis Business Association guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember his name right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's part of the legislative committee as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about Assembly Bill 1111.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that would that was to another
bill establish Farmers Markets for
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is this bill is back again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've the author has made three
attempts in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I as a retailer,
we have a problem with the bill because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very vague on a lot of the language
as far as local control goes and how these
[SPEAKER_02]: events are going to be coordinated,
licensed, tracked, monitored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a retailer, we think it's a little
unfair for cultivators to be allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: come into municipalities without a clear
definition of how they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: licensed and authorized to have an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: 32 times a year per license type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, if you take 32 events per
license type, the average cultivator
[SPEAKER_02]: probably has two or three licenses on
their premise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some have one, but some have two,
three, and some bigger producers have
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that part of the bill obviously needs
some fixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the retailers or UCBA or
myself are against the farmers market
[SPEAKER_02]: concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the the language behind the
bill and how the bill is going to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: be implemented or enforced.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have laws on the books now that are
absolutely not being enforced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another law on the bill that's not
going to enforce or be overseen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what does that mean for the
Department of Consumer Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Control?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they going to oversee these
events?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a lot of issues with
the bill and the authors do not want to
[SPEAKER_02]: amend the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have no choice but to oppose the
bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been fighting very hard against
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are the authors?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably a group of cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are not very transparent
in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: UCBA always puts their name behind
whatever bill they're supporting or
[SPEAKER_02]: opposing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the senator's name off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the assemblyman's name off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's cultivators, whether it's large
cultivators or small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd want to bet it's large cultivators and
I want to bet it's event companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to be able to host these events
and not go be in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not go through the compliance and the
regulatory process that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry has to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, that's an unfair advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go through regulatory processes
to retail in the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any municipality and from any place in
the state?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the vagueness of the bill,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the face of the bill,
it says the locals have control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So local authorities have control over
events already on the books, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in the event industry,
you know that process very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very difficult to throw an event
in Los Angeles or in most counties or most
[SPEAKER_02]: cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: How that affects cannabis regulatory,
it's very vague again, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to have cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the track and trace system.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it's ultimately doing is allowing
cultivators to be part-time retailers,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not the intent of the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created a system with cultivators,
distributors and retailers for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the voters voted for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it creates checks and balances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, can a person dabble into all sides of
the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to go through the regulatory
process, not this bill that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: create this pop-up scenario in an industry
that's already struggling with the illicit
[SPEAKER_02]: market thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we felt like there isn't enough
language in the bill for the regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: people or for regulators to have a clear
path to regulating these events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second argument is there's events
like that happening right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The law allows for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has to go through retailers
because they're the only one allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: sell to end consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the intent of the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for cultivators to say, oh,
we don't have access to customers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the retailers are the gatekeepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Events happen now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an event in Los Angeles two
weeks ago, the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers were there, retailers were
there, brands were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The track and trace has to go through a
retailer so that the state has a way of
[SPEAKER_02]: tracking this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the arguments for the bill are just not
true, at least in our opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll keep fighting the bill and we'll
see how that lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it more friendly for small-time
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not enough opposing the bill,
but the argument for the bill is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fishy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the Trojan horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really behind this bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to be having these
mass-ticketed events that these live
[SPEAKER_02]: nations and these big event companies are
going to just capitalize on and the farmer
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to just be there, pay to be
there, and give away cannabis or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: the arrangement is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the bill is not clear enough
and the authors are not willing to clarify
[SPEAKER_02]: their position.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the UCBA and a lot of the retailers
have taken an opposing position on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't see why it has to be an
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, regular farmers markets are on the
streets, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: On a Sunday afternoon or whatever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, cannabis can't be on the
streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is camera requirements.
Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're required to keep 90 days records
of all the transactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we submit for our license,
all the premise diagrams identify all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cameras and we go through a high level of
scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the vagueness in this bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how is an event going to hold 90 days
records of cameras?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing in the bill about any of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing about any of this
accountability that the retailers have to
[SPEAKER_02]: go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope we get that straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to call your local
assemblyman to oppose the bill?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you grow your own weed,
but what do you look for in other growers
[SPEAKER_00]: to get their weed on your shelves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's quality, quality, quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what we hold ourselves true
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what our customers know us for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have customers that have
been coming to our stores for over 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years, 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our customers, we have customers
that are here almost every day because
[SPEAKER_02]: they know if the product's on our shelf,
we stand behind the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not just going to bring any
product that paid us for a sliding fee or
[SPEAKER_02]: gave us some special to put on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: That quality matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as far as the brands go,
when the quality is there, we also look
[SPEAKER_02]: for brand support.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they going to do to drive some of
their existing customers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're going to advertise them to
our customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be some give and take.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to help sell their product as
well and then let their customers know
[SPEAKER_02]: about their product being available in our
stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely a business relationship
when we carry a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the quality is not there,
I'm sorry, whatever they're offering,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just ends up not cutting it because the
consumer doesn't necessarily know the
[SPEAKER_02]: brand, but they know our brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they drive by it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on their way to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around the corner from their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on their weed maps feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in their face and we're the point of
contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're where the transaction happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a product is bad or they have a bad
experience, they're not going to go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know where to find the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know where to find us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a retailer, we just can't have that
as the experience for our customers
[SPEAKER_02]: because we highly value our customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We highly value the lifespan of our
customer because acquiring customers is
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we invest in keeping the customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of our goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get pitch brands all the times,
even friends like I have to just play it
[SPEAKER_02]: off and be like, yeah, let me get a
sample, put it in front of the buyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the product just does not meet the
standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, they can't be on the
shelves if it doesn't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's good to know for all your
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of innovations is LA Cannabis
going to be making?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're constantly looking at ways to
reinvent ourselves business wise,
[SPEAKER_02]: making a lot of pivots and changes on the
business economics of things, figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: how we're going to play in this new
climate or as far as products,
[SPEAKER_02]: the price program and how that affects our
cash flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the business side, I'm constantly
working on ways to figure out how to adapt
[SPEAKER_02]: to the market situation because the bigger
market I can't control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to be able to control my
economics and how that works into the
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But products wise, we are constantly
looking for different strains to
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are making a big transition in
cultivation right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been growing in Rockwell for 15
years and we finally made the decision to
[SPEAKER_02]: transition to soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a big change for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to make a change into the way
our plant is grown, the size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be bigger with soil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What size bags are you going to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be growing in five gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is big change from where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: The labor side of it changes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more labor to go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a little bit less labor throughout the
process as far as the watering goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to make, we're making those
changes now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have about 30% of the rooms
transitioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they come down, we're making the
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there has to be some changes made to
the room's environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're redesigning our trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're redesigning our irrigation system to
fit this new change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And will the soil be like living soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a, we're working with Mother's
Finest Soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of the top quality soils on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is organic soil.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so managing the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of soil and we're in an urban
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So working with the suppliers,
securing that and having the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: delivered so it's not sitting around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot, it's different planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're making those changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already loving when I walk into the
rooms, the plants are just happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already have soil going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 30% of the rooms have already
been transitioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we'll have to come down and do
a little episode down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take some videos and I'll
post and I'll tag you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to repost on your page.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have plants and we have beds and
soil already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have rooms that have already flipped a
flower in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our first rooms in week one right
now in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely a different feel in the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just feel, it feels different,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The humidity is a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperatures are a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The height of the plant is completely
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be about two feet taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of changes on that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much yield difference will there be
per plant, you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're anticipating a 30% to 40% increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kept all our genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll continue to have our bank of
genetics that we're cultivating and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully expand into that kind of library
of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of the classic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very excited to see how our
existing strains are going to come out in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is going to be different,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our customers are going to see the
similarities, but they're also going to
[SPEAKER_02]: notice the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have a more full flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the flavor is going to be
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bud structure is going to be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yields are going to be better,
which is good for the economics of for our
[SPEAKER_02]: business and the lifespan of the company
right now with the price compression.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have bigger yields and the
process is a little longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the economics is different,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're going hydro,
you go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making the plants a little taller takes
a little bit more time, but we're adding
[SPEAKER_02]: veg space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to substitute that time
with more space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be able to stagger things out and
not miss a harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, we're just replanting
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're planning for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talked about new lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You used to use Govita, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've transitioned into the Govita LEDs
for the last year and a half, two years,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, where we've been on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were HPS in veg, and now we're
doing LED in veg as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing LED in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to lower the lights a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more veg space now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're maximizing our trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, we had some dead space because of
the type of trays we were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're putting in custom trays to
maximize every foot and still have the
[SPEAKER_02]: clearance needed for the fire department.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making a lot of changes, working a lot
of hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told my wife and my family, I'm like,
for the next 90 days, dad is not dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Husband is not going to be husband,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be a little preoccupied
with another family we have, our family of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you need help, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of genetics, let's talk about
your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a lot of legacy strains
and a lot of them, I know you just came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the new Bubba, the diagonal Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why it's called diagonal,
but the Bubba is freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Bubba crossed with the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's similar to our LA Con,
but different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have the LA Con.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in production right now,
so we kind of phase it in and out
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have the Bubba diagonal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Biscotti mince, which is like a
Cush mince, kind of hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing, came out amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sold out really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had done one row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a small batch under like
around 10 pounds and flew off the shelf,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we got that in rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bringing sour diesel back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a sour coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had sour in production for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of the OG strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the real sour diesel and it is a
difficult plant to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yields are not that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the industry doesn't produce
it, and you're not going to see it on
[SPEAKER_02]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the growing period is longer as
well, is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could go a little longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativas actually don't go as long,
but the plant is really tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to grow with other strains
because they just overpower the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're growing a lot of strains in
a room, it does an injustice to your other
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of like dominates it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we figured out a way to kind of
maintain that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have one coming down now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still in the hydro, in the grow
dance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we plan on bringing that back in the
soil as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the original OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Louis, the Fires, the Fire OG,
which comes from the Louis strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I crossed with some Land Race
Afghani to come up with my Formaggio
[SPEAKER_00]: Azzurro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we're going to smoke right after
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved myself for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're keeping a library of strains where
the industry right now is pivoting towards
[SPEAKER_02]: the za, the candy strains, which it is the
hype now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're growing a lemon cherry gelato as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is a popular strain now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a runs, but this one is a specific
lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always trading strains with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few we won't trade, but most
we're open to trading with most of our
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made a few exceptions with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given you a few of the genetics on
the limited list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the possibility of growing
from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some of our genetics are from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll come across the seed and then
we'll take clones from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the library of strains have been
accumulated throughout the years from
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, different clones from different
friends in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's interesting because you can
take the same strain from the same mom and
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it in different environments and it's
going to come out different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your environment does determine who you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the same for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your environment is who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a byproduct of your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting to see the same strain
from your friend or someone else that was
[SPEAKER_02]: grown and you've seen the end product and
then you see it grown in your facility and
[SPEAKER_02]: the end product is completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have two cultivation
facilities and we see a difference from
[SPEAKER_02]: facility to facility in the same strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see a difference from room to room with
the same strain.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the measurement of some ways the
rooms were laid out because of just the
[SPEAKER_02]: physical space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air flow and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a couple of feet of
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be the way to duck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the environment you created.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes a difference on how the plant
is grown or the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see the cannabis industry in
five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look out that far, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you like it to be and where do
you think it's going?
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry as a whole, it's got one
direction, you know, up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a lot of growth that is still
needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are an infant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as size and innovation,
there's still a lot to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we accelerated?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cultivation, extraction, manufacturing
of cannabis had a big infusion of capital
[SPEAKER_02]: and it accelerated very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely has a lot more to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as agriculture is expanding
and technology is and agriculture coming
[SPEAKER_02]: together and incredible things are
happening, the same is expected in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the business side of it,
there'll be more price compression to
[SPEAKER_02]: come.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you mean by price compression?
[SPEAKER_02]: The price of the cannabis is going to come
down, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The price per gram will be cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis will be commoditized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Infused products will absolutely,
the crude oil will be commoditized because
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol is alcohol, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have its lower end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have its higher end.
[SPEAKER_02]: The accordion stretch, as I call it,
is going to widen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a lot more products under $10
and more products over $60, $70,
[SPEAKER_02]: $80, $100, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have this big stretch
between a gap in pricing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be 80% of the market will be
under $10.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I promise you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there will be indoor under $10 as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking eighths for $10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's on our shelves now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have $8 eighths.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these outdoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouse, hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know there's great outdoor weed
that people undervalue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's undervalued.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that product's only going to get
better with more technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is the indoor boutique craft
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're seeing is if it's really
good, it's just going to go for more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there's branding and packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole lifestyle behind the
cannabis brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few brands are capitalizing on that
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Branding, marketing, that's a whole
another beast, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are experts in marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are experts in branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are people who brand
themselves incredibly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to continue to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to bring that value to
their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that be a majority of the product
sold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it's going to be about 5% of
the product sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably be 20% of the revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bulk of the product consumed in
the next five years will be under $10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what outdoor farms do you carry right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's get somebody else on the team to
kind of put that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I know some of the brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with some smaller farmers,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our cheap estates are smaller
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're brands not too many people know
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Family owned a few of the farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a brand, Tipsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Husband, wife, son, they package.
[SPEAKER_02]: They distribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have an affordable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love supporting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love them on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our customers love the $8.80.
[SPEAKER_02]: We carry a lot of the companies from the
Central Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mendocino, unfortunately,
the Northern California brands are
[SPEAKER_02]: struggling right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having a hard time coming to
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the distance has a little bit to
play with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a brand distributing out of
Mendocino or Humboldt, and there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: $3,000 order from a retailer in Los
Angeles, that drive down and the drive
[SPEAKER_02]: back up is a difficult one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking Santa Barbara,
San Luis Obispo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Barbara County is dominating the
greenhouse market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass house is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But outside of glass house, there's dozens
of other greenhouse and hoop house
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators that are providing an
affordable product to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some are doing very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Marijuana Business Journal,
I buy the report every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: My partner is like, you pay $120 for a
report.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yes, I pay $120 or $150 for this
report.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they break down a lot of the
economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they break down a lot of the
economics year by year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the 2022 report for the
previous year broke down all the brands
[SPEAKER_02]: and the market share they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And California had over 60 brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: The brands that had 50% of the market
share, that doesn't happen in most
[SPEAKER_02]: industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually the top 50, 60% is a handful of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 50, 60 companies that are doing
fairly well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there's 10,000 licensees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of guys that are not
doing that well, or they either have the
[SPEAKER_02]: license to cover up whatever else,
the diversion of what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is another big thing happening in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are good operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are run a good business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we try to work with those companies
that are on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do what they say they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show up on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that stuff matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand behind their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do the bait and switch on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of the few things we
look for when we're collaborating with or
[SPEAKER_02]: working with brands and putting them on
the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about federal
legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be in favor of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think it's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to happen with President
Biden?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's got a lot of other issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think deep down, he's not pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't I don't see him making that a
priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on who wins the next election,
if it's a Democrat or Republican,
[SPEAKER_02]: either way, I think we're doomed because
neither seem to have an appetite for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's high on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the more important decision is
going to be who's in the Senate and who's
[SPEAKER_02]: in control of the Senate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole 50 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think where we're at now, this lame duck
stuff is not going to push the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am for federal legalization,
which would mean that you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in New York or wherever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Californians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalization is is is is a positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of things that will
come with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there are some cons like large,
large corporations, players will come in
[SPEAKER_02]: and trying to dominate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will dominate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will they will dominate that 80
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, it will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll happen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but good businesses will come out of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And California will probably be the
biggest winner.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as cultivation goes and
brands go, California wine is some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: most highly prized wine in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: California cannabis will be some of the
most prized cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that play into the business plan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of some of the bigger cannabis companies
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's been a they actually
expose some of the bigger companies and
[SPEAKER_02]: how they've been trying to stop federal
legalization because it would affect a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of their investments in some of these
limited licensed markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have millions of dollars of
infrastructure would get rid of their
[SPEAKER_02]: monopolies or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if federal legalization happens,
I think interstate commerce is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole nother battle that I don't see
opening up for a long time if the big
[SPEAKER_02]: players have their way with the industry,
which they usually end up having their
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm for interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think California will benefit
tremendously from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the nation will as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of the product grown in
Colorado and Massachusetts and Connecticut
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of these states are horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, horrible product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw some good herb from Michigan
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the outside environment affects a
lot of the indoor environment as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now you have to go above and
beyond to control the indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have like 70 percent humidity
outside, you're going to have to get rid
[SPEAKER_02]: of it or you're going to have a problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our weather obviously pays to our favor
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some areas that cannabis will
just never grow again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will cannabis manufacturing happen in
California?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's going to happen where it happens.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Budweiser doesn't like transport beer
across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brew their own beer wherever they
need to brew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The raw bulk product will come from a
couple of states.
[SPEAKER_02]: California, Oregon has really big yields
in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have 15 pound trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida will have one nice harvest of high
yielding product once a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe a little product grown in
Florida, a little product grown in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of product grown in California as
far as outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be a bunch of indoor boutique
branded California lifestyle brands that
[SPEAKER_02]: will be sold across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely pro legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would support it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of benefits to the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the federal tax issue that the
industry deals with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the banking that the industry
deals with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pay thousands of dollars a month for
our banking compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no bank to deal with,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a bank, but it's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just one bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bank with the East West Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are cannabis friendly,
but they charge us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I don't even want to say what
they charge us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people's jaws will hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But didn't Walt Disney start his own bank
to get Disneyland built?
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that somewhere recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the cannabis industry should think
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are hurdles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are credit unions that people bank
with as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have to follow the coal memo,
which are the guidelines for banking and
[SPEAKER_02]: legal cannabis operations state by state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for banks, they have to go through a
lot of compliance when they bank with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your Bank of America, your Wells Fargo,
for a $50 a month account cannot verify
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're legal and compliant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our bank, they actually get our POS
reports and our metric reports every
[SPEAKER_02]: month.
[SPEAKER_02]: They audit our books every quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to pay people to audit us so
that when they get audited by the
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of I think it's Department of
Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or wherever the banking industry is
regulated by.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to make sure that we're
compliant so that they stay compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's thousands of dollars a month to
stay compliant with banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good luck on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Armin, thank you very much for
coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our fourth Cali High interview with LA
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to come out and see those bags
of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I brought some goodies here for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do some sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll let us know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Cali High episode
67.
