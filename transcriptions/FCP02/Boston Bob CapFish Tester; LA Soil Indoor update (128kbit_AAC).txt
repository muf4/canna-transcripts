[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on everybody real quickly
this is the catfish for me burning with
[SPEAKER_00]: bird I have seven of them and it's week
seven literally the end of week seven day
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 day 49 and this is the two this is the
one this is the five four six eight and
[SPEAKER_00]: the nine everything's starting to finish
up for real these are like the smallest is
[SPEAKER_00]: out here where there's not as much light
but it's still still throwing some nice
[SPEAKER_00]: version the number four the
[SPEAKER_00]: number four and the number five and the
number one are all the same pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: just being degrees in the nose and the
number six and the number eight are
[SPEAKER_00]: similar only the six smells similar to the
one and two and four and then the nine is
[SPEAKER_00]: just the standout that's part of the wrong
one and even in resin profile yeah this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire batch and as you can see mainly
shorter ones except for the two taller and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the midsize yeah that's all we got
going here nice maturity for week seven
[SPEAKER_00]: should be looking at a week nine finish
