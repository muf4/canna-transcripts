[SPEAKER_01]: Cali High, Cali High, yeah!
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Cali High, episode 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Cienzo Nico.
[SPEAKER_02]: This week our special guest is Ryan Cash,
aka Ryan Lattery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan is an amazingly original Jamaican
artist who is a self-proclaimed ganja man
[SPEAKER_02]: with several albums of material,
one of which, this 2019 release,
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke One, is a whole album of herb songs,
each in its own genre, from old school
[SPEAKER_02]: hip-hop to roots to dancehall to dubstep
and trap as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes from Waterhouse, a neighborhood
in Kingston, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: While his style is his own and he calls it
universal, we here at Cali High dubbed it
[SPEAKER_02]: Croaking Lizard Style.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about his early influences and his
childhood in Jamaica and explore his music
[SPEAKER_02]: in depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feature his video, Blowing Smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali High is blessed to be here with Ryan
Cash, aka Ryan Lattery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, how are you, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good, I'm good, I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, why don't you tell us a little bit
about yourself and where you're from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm from Jamaica, Kingston,
Jamaica, a community called Waterhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, who were you listening to when you
were growing up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was growing up, I used to listen to
a lot of people, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my mother told me that.
[SPEAKER_03]: She told me Get Up, Stand Up by Bob Marley
and the Wailers was my favorite song when
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: She told me that I used to have a dance
for it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the funny thing is she showed me the
dance when I was a younger man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I turned like 15,
that same dance became popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some new guy just randomly doing the
same stuff that I was doing as a...
[SPEAKER_03]: Stealing your moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without seeing me doing it though,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I listened to a lot of people,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But mostly the original foundation reggae
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bob Marley, the Peter Touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Burning Spear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the list goes on and on, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Toots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Toots, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Gregory Isaac, you know,
all those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the staples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before, you know, before long before my
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I becomes a little bit older
now, I listen to like later, later more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later artists like Budger Banton,
you know, Beanie Man, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: those guys, Bon Tequila, Sizzler,
you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sizzler's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those type of guys, you know, them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll eat more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll eat more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a lot of reggae guys,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you guys, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely Supercat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen to him too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I like his style a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supercat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Sean Paul and those guys,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Supercat, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supercat, you know, is a living legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to tell our listeners that
Ryan here has what I call a seminal album.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Smoke One.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a whole album with different
genres of herb songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each one of them can survive on its
own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but before we get into that,
I got a few other questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, some of those reminded,
you know, one of them reminded me of Peter
[SPEAKER_02]: Tosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I was telling you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really nailed those tunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be flying some of that in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long have you been writing music?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been writing music for like,
probably like 20 years now, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been writing music since I was a kid,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been doing music for like 23
years because I was in the marching band,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in my community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the St. Patrick marching band.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I used to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a parish in Kingston?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: The parish would be Kingston would be one
of the parishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 14 parishes in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica and Kingston would be one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the St. Patrick's now, it's a
Catholic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Catholic church at school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to be in the marching band,
you know, and in the marching band,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I used to play the side drum,
the bass drum until they transfer me to
[SPEAKER_03]: the trumpet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they put me on the trumpet,
I stayed on the trumpet for a few years
[SPEAKER_03]: until I left the drum corps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to play soccer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have a trumpet?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played the trumpet in so long,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm rusty right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we ever need a trumpet player,
we'll give you one and get you back up to
[SPEAKER_02]: speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to speed, for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who do you think your biggest
influences are?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we already mentioned Bob and
Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my biggest influence musically,
you know, that's of course, it's a tough
[SPEAKER_03]: question because I have so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, Bob and Peter before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I have some guys that the
world maybe not know of.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is called Zoom J.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he definitely inspire me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is he?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dancehall?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's Dancehall Reggae.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's now in the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually in the Army, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Army.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's on the reserve now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he served his time and now he's on
the reserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: A shout out to people in the military that
are musicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a reggae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an album deal when I was in the
Navy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I have so many, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Zoom J is one of them, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and Sean Paul, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who puts the songs together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the man behind the mask is me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it all together from the from the
sound of the beat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the last ad libs or the last vocal you
hear on the track.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have a unique style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything, the lyrics is all mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only lyrics that is not mine is
sometime whoever featured on my track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only sometime now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometime I actually wrote whoever
featured on the track part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like I would write it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would I would hear a female
voice singing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't do that because I don't hear my
voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear a female voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Snaps original?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is her name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Snaps official.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snaps official.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's on Smoke and Ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's on Ride and Smoke.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very cool name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard I heard a female rapper,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good thing was about that was when
I approached her about the song,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, she loved she liked it,
she liked the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what impressed me was she wrote her
own verse going in particular with what I
[SPEAKER_03]: was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, OK, this is going to make a
good collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a good collaboration.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to talk about your EP,
Save the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed a thematic approach to your
albums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one seems to address the youth of
Jamaica and the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, I would really love to talk about
that, you know, because the smoke one is
[SPEAKER_03]: big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one is your 2021 release.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's special to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's special to me because, like you said,
it's definitely talking to the youths of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say to the youths also of the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to target the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to say save the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody would look at me kind of
crazy, like, who is this guy coming to
[SPEAKER_03]: save the world?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this one guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the Caribbean first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hey, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good start.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I said, let's start with the
Caribbean, because for one, the crime and
[SPEAKER_03]: violence is plaguing the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yes, it's crazy in Jamaica,
but now it's starting to trot on to the
[SPEAKER_03]: others of islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: The crimes are crazy in Jamaica because I
watch the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever I go, I just watch the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of get a little bit of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I follow one of the ministers of
parliament there, Lisa Hanna.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa Hanna.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She used to be Miss, you know,
Miss Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was she?
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa Hanna was the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she still is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, she's still beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I was a kid, when I was younger,
she was the to me, she was the beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: girl in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Lisa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa Hanna.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were just talking about your 2021
release Save the Caribbean and how it's
[SPEAKER_02]: themed around the youth of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we mentioned Minister of Parliament
Lisa Hanna.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're talking about murder rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the murder rate per capital in Jamaica
is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the highest in the highest.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the world.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The highest in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it been like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It rank in the top, I must say,
the top 10 for the past 20 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: the past two decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not just in the top 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about in the top one,
two, three and then four or five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's been like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even going back to Bob Marley,
he tried the Smile Jamaica concert with
[SPEAKER_02]: who Manley and yeah, Michael Manley and
and Edward Seaga.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Edward Seaga.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tried to bring those those two
parties together so they lessen the
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting lessen them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the crime and the violence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was up to Bob to bring it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was up to the great man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three days after he got shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which was politics again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's all politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Politics, politics, and, you know,
but I I believe that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Marley saw the nonsense and him just
wanted wanted the people of the country,
[SPEAKER_03]: his country to just like live in love one
like why shoot each other, kill each other
[SPEAKER_03]: for what?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For nonsense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, he know that two people
that could get that to settle down was the
[SPEAKER_03]: two head of the two different parties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that's why, you know,
I believe that's why he went and did that
[SPEAKER_03]: show and the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up to Smile Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, Shelly and Foster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, Frazer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelly and Frazer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelly and Frazer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off of your also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The EP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Save the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it is a great song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hannerin, a great female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A great woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she is a track star in Jamaica,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a track and field athlete.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, world champion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica produces the fastest people in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely does.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and she also from my
neighborhood, Wathouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of so crazy to me that
this girl that becomes the Olympic
[SPEAKER_03]: champion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning all these medals came from a poor,
broken down, teared down community.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, talking about the bad we're
talking about now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, using dedication there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It have it, it have it goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to know that she try her best and work
so hard to make it not just make it out
[SPEAKER_03]: together, but to show a lot of females
around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the ghetto wherever you are in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you can do it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is, it don't have to be track
and field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a doctor, a lawyer,
whatever you choose as a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: But try hard and don't give up and you
will succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what she show the whole world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hussein Bolt to me is the greatest of all
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I don't see anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hussein Bolt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely the goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The greatest of all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, listening reggae music and
dancehall music, a lot of guys big up
[SPEAKER_03]: Hussein Bolt and nobody big up the female
track and field artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the track and field athletes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So listening to dancehall music now,
you know, and reggae music, a lot of a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of artists big up Hussein Bolt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, even us off of Powell too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I big them up in one of my songs before,
both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first song off of hybrids,
it's an album by Collie Buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also did a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He mentions Hussein Bolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's his collaborator or the
featured artist there, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hussein Bolt straight to the cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straight to the cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bolt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bolt to the cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every artist always doing the same thing,
them big up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when Shelly and now came and she
did all that good stuff that the world saw
[SPEAKER_03]: her did, I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody need to highlight this girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's one of the main
reasons why I did it, to highlight her,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, performance and her success and
all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, like I said, she's from my
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely had to do it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Waterhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Waterhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Waterhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Waterhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about your 2019 album,
Smoke One.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A seminal album.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I found it, I was more than
overjoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't stopped listening to it
since I found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole album is of weed songs,
and yet each one is of a different genre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the creative process of making
this album?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The creative process was, it was amazing
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing, you know, because like you
said before, it's different, different
[SPEAKER_03]: genre on it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, OK, I need to make a
cannabis album, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anybody has ever made a
cannabis album, have they?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they did, they only made one genre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is, it's one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got stuff that sounds like 90s hip
hop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a Snoop Dogg song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old Double G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dancehall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got like, you know, traditional roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just everything in between,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great songs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great songs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like you said, I got the
dance hall, I got the reggae, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: got dubstep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got hip hop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You forgot a cappella on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with the a cappella,
it was supposed to be a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that was the acoustic one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing a little bit of guitar on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing the acoustic on that one and
I was playing it, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just in the mood and I was just
going fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, your style is a minimalistic
feel to it in several instances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your vocals have slightly a dissonant
quality that is yet soothing and familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you call your style,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to call my style universal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were talking about your style,
Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it has a minimalistic feel to it
in many instances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your vocals have a certain dissonant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet soothing quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know anybody else that sings
kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought to myself, what is the name
of this style?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your own style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's definitely my own style.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and sometimes I just call it,
you know, I just say my style is
[SPEAKER_03]: universal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like whatever the universe,
you know, yeah, influence me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just do it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, what would I name it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd call it Croaking Lizard Style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Croaking Lizard Style.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Croaking Lizard Style.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to know what's my style,
it's Croaking Lizard Style.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Croaking Lizard Style.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't it be great if it stuck and then
we have other Croaking Lizard Artists
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up?
[SPEAKER_02]: It should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because music is universal to
me, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be, it should be music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you are definitely original though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As how it comes, that's how you should,
you should release it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It come this way, release it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be like, oh, I can't do this because
I'm this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do this because I'm that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the music come to you this way,
release it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the soul is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And art, you have to live in the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
We

We smoking weed in the air.

[SPEAKER_03]: I love this herbs in my hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Snoop and Wizzo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a weed man.

[SPEAKER_03]: Big up weed head American.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up weed head Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: And make you forget all the Caribbean.

[SPEAKER_03]: Make you forget the South American.
[SPEAKER_03]: We blowing smoke in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smoking weed in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: We blowing smoke in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoking weed in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just smoke me a ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to smoke me a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring the good shit anytime we in your

[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really need your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already got we own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch me mix four grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff it in a can when we smoke high
grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like a dog with a bone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm feeling nice homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause me up there like drone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we not stop smoking till we go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see me Amanda good crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shawty, cut the bullcrap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, come sit on my lap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then take a puff off the rude boy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla glue makes you don't have a clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The gush makes you stop hocking stush.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lamb spread she was dropping on me
bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know later Ron said that dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: We blowing smoke in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smoking weed in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: We blowing smoke in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smoking weed in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so for you young kids out there and
fellow artists, art is something that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to live in the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't stop or procrastinating too much
saying you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Live in the moment, live in the art and
that is art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't second guess yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were you thinking of when you
decided to make a whole album of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: songs?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking like man, I'm a weed
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like I'm a ganja man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana don't harm nobody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana is a plant and it's natural and
it helps you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of doctors prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So come on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more natural than a lot of these
behind the counter stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well it's a great idea and I don't think
anybody's ever done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's done it this well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So No Love off your 2019 release Green
Friday exudes disappointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about that disappointment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'll talk about that but what I would
like to say is that he did his homework on
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This man knows a lot of stuff and I like
it because you're all over my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all over my stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like to know who I'm interviewing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So No Love now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really and truly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No Love is like when I was younger and I
was not so much mature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much calm and have more understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be a little bit more wilder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excitable youth?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, like most youth nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Age brings wisdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can't blame the youths.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have to do is talk to the youths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to them so they can understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said don't do this or else this is
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe, just maybe they won't do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't get to the disappointment
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: No Love, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to let you off the hook on
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we were talking disappointment
and we're talking about your 2019 release
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so No Love now is definitely,
I'm trying to tell the youths them,
[SPEAKER_03]: literally say, there is no love out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking when I say out there,
I'm talking out there in the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So youths of today, there is no love out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No love out there in the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to join the gang or you want
to be affiliated with some guys that you
[SPEAKER_03]: think is cool because you see them on the
corner, hanging out, doing whatever and
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking that these guys got love for you
because they say you are their little man
[SPEAKER_03]: or their juvenile.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're just playing you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't no love out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't no love out here in these streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a lot of disappointment
you're going to face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so there is no love out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: No love out there in the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: No love at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you might think there is,
but it's fake love.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for the young kids out there,
anyone that's older than you, trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: influence you to do wrong and you know
it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't no love out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and ain't no love out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even certain things, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one that's kind of
exacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain the risk we take in Miss
My Flight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that one, that's a good one because I
didn't even see this one coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so now Miss My Flight is the
it's a nice one because actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest with you though,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Lesion Beats, you know, they're a big,
nice production company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make beats, sell beats, doing all
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do the whole works, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they're in San Fran,
yeah, the Bay Area, San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I think Gabe from Lesion
Beats sent me three beats that he wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: me to see what I could do on them,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're back here with Ryan Cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're explaining the risk we take in
Miss My Flight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the risk we take now, explaining the
risk we take is, you know, all type of
[SPEAKER_03]: risk we take, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take all type of risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, you know, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little temptation there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes gotta go out on a limb,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all the time, but every now and then,
you know, if it is right, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not influencing nothing,
I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely now, to that particular
song now, like I said, Gabe from Lesion
[SPEAKER_03]: Beats sent me those beats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that particular track came with a
hook, with a chorus on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chorus was sung by Vidal Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also made beats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Featured on song.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also made beats, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he'd sing that hook, and he'd sing
that chorus so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I heard it, he the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as I heard him sing, I gotta leave
early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wish I could stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I heard it, I was just like,
I already know what to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the beat dropped and the
blank space came in, I just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what you done did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Messing with you, shawty, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, I think, something that you was
intending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think him and Gabe, both of them know
what they was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I heard it, I just did that
thing, and it came out good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got it mixed and mastered,
and I sent it back to one of the guys at
[SPEAKER_03]: Lesion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it was Gabe, but I sent it
back to them, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then asked them how they feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they was like, yo, they like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I was like, all right,
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I just go ahead and just put it
out on the EP, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a great song.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Green Friday EP.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Break Her Heart reminds me of a Beatles
song.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also off the same EP, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the same EP, Green Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also has a Roots feel in some
parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question was, who's playing on
that song?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess it's you, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and one of my good musician friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's definitely not just a
recorded beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's live instruments on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's my good old buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Name is Kyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anybody ever mention that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle Pillum.
[SPEAKER_02]: In comparison to that song?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does remind me of a Beatles
song, the actual changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people like that song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that song is my favorite song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that song is for my daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: How cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was singing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Amanda Amoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Amanda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Amanda Amoy, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that song is about my daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's my favorite song and my most
touching song to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a lot of touching songs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, because I'm saying that I'm the
first one to ever break her heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I'm the first man to ever break my
own daughter heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope she got over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: She got over it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she's growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a teenager now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, you know, she's she's
maturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she been love her daddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she always love her daddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: She she never once didn't like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She always loved me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just feel as a parent and as a man
and as a father that I I felt that I break
[SPEAKER_03]: her heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wrote a song saying that sorry to
break your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about your personal style.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personal style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Croaking lizard style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Croaking lizard guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Croaking lizard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Croaking lizard.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ride and smoke featuring snaps
official is very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked a little bit about that
collab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long did it take you to write that
whole album, by the way?
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole album.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about smoke one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, smoke one.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it didn't take me long because the
reason why it didn't take me long is I had
[SPEAKER_03]: one song already written.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I only had nine more to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I already already had a head start,
you know, and then the the roughest part
[SPEAKER_03]: was putting the production part together,
getting all the the sounds, the beats,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the, you know, this beat, that beat,
this one got the sound like the dubstep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, which my my my my boy again,
Kyle, put that one together for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle Gillum.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Kyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of shouting out, I was just going
to ask you, who would you like to shout
[SPEAKER_02]: out to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I'm shouting out someone,
definitely you don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to shout out my mother first,
you know, because my mother, she showed me
[SPEAKER_03]: and gave me endless love, you know,
and she taught me how to be a great man,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and all the bad things that I
have done.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that is on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of that is on my mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, she taught me how to be a
great man and a good, good person.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ivan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ivan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody call her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people call her mom or them call her
mama, Ivan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's my mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely you don't know how to thank
the creator of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give thanks for life, health and strength,
guidance and protection all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, definitely want to shout out my
