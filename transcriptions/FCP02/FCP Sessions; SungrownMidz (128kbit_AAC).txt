[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're sitting in the aftermath of
Masonic's Free Seed Day, the third annual.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Masonic for bringing the
community together and then shout out FCP
[SPEAKER_03]: for giving us a place to be the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first ever Sunday sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now Grove Bags is in the building,
which is super exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Trevor, his ungrown mids here,
and I don't know, I couldn't be happier to
[SPEAKER_03]: be spending my Sunday this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out Mace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really appreciate the space and
the reason to come down here to LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Peter, for also holding it
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: This space, endless noise is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you contribute to the Bags or Free
Seed Day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I dropped the Gary Payton TKM10.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you got a Gary Payton bag,
it's a Gary Payton.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice Gary Payton, you know,
gassy, squat, gany type style with that
[SPEAKER_04]: TKM10 hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Payton personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, again, it's just like
neutral smoke and weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has good, easy flavor to enjoy
throughout the whole joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely as a smoke, you know,
flower, it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some friends who washed some and it
wasn't producing yields on the wash,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it definitely, it's a nice smoker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and the color, all that, you know,
it's a cookies cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's checks and boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for those who aren't aware of what
Free Seed Day is, it's basically an event
[SPEAKER_05]: thrown by Edgar, aka Masonic Smoker,
at his store on Fairfax.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was from 10 to 3 yesterday,
but the line started on Wednesday and the
[SPEAKER_05]: event was on a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically you can pull up and a bunch
of people chip in their seeds and what
[SPEAKER_05]: they want to give out in terms of gear and
you can come and collect a bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Trevor is one of those people who had
a table there and was giving out gear as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And did you see anything super interesting
there in terms of gear, stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I saw stuff coming in from Ukiah,
stuff coming in from other states and some
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD, some autos.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just wanted to see if anything caught
your interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was lots of gear there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, so this time it was interesting to
see some of the people who showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there was some old school cats who
are like, you know, LA legends to a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain extent at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA was there, Crockett was there,
and it was cool to see those guys at Seed
[SPEAKER_04]: Day because I've been to every Free Seed
Day since the first one when Masonic first
[SPEAKER_04]: did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, this time it was,
it's been super efficient in the past
[SPEAKER_04]: where it was like, you know, the bags were
pre-made, people stood in line,
[SPEAKER_04]: they came in, they got their bags,
they were able to get some shirts and
[SPEAKER_04]: different stuff, but like it was quick
fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: This time people got to come in,
there was tables out, they got to select
[SPEAKER_04]: different stuff that they wanted to
select, they got to add and kind of build
[SPEAKER_04]: your own bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like that was super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it was legit in terms of seeing
how many people were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was Bloom, there was big
names, people, Oni was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What he was handing out, absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got one of those Oni packs,
like that's special.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, just, I bumped into people who
had gotten my stuff at previous Free Seed
[SPEAKER_04]: Days and talked about the different gear
that they had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, I made all these pina
hash plant crosses with my buddy
[SPEAKER_04]: Landhammer Farms and those crosses,
have made some great concentrates and some
[SPEAKER_04]: great flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people have those pina hash plant
seeds and they can go and make their own
[SPEAKER_04]: and breed with that and make their own
little thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, that's
something that's really awesome about Free
[SPEAKER_04]: Seed Day is that people are getting like,
they're not just getting random ass packs,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're actually getting breeding
gear, you're getting stuff that you could
[SPEAKER_04]: start a company with if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and so we got something different
last year, not the pina gear, but some Sky
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuddler from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it just happened to be in the
pre-made bag that we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of our favorite things that
we ran.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was, I guess, what you were
giving out last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: This year was the pina.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the TK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you working on, like in the near
future and sort of in looking towards next
[SPEAKER_03]: year?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think next year people are either going
to get like gold star crosses from,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin Jodry hooked me up with some gold
star F5s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got really, I'll be honest,
somewhat depressing germination rates on
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got like eight out of 72 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But out of those eight, I'm going to keep
them all, keep all the males.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll do as much of an increase as we
can with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then otherwise I'm also selecting
males from an Afro Pips Malawi Gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so expect Malawi crosses next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time we linked up a couple of months
ago, I had some of your Malawi Chem and
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the Malawi Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those two were some of my favorite
smokes in the last few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they were just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time of the day smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need those Malawi crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing out some more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a bunch of the Malawi Chem
started.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually kicking myself because I had
a bunch, it's old seed stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't particularly good looking seed
stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like a lot of white seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I just popped my seeds this
year, I put a bunch of like three,
[SPEAKER_04]: four, you know, seeds in a cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every one of them popped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just, there's two to three
times more than I expected to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've got a bunch of seedlings that
I'm going to bring down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we may do a little thing in the coming,
you know, next month or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come down, have little starts and
some forages for people and just hand
[SPEAKER_04]: those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, yeah, the Malawi Chem and
probably just some pure Malawi from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bodhi increase of African Seed Co's
Malawi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been able to smoke some of your
guys's Sky Cuddler and absolutely on
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You crushed it with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't wait to grow more Sky Cuddler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the Sky Cuddler from the man's
sun-grown midst himself, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one of our favorites from our
garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd be remiss to not shout out Mean
Gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mean Gene, the originator of the Sky
Cuddler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bollywood Bam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who did the pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was there at Possible and he popped
like a thousand beans and he kicked us,
[SPEAKER_04]: Landhammer, all of the males and all,
not all, but like four or five select
[SPEAKER_04]: females.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where that F4 increase was
made, was off of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And shout out the work he's doing in Santa
Cruz County to help bring justice to the
[SPEAKER_05]: situation going on with farmers out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: April 27th, he's got a hearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in Santa Cruz, anywhere in
Northern California, honestly,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can try and get to Bam's hearing
because the more people that show out,
[SPEAKER_04]: the better for him and for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to come on with the lawyer he's
working with to start talking because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to apprentice with that lawyer,
which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know you can get a law degree
without going to law school.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other path.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like a civil rights defense
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's an important case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's already gotten big wins in terms
of getting his seized possessions back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping for some more wins on the
horizon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was that Sky Cuddler increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a whole bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Sky Cuddler F4s that got
made.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also some Gnome Magic that you
guys got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited about those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Gnome Magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you said that was Masonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's from Mace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our good friend Masonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so fucking excited to grow that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've ever grown from Masonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our last garden, we had his Chiclets
and his Banana God Z3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Banana God Z3 was the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that Banana God Z3 is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch of clones going from that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the... Out of the garden,
our favorites were probably Banana God Z3,
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiclets, and Sky Cuddler Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which were all things I think we got at
Free Seed Day last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it all comes full circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, you said something that really
struck me, and I wonder if you'd elaborate
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just sort of spoke about how you
viewed partially what Masonic was
[SPEAKER_03]: building, but also sort of what was
happening in like urban centers and how
[SPEAKER_03]: they've become equally sort of centers of
influence around stuff, genetic stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as what's going on on the hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was curious if you have thoughts
on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely think that what Mace has
built there at his shop is a cultural hub
[SPEAKER_04]: where people can come every weekend he's
open.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got an opportunity and you're in
the LA area, just to experience it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you should come down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're not a grower or a breeder,
it's definitely worth coming and
[SPEAKER_04]: experiencing what he's building there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is is that there's been
epicenters for years in terms of up north,
[SPEAKER_04]: up in the hills, in Mendo, in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a kid, a lot of us started out,
we'd go up there and we'd trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we'd trim, we'd get seeds,
we'd bring them back to wherever we were,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we'd start growing out those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of got us on our foundation
and leveled us up in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's particularly not accessible anymore
because the whole trim scene's gone and
[SPEAKER_04]: dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really... I'm probably one of
the last contemporary kids to get in on a
[SPEAKER_02]: big grow and become the grower there from
trimming in the last four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strange that it happened to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I ran my first big spot, that was by
proxy of literally just getting a trim job
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You work your way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eventually need somebody to cover and
then boom, you're fucking running a 50
[SPEAKER_02]: lighter all of a sudden and you've only
grown in your backyard and in a garage
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't happen anymore as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trimming's a great way to learn about the
plant because you really get to learn the
[SPEAKER_04]: structure and details of individual plants
and the variations and differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the better you get at trimming,
the more you get to understand the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: on a morphological basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those first early years,
that was a lot of people's introduction
[SPEAKER_04]: and access to good genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clubs came along eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bay Area clubs were an epicenter.
[SPEAKER_04]: LA absolutely popped off.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, that whole dynamic and
everything about that has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really so much of a community.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not so much of a trading
underground thing unless you're on the
[SPEAKER_04]: internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the internet's cool, but it's
amorphous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what Mace has done is he's given a
brick-and-mortar location for this type of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing to get together and giving people in
urban centers like LA who had no access
[SPEAKER_04]: and no way going up into the fucking hills
of Mendo and Humboldt or wherever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They now can just go down to Fairfax of
all places and get in on that and
[SPEAKER_04]: experience it in a way that gives them
access to this community, to these
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics, these resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, I've met so many people there
who have just become regulars at the shop
[SPEAKER_04]: and learned so much and leveled their
games up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got flower this year and I've seen these
people's flower for the last three years
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's gotten consistently better and
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's something that we've got a
new sort of cultural hub and a new way for
[SPEAKER_04]: the culture to expand and articulate and
express itself that I think is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that is the best way to
describe what Masonic Sound and Fairfax
[SPEAKER_05]: really is and all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even from a Southern California
perspective, there really was no place
[SPEAKER_05]: before that you could connect.
[SPEAKER_05]: LA is a city of 10 million people and most
people tend to stay in their little
[SPEAKER_05]: neighborhood or city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it kind of gave people down here as
well a place to connect with others and
[SPEAKER_05]: build camaraderie and just grow on that
aspect like they do on the hill where
[SPEAKER_05]: people are more so a tight-knit community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like LA is venturing towards
that and Masonics is definitely the focal
[SPEAKER_05]: point of where all that is originating
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who shows interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know who you're going to see
there and on top of that, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: matter if you're affiliated with cannabis
or not, he's happy to answer any questions
[SPEAKER_05]: about what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people walk in with no idea
what's going on and he'll just sit them
[SPEAKER_05]: down and educate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a Masonic smoker?
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit is so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or some people will walk out after having
taken a giant dab, maybe never having
[SPEAKER_02]: taken a dab in their life, but just are
cannabis enthusiasts that happen to
[SPEAKER_02]: stumble in because they think it's a shirt
store or something or just are curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vibe is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the locals there, Mace gets a lot of
love and the people who are kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: have it's Masonic no context, they just
walk in, they've got no idea and they see
[SPEAKER_04]: these shirts, they see a bunch of people
around a table and it's a retail
[SPEAKER_04]: experience they've never seen and they're
like, what's this about?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a possibility for a lot of culture
clash and potentially bad outcomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mace handles it and interacts with people
who don't have any idea about what's going
[SPEAKER_04]: on in a way that just brings them into the
set and the community and people right
[SPEAKER_04]: there in that shopping center went from
being like, what the fuck is this to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that all stems from how open
Mace is and approachable as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we said, anyone can walk into the
shop and he'll still be the first person
[SPEAKER_05]: to greet them, ask them how their day is,
ask them what's up and tell them all about
[SPEAKER_05]: the store and what he's about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really think that's something that
stands for more than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something to stay for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's, it's legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, if you, anybody who hasn't
been there, go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's legit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a shout out to Free Seed Day,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unbeatable experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also walk us through the seeds you
brought here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm the worst at this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I should have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Sky Cuddler Kush F4s, gonna go back
through these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So got a fat sack of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, we got the Biscotti Sky Cuddler
Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the No Magic Sky Cuddler Kush
and the Gushers Sky Cuddler Kush just to
[SPEAKER_04]: go through a range of Sky Cuddlers for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is, I'm excited about these.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the, Chem D TKM10.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what, if you got Free Seeds,
same males here as in the Gary Payton.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gisle TKM10, Josh D TKM10 and Lem OG
TKM10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like all gas there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be good hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue to be the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, what was really, there was a
lot of stuff at Free Seed Day this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know Hydru, High Definition
Genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: He dropped the, just a mystery pack where
he mixed everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grabbed that mystery pack of Wilson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, so that mystery pack's got some
incredible shit in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got Banana God, you got all kinds of
different things that are in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's a random pack with all his
different things where it's just seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: that got mixed together where he's like,
he can't say what it is, but he knows that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's from his list of females that he made
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I smoked some of that Wilson F3
crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Phenotest, the strawberry fiddle
crosses were amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those I'd look out for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I mean, all sorts of people,
Exotic Mike sent in seeds, Bloom,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I said, sent in seeds, some I-95
crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be some shit in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you guys said, Oh no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Flying Lion Research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some highly experimental ones
that are, could, like you said,
[SPEAKER_05]: someone could find a business on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to hit the Landhammer?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we should shout out Landhammer
a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Landhammer Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew a bunch of Oni seeds this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in those Oni seeds, there was the
Zahidi Lime, the Kempti Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so dude won first place, like his
flower or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got washed to make the first place entry
at the Emerald Cup a few years back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hands down, we all agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is far and away better than the
Emerald Cup winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So also Uplifted Meds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny, check him out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uplifted Meds is the homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind switching the camera,
showing off the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: He definitely has been making some killer,
killer fucking melons.
[SPEAKER_03]: The logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is such a blessing to get to win this
jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otis, after jazz, I want to go in for one
of these too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, it's Zahidi Lime, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Lime Z, like it's just,
it's, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, the Kempti Haze has got some
really limey haze turps that like super
[SPEAKER_04]: potent will last and last and last for
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, the Sour Haze, you were saying
was your favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just is so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we had an experience with some
people yesterday where I took a dab of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they walked in the room and they
were like, why does the room smell so
[SPEAKER_03]: good?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, it's one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that about hazes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The proper haze should change the aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: The aroma of the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, this is the Sherb Nana from Terp
Stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then did you see any hash
yesterday that you thought was
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like elsewhere outside of the landhammer
stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so before hash, I saw some flowers
that were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some midnight mass flowers that
I saw that were just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, of course Oni had some great,
some great flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some Piff and, um, yeah,
then, um, I suck with people's,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, IG handles, but, uh, got hash homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always got the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some of his full milk here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of the first people that we
did, um, we smoked a lot of this
[SPEAKER_03]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were like, you know, we weren't even in
the circle where he was at.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were standing off to the side and we
just both looked up and we're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: damn, what's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like when you're standing outside,
five to 10 feet away from somebody,
[SPEAKER_04]: not even like in the circle where he's
handing the show people and you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're smelling the Terps across the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you know, it just hit us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otis, how was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Zahidi lime is such a delicious cross
of a lime flavor and a Skittles flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tahiti lime is super, super like,
it's like really round citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to put like a pinpoint on
exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has like slight bitter notes of
like kumquat almost and like loquat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, of course the Z is
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, brings grapefruit notes, candy notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very, very euphoric off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious sun grown resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that's what more can I say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, the seeds that you had an ego
clash, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the pineapple butt melon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, I mean, that's one that
everyone can look forward to soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what's good with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just so the pineapple butt melon
is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow it for flower and you have the
flowers, it's going to be really Donnie
[SPEAKER_04]: burger GMO forward really like you smell
it and you're like, this is a GMO cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take it and wash it, the GMO and
the Donnie burger all moves to the back
[SPEAKER_04]: and all you get on the, the resin is
pineapple forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, damn, this is super
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then on that back end, you'll taste
that Donnie burger sort of funk,
[SPEAKER_04]: the butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the, the pineapple butt melon is just
gnarly as can be on the garlic funky turp
[SPEAKER_04]: and the flower sweet and pineapply as can
be on the on the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, everybody we've handed it
out to has gotten great germination rates,
[SPEAKER_04]: super vigorous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, uh, everybody who's tried the
concentrates has been like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the shits fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that again, shout out Landhammer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Landhammer grew all those popped them
straight from seed in July, like direct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and, uh, grew out a bunch of the
Donnie burger, a bunch of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Oreos and other pina crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, the pineapple turps are really
interesting and cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, they're, they're unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's nice when that stuff kind of
comes through in the, uh, in the
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate and you really, really get
like true to form where you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, this is pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it's making a resurgence.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least, uh, I was at a female hunt last
week where, uh, pineapple and turpinoline
[SPEAKER_05]: and Jack flavors were the highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I got rung out after about eight
or nine of those duties, but it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: something that you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you can forward the taste all the way
through, it is something that's very
[SPEAKER_05]: present and very, uh, straightforward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, uh, those turps on that lifesaver
are really unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean like and it's just,
it's like we were saying, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you just don't get that in most
concentrate because you know, the yields
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't there necessarily, but like,
it's not production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not production hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a flavor hunting hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also it's headstache.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's worth it on that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you get to experience it,
it's, it's only like whatever you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not nearly full.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 grams total from six pounds of fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, at those, yeah,
it's legit to see that sort of,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, and to be able to experience it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's like, it's a one and done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that's really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate that, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's fun to be able to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's really fun resin to be able
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fucking zahidi lime got me so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone who doubts the power of candy
and fruit turps, uh, do not doubt any
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your hands on some zahidi lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And be on the lookout for uplifted meds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, uh, he washed all that great washing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, I know he's at a couple of events
coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to be up in Oregon,
uh, in the coming weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think he's in sack, uh, this
weekend, but, um, uplifted meds is
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely somebody, if you're into,
uh, festival wear, if you're into,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, good, good rosin, he's your,
he's your plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude's got it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes really cool outfits, hats,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Him and his, uh, girlfriends and,
um, they make great melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the note of interesting hash that I did
see yesterday, shout out to some dude
[SPEAKER_05]: named compost Malone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know your real name, but I know
your Instagram tag.
[SPEAKER_05]: That scorange was really, really
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, a unique kind of sour citrus
tangy turp that I hadn't smelled in a
[SPEAKER_05]: while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, shout to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, um, also, uh, Tapatio melts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, it's, it's cool that we see
homies from out of state and out of
[SPEAKER_05]: California come to precede day and rep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it really is an event that brings
people in from all over and you really get
[SPEAKER_05]: to see and share memories and hash and,
and smoke with some people, some people,
[SPEAKER_05]: good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Homies doing work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the Tapatio melts is like dope
branding and also just really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really high quality material that's
getting produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he said, out of state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing to see that, you know,
the hashtag isn't really being gate kept
[SPEAKER_03]: and people are doing incredible work
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there is really good material
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and hash really allows a lot of
sunburn material to shine, I think in a
[SPEAKER_03]: cool way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should probably bounce out at this
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sun grown resin, legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, uh, yeah, we can wrap it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hang out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
