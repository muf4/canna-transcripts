[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, FCP community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobster Fam Farms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to show you my process of
how I run through a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start, I like to soak seeds for about
18 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use hydrogen peroxide or any
number of mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a drop of humic and a few drops of
some mellow enzyme into filtered water.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH to about 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: A paper towel soak will work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be cautious that your paper towel
doesn't dry out and ruin your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also put your seeds right into a
cube or right into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most techniques work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your seeds have sprouted,
it's time to carefully get them into your
[SPEAKER_00]: media, whatever media you're going to be
running for the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a good opportunity to start
labeling your seeds so you can keep track
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I like to wait about 6 to 8 weeks
before taking cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the hormones are really set.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my approach, I like to take two of each
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, keeping the labeling is
very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you correlate your
cuttings with your mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take one of each plant and put them
into the veg room to have genetic backups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll take one of each of them and put
them into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put them in my room that's
almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, just in case there is any rogue
pollen, that it's not really going to harm
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've put my cuttings into the
flower room, I should see results in about
[SPEAKER_00]: 7 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see from these pictures how
clearly and concisely I can tell that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a male plant as opposed to the mother
plant that's just showing minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, I should have enough
data to know if I'm going to want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the cuttings first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, on a 10 pack of seeds,
I'd say it takes me probably about 30
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to find one that I actually keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not a huge likelihood that
they'll be a super winner, for me at
[SPEAKER_00]: least, for my criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are interesting from Nerds
Genetics because they were bred for a
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless production, which I think is
very interesting because it's kind of new
[SPEAKER_00]: and it still seems like a crapshoe,
even if people are really breeding in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still seems like a low likelihood that
you'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only am I going to be monitoring
them for, as I would, harvesting flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing for flower, it's also going
to have to be the next step once it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: hit in the resin dial and gets tested to
see if it actually washes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a new style of testing
for me, but I'm very excited to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many ways to run through seed
packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find mine is very different as where I
don't expect any real production of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant that came from the actual
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I like to not devote too much
room to unknown genetics, so I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: flower the Dixie Cups, as I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually I'll give the seed plant,
once I've identified them as females,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually I'll just give it away to someone
else or as a gift or just throw them
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, the real value in the future is
having the genetics and having it in clone
[SPEAKER_00]: form and getting data from the clone form,
since that's going to be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since these were testing strains,
I wouldn't feel right giving them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to bring them up to an
outdoor location and that will help nerds
[SPEAKER_00]: get more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only can we see how they do inside
this year, we can also see how they react
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be a little bit skewed because
they're plants from seed, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll appreciate the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple interesting side notes as I've
been running through these Nerds Genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Straw Nana Papaya Dr. Hoffman
Cross, out of the nine plants that made it
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the 12 to this point, only one
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have eight females to run through,
which is a blessing and a curse because I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very good chance of finding
something special, but I also have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more data to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another interesting side note was that
even though I was very accurate with my
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling, I labeled the two genetics very
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ones that I had labeled WZ were
actually the Straw Nana Papaya and vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mistakes happen and it's all a process,
but now that I've identified it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to reverse them and I still
have everything correlated accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I see anything interesting,
I'll be able to keep it for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just thought it was interesting that
it's always a process and I had been
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, I had been finding it curious
that everyone else's WZs were the tall
[SPEAKER_00]: ones and the fast growers and mine were
the only ones that were the SPs that were
[SPEAKER_00]: faster growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't anything besides my mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed the process of how
I run through seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the nerds genetics start showing more
character and flower, I'll be sure to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to share with everyone and whoever's
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in tune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobster Fam Farms out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to you, Future Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
