[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like this is a good time to
highlight some of the irrigation system
[SPEAKER_02]: going on, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was another part I want to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this all in house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all our design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is and we'll walk up there and
I'll show you, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have there's there's over 100 year
old hand dug ditches that bring the water
[SPEAKER_00]: from the river across the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was set up to be flood
irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's these little sort of outlets
where the water you just put a tarp down
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how these fields were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since mostly for cattle and for grass
or hay, you know, that'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the problem has been is that
these things are over 100 years old and
[SPEAKER_00]: hand dug, they leak like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water being such a precious resource
out here, you got to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be able to protect it and
contain it and bring it where you want it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be and not waste it along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're the only farm on this river
system right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here that have piped their ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way we've removed that leakage
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we put is a bulge pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you guys up here in a minute
that brings our water from through the
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe ditches, not wasting a drop,
puts it in the bulge pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our irrigation system comes out
from the bottom of it with a main line
[SPEAKER_00]: heading to two brewer tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put in underground main line
and then headers that go up into each one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can literally flip a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water the whole garden at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeremy, how much of what you guys do
at Cannabis Conservancy focuses on the
[SPEAKER_02]: water conservation?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water, energy, waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a metric to help help the farmer
reduce it, not only recognize it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also reduce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Casey is one of our flagships on an earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Cannabis Conservancy is part of that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only regenerative, but sustainable
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's really, really our focus
is to helping the farmer recognize their
[SPEAKER_01]: practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeing where they could better save
water, save, you know, reduce waste,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're kind of like handing the farmer
a magnifying glass and saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, take a closer look at this component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look at this component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look at this component and
elevate it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the analogy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great concept to improve the growth
of medicine that's improving the lives of
[SPEAKER_02]: so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another farm favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Funfetti cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made that one, Casey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this one is the Farmfetti Cake
Crasher by Cookies and Cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tricom stacking on that is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great nose too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doughy, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the Cookies and Cream coming out
of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that SSV structure.
I'll be taking some home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the way it knots out like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this one definitely a lot of people,
a lot of people in the dispensary has been
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yes, bring more Funfetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was just recently planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these houses now is going to
get, is in the process of getting sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a depth makeover where we'll force flower
on these houses in third week of July,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20th, around the 20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: A problem that we've had at this
particular site, it's a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at the bottom of a hill there,
right on this flat, right on the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the bottom of a hill on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this natural cold sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last three years we've been
hammered by cold weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, on October 25th of 2020,
it was 16 degrees in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is like colder than anywhere else in
the valley, in the greater valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this was, this was insanely cold
and we had a tremendous amount of loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel like if we can depth these out,
being that we have the infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get in before the frost even has
chance to mess us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head start, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump that what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three to four weeks on the natural
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that you can kind of see in
the, you know, fresh planting a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've added some earthworm castings on
top, but underneath is just the native
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were saying it's just a native
soil, but it's so much more given the
[SPEAKER_02]: years of sheet mulching and like bringing
it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, this is the essence of
regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take semi-dead soil from years and
years of solar abuse and whatnot and soil
[SPEAKER_02]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overgrazing over ag practices that
didn't necessarily jive with a
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative format, you know,
of just heavy watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular piece of property was one
of the original homesteads in this little
[SPEAKER_00]: Applegate Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hadn't been farmed in 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got it, there was just a
tremendous amount of grass kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: overgrown and maybe even a little bit of
marshiness from sort of the leaky ditches
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just sort of set to work on it,
laying down mulch and getting it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every year we get more
productivity out of the plants and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
