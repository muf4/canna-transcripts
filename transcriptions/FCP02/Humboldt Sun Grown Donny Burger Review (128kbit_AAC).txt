[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Nothing For Sale, the review
show by Custy's for Custy's.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: as my oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Pax to the Future off to the side
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're here to review some
outdoor Donnie burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into that, I just want to
talk a little bit about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a glass blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, you know, work in media,
worked on documentaries, worked on live
[SPEAKER_00]: visuals and also now I'm going to be
working with Peter at Future Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Project to help produce some content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pax, why don't you tell us a little
bit about yourself as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm really an enthusiast learning
about growing now, but not as accomplished
[SPEAKER_01]: as you or so many of the amazing people on
this channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started out as a fan, watching Peter,
watching everyone that he brought on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really marvelous content and we're
just super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do strain reviews and, you know,
I'm super excited to be here doing strain
[SPEAKER_01]: reviews with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, big shout out to Future
Cannabis Project and Peter for having us
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're stoked for many more reviews in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So particularly excited about this Donnie
burger, which is Han Solo Burger X GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Han Solo burger is GMO X Lario G.
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO, you know, Chem X cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a ton of GMO Chem Terps, I think,
in this, obviously, Chem and Lario G too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the rubber glove squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to, I like to describe the like
super like acrid, like almost kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, some people might call it a fuelier
Chem Terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call it that like rubber glove
or latex glove Terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like pungent and like it hits
your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's, it's really acrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly associate that with a lot of
cannabis that gets me really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically the GMOs, because you've got
what, like four different instances of GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up in this like genetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of Chem and GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of Chem and GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, what's really exciting is this is
an outdoor grow and there's a lot of buzz
[SPEAKER_01]: going on right now around the chart that
was developed by the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_01]: indicating that, you know, you see
significantly higher terpian percentages
[SPEAKER_01]: in outdoor flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you were saying, this has that
acrid tennis ball, but also really meaty,
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of bacon grease and also not
dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know why it'd be awesome
if someone could tell us in the comments
[SPEAKER_01]: where the burger came from and Han Solo
burger, but there's a meaty quality for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you're frying bacon and it
just fills the kitchen for hours and fills
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose and you can't get rid of the
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the way I described that
some might not think of as very pleasant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with this, with this Donnie burger,
it's quite pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a real movement back
towards Chem Terp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of discussion around candy
and the candy way of being over and people
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to go back to gas and OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for a lot of purists,
that's Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just cracked this right now and we'll
both take a sniff of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right now is just like, it honestly,
like it, it honestly kind of smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: oatmeal, like a fresh thing of oats,
like the funk of the grains and like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know some people might think that's
a bland description, but I think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very like significant funk description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like almost like, you know,
to get into the kind of wine descriptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a, like a barn floor hay kind
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There totally is a grassy quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also got a buttered popcorn when I was
smelling it last.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that chem dude, that fucking,
that glove smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I'll hand off this nugget I just
cracked for you to smell and invigorate
[SPEAKER_00]: your senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know where this was grown,
but it was clearly grown under beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: In really rich, healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flower indicates, you know,
a very happy growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really a lot of the textural qualities
that you would see in outdoor are
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigated by just how overwhelmingly
sticky this is to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that while it's not incredibly
frosty, it has great trichome definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was clearly, you know, living in an
environment where it wanted to produce all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those natural defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this one was possibly done in Northern
California, which as many people know is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best, um, best terroirs in
California for growing outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, possibly Mendocino, possibly Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but looking at this, it's just,
it looks like a really happy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it was a very happy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just on the way this is growing
the, you know, the, the little leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: the calyxes are pointing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the whole thing was praying its whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That something's good and it's swollen and
greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, we're going to roll this
one up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've smoked this one already and it
got us incredibly high, but ultimately the
[SPEAKER_00]: best test is going to be smoking it on
camera and describing the experience as it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we, we really enjoy this Donnie
burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a strong one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just similar to the GMOs and the
chems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, wait till I'm done clacking this to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a narcotic profile to the
terpians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even when you're smelling it in
the room, there's something woozy and
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will absolutely do the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to light this joint up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this is the Donnie burger
outdoor unknown grower given to us by
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter from future cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited about these terps GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, and Z are the two strains
right now where I don't mind that someone
[SPEAKER_01]: is just in breeding it to itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you know, double up on some of
those amazing qualities of those strains
[SPEAKER_01]: and take it in different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think there's, there's a distinct
meatiness to this that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the bat, the flavor is really
chemi, GMO-y, uh, definitely like full
[SPEAKER_00]: bodied smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you get some of that garlic,
you get some of that fuel, you get some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that meatiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take another puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just off the aroma of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting that acrid raw garlic for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely some garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very like, you know, when I say accurate,
I don't mean anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: unpleasant, but it's, you know,
if you've smoked a lot of GMO or a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: chem, you know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that unfortunately we were
born too late for it, but those skunk one
[SPEAKER_01]: terps and those true, really funky dead
body roadkill terps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The poopines, some people call it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily a negative thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, people breed stuff for those poopines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were highlighting this earlier and I'm
feeling it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very smooth smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ash isn't as clean as some indoor and
that is to be expected, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now going into our third joint of
this, neither of us have coughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very pleasant and terpy on my
respiratory system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inhale has all that funk and that chem
and the fuel and then the exhale is
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasantly sweet, almost like they may
have like finished with a molasses or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know personally in my garden in the
past, we finished with a molasses type
[SPEAKER_00]: product, um, or a sugar type product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to sweeten it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, there's all kinds of
ways to do that, including just letting
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you saying that I do get a distinctly
molasses-y flavor on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like gingerbread, really
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, this is a very pleasant smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joints burning great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, there's apparent resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top, some people would call that
the resin ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, overall really pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stone, you know, I've smoked,
this is my third one now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high on it is really, really good at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of clear headed as you start to
feel it build behind your eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then it becomes like a really
powerful, you know, full mind and body
[SPEAKER_00]: stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the bag appeal is not the same
as some of the indoor production work that
[SPEAKER_01]: is definitely more popular than this,
I would say that this smoke is
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find something as good
as, you know, this outdoor Donnie burger
[SPEAKER_00]: in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we're a couple of minutes
into this joint, the effects are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent to when we smoked it last.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pressure behind my eyes for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a classic more indica type high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super pleasant and thumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it isn't a straight THC blast,
which is what gets me excited about trying
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think so many of the strains that
are being bred for the metric market and
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages are really unfocused and just
a neurological blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not as pleasant as something
like this that does feel very harmonious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes sense in nature construct of
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like with these organic terroir
based outdoor Terps, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting a euphoric, pleasant in
pretty, you know, individualized to the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's based on how it was grown and you
know, what kind of, you know, inputs and
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really when you get those,
uh, I would, I guess the simplest way to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it is this weed makes you feel really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the living soil outdoor type weed
just, it's euphoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: On another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't compare that to dispensary
hydro weed, which, you know, to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people would just make you feel kind of
panicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas this stuff really makes you feel
enlightened or just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does feel like sliding on up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard people describe THC as like
being the engine of a plane and the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpians as being the rudders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when things are, you know,
out of balance, the plane crashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's a joy to smoke something
that's sort of harmonious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is just absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get your hands on some of this
Donnie burger, if you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the know, then get yourself some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, big shout out to future
cannabis projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody drop a subscribe and a like,
comment what you liked about the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if there's anything else you want
to see us review, if there's anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else, I think we're definitely trying to
get into Landry stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're super excited about outdoor,
but we also love good, good pipe weed and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, are just excited to share it all
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through that guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
