[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, Chad Westport here and I'm
sitting in my new Spider Farmer SC-5000
[SPEAKER_00]: tent and I'm considering going organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got a few hang-ups, I got a few
problems, a couple things in my mind I
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't quite overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So convince me I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, it's a 4x4 tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally it would be a 3x3 fabric raised
bed in here that I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just a few things that,
you know, like I said, I can't get my head
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a veg area and this will be a
flower area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm running living soil beds in
here, how do I take it from my veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: then put it into here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beware going from a non-living soil into
the living soil just for flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you transfer the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get the roots out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't really like the idea of bugs,
whether they're beneficial or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really trying to replicate the wild
kingdom in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is on my journey of exploring going
organic in here, who should I talk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you want to see me bring on the
show to try and convince me I need to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with some living soil in here versus my
normal pots, which I can move around
[SPEAKER_00]: easier, which I could fit more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I could transfer in and out easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sold, but help me be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who should I talk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please leave that in the comments section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the sign says, come at me
hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me at ChadWestport.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Instagram, Chad.Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you participate in this because,
hey, you might get me going organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
See you next time.
