[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned just feminizing in general
You know just to go back to like our
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we didn't really breed we didn't
make feminized seeds for a long long time
[SPEAKER_01]: and to be honest like we kind of I Don't
think anybody dragged us into it kicking
[SPEAKER_01]: and screaming but that is a good metaphor
for like, you know, I was didn't trust it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for quite some time and We played
around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were certain Things in the past that
really bothered me like there was only
[SPEAKER_01]: certain genetics that that would do the
sex reversal that's required to do
[SPEAKER_01]: feminizing and That was a red flag right
out the gate because it's like if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: only using things that readily Essentially
hermaphrodite, then of course you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: pass that hermaphroditic trait on So it
wasn't until we kind of like we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: master the full-blown sex reversal that's
required to make feminized seeds and Just
[SPEAKER_01]: get that to the point in which we could do
it like we've yet to come across a genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can't fully reverse from a female
to a male and so now we figured it out we
[SPEAKER_01]: got our formula so to speak of how to Turn
a beautiful female plant that we've you
[SPEAKER_01]: know vetted and are indeed and seeing the
flower and even smoke the flower and know
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's like fire and now we can
basically just turn that into a male and
[SPEAKER_01]: It it was a realization that like wow,
you know this really gives us as breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more kind of control and power over
what we're putting into the progeny of
[SPEAKER_01]: this breeding project because now we can
go and and pick phenohunt and pick what we
[SPEAKER_01]: call a receiver and That's what we've
always done for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've like found You know, it was like a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even remember when that we started
taking cuts off our best-looking plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and keeping them and then watching them
bud out and Being like alright,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you know having the cuts in veg
and alive and well like phenohunting
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you do basically and then you
know Smoking it testing it when the labs
[SPEAKER_01]: came in and picking that one and being
like alright pull cut number You know 10 C
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever the hell that we coated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can do that and Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would just go and find a male that like
looked good and smelled good and It was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, I would rub stems and you
know, how I represent a lot of it I'd come
[SPEAKER_01]: back and my nose would be like red with
the because you know how cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: those little hairs like the Microscopic
but it's a little hair sisal it hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so like I'd be smelling to find
that right turpin but that's the only way
[SPEAKER_01]: to know if the male has the Inherited the
traits that you need to continue that the
[SPEAKER_01]: breed the trait You know, and so you'd be
smelling those stems a lot unless you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to let all your males just grow out But
obviously that's like a major risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta kind of figure it out before
there Well, and even then like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at male flower and it's like you
you can smell it a little bit more then
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's still not like being able to like
choose a beautiful female and use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: make pollen, you know, it's just such a
more powerful way to breed and it really
[SPEAKER_01]: was the hemp seed industry that kind of
gave us data to back up like Because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know fem seeds have had for a long time
kind of this Stereotype that they heard
[SPEAKER_01]: more and and I'm not like here to make an
argument really one way or another but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been a mixed reputation it has a
mixed reputation and I honestly think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like largely because initially they
were being made from a specific genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: that would Do that readily it would
reverse sex readily and it was like that
[SPEAKER_01]: just didn't seem right and so Once that
wasn't a requirement to like use your like
[SPEAKER_01]: half of your whole genetic was made out of
this thing that would reverse sex readily
[SPEAKER_01]: then you know that made a lot more sense
to us as breeders and But then industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp was like immediately just like we
can't do this with clones because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to grow acres and acres and so
companies like Oregon CBD, for example
[SPEAKER_01]: just started doing real trial and analysis
of You know rates of hermaphrodism and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that and It was like well,
you know, we grew out 50,000 and we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: cut down five And it was like that's not
that bad, you know, so it became really
[SPEAKER_01]: clear that there wasn't You know,
and if you do regular seeds you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: to cut down 15 I mean aside from the
normal males, but it's like that the rate
[SPEAKER_01]: of issues was the same essentially whether
they so it wasn't the Feminizing that was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually causing the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the fact That you know,
you're never gonna grow a field of 50,000
[SPEAKER_02]: regular seeds if you have to sex them Yeah
Well, and I mean there's problems even
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to sexing even the best do
it I think was it mean gene that started
[SPEAKER_02]: the joke of the reggae males It happens to
the best of them with regular seed you
[SPEAKER_02]: really it's all about vigilance You
constantly got to be walking through your
[SPEAKER_02]: field and you got to check your plants It
can happen to you with clones it can
[SPEAKER_02]: happen to you with Femmes and it can
happen to you with the regs too like we
[SPEAKER_01]: all went to reggae on The river which was
always like the second week of August or
[SPEAKER_01]: those first first weekend of August and
You'd come back and there would be that
[SPEAKER_01]: reggae on the river male that you missed
You know like while you were gone setting
[SPEAKER_01]: up your camp and raging all weekend doing
the party The balls dropped that's so to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was busy destroying your crop while you
were having fun I did I did it once and I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that day and I'll always remember
that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was August 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep That was the day that I was like Oh,
wow, I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah one got away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's happened to the best of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, there's lots and lots of
learning curbs And that's why you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean obviously he has so much more
experience than me and you both do as well
[SPEAKER_02]: But even for me I feel really fortunate to
have been a part of this and to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like worked out some of those kinks that
every single grower experiences along the
[SPEAKER_02]: road because You can read all the books
ever but that doesn't mean that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna Walk by that potential male plant
and notice it right off the bat You can't
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you can't read your way into
training your eyes to catch something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that And there's a lot of instances that
are similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to just really know what you're
looking for You You You You You You
