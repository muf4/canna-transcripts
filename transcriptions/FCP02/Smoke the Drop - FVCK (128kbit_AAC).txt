[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing our second iteration of smoke
the drop and this time we're super excited
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring you fuck or fuck that's fire I
think before we get into this episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll you know, give a little bit of
reflections on the last one I think we
[SPEAKER_01]: were super stoked when everyone's feedback
particularly candida watched it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: gave some feedback on how they want to see
their product We can extend that to
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll definitely be more gentle look like
in the joints this time Even though that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not always how we spark up our dupes I
think we also are just making sure that we
[SPEAKER_01]: let the cherry cool And I don't know I
think other than that we're kind of onto a
[SPEAKER_01]: good format and we're you know Stoked to
to get into the fuck shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was super fun doing that video
last week This week like Pac said we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got the fuck or the fuck that's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some very coveted stuff There's
not a ton of it to go around and we were
[SPEAKER_02]: lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to packs to get our hands on some
and So today we're gonna go through it all
[SPEAKER_02]: and rather these three flavors that we
have and we'll smoke the drop for you 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think I'm only enough lucky enough
to get it because I'm a part of such a
[SPEAKER_01]: cool community So thank all of you out
there for making it so that we just kept
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunity to smoke the heading sweet
around totally Fuck is locally grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're organic I don't know much beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like you said, it's a pretty small
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine It's more than 20 or so
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only drop Seemingly a handful of
times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it's a perpetual harvest
by any means and Their last drop which was
[SPEAKER_01]: around December of last year if I'm not
mistaken December of last year January
[SPEAKER_01]: this year was really one of the most hyped
moments in recent memory We with the last
[SPEAKER_01]: drop had the opportunity to smoke the
cream smoothie, which was their entrance
[SPEAKER_01]: Into the proper joints bracket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got second place with that,
which was super cool They also did a guava
[SPEAKER_01]: frost from Norcom Nemo s1, which we
thought was really delicious and There was
[SPEAKER_01]: another one too that I'm forgetting that
we smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember off the top of my head
what it was either Yeah, there was the
[SPEAKER_01]: cream smoothie.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the guava frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and then there was of course the one
that I reviewed It was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lemon no de crusted gushers very
similar to the super sour berry You know
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out of the bay the people
really like that was I think my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: actually of the last drop This drop there
were three flavors in front of us that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna get into as well as sourdough
and the cream smoothie again I personally
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't love the cream smoothie gelinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not one of my favorite herbs
Yeah, normally and the sourdough wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually made available to me So my vision
is we're gonna start with the blue ivory
[SPEAKER_01]: the candy type cultivar then go into the
citrus hopefully Get a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_01]: energy boost and then end with the og and
that
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, but yeah, let's get this thing
sparked ma'am stoked to taste it So right
[SPEAKER_02]: now we're gonna pass this jar back and
forth and get a sense of the aroma So
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a little bit of like a spicy
peppery funk, but other than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really a pure candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Under circumstances where I
wasn't being particularly critical if you
[SPEAKER_01]: told me this was a lemon cherry or runs I
had a hundred percent believe you Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: how's that true cherry?
[SPEAKER_01]: candy almost cherry garcia type sweetness,
so I Pretty much agree with everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that packs just said especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the cherry garcia note is spot-on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Think that I think that part of this
part of this flavor profile and aroma
[SPEAKER_02]: profile definitely Involves a little more
funk, but on the top end you're getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of candy And really like Pac said,
you know Could exist within the same realm
[SPEAKER_02]: as the Runts or lemon cherry type candies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a little bit of a hazelnut
sweetness that I associate with the gelato
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good representation of its pedigree
100% absolutely I think that this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of thing that is just a slightly
different shade of something that's very
[SPEAKER_01]: ubiquitous But there are a lot of people
who only smoke candy and finding that next
[SPEAKER_01]: new green Candy, that's a slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Is absolutely a worthwhile pursuit
and I think that this is a great
[SPEAKER_01]: representation of that It's gonna be dope
so blue ivory is a collaboration between
[SPEAKER_01]: umami genetics and Watson Supply Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their cold heat set their cold heat which
is like a runs cooking thing is Super
[SPEAKER_01]: popular and then umami genetics to similar
work with a lot of the gelatos finding
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive traits
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the one thing that's worth noting
is they include a string called Seattle
[SPEAKER_01]: soda Deep back in their pedigree and
that's pretty consistent across all of
[SPEAKER_01]: their lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had a chance to try People have
a sort of off kilter staple their genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: lines a slightly different shade,
especially when everyone's using The same
[SPEAKER_01]: building blocks extensively having
something a little bit different can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome reprieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely What do you get on the dry fall
it's Definitely sort of minty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a eucalyptus note.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that sweet Yeah, there's a bit of a
pine, but it isn't a foresty pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more of a candy pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm Yeah, I get the eucalyptus in the
pine for sure Yeah, I actually don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really have a sense based on This rifle
how it's gonna evolve during combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to trying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah me too, man What were your thoughts
as you broke it down and rolled it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: so these actually were pretty good on the
extra biomass I you know was careful as I
[SPEAKER_02]: always am to remove the stems and the
water leaves and sugar leaves to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: best smoking material we can for our
doink, but I Mean just compared to last
[SPEAKER_02]: week's review.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot less extra biomass Doesn't
have anything to do with the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: the flower the quality of the smoke I just
noticed there was a lot less that extra
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass on this breakdown and I also While
being careful on each string got that same
[SPEAKER_02]: experience across the other two flavors as
well interesting and I think Well from
[SPEAKER_01]: Candido It seems like the jars we got were
mostly all talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This seems like more of an even mix which
isn't necessarily about them I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: a complaint that I did see lever to go
Fuck is that there's smalls on the jar and
[SPEAKER_01]: that really one of the most dear price
points of anything in the market I think
[SPEAKER_01]: the least anyone is paying is 108 and
people are paying upwards of a thousand or
[SPEAKER_01]: now You typically don't accept to see
small expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me to see smalls But that doesn't
really change the quality and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: first-hand experience when you're growing
in soil and particularly a new soil You're
[SPEAKER_01]: not always gonna get those amazing talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so what are your thoughts on the
note size and bag appeal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag appeal is Nice the scent is out of
this world and the weed is sticky on all
[SPEAKER_02]: of them However, I did note that there was
you know, a healthy mixture of smalls and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know more medium normal size nugs Like
pack said, you know that doesn't reflect
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly can be a reflection of you
know Many things one thing being trying
[SPEAKER_02]: out new soil or trying out a new garden
technique can be another reflection of you
[SPEAKER_02]: know It's the the grower may feel like
it's still smokable and it is smokable but
[SPEAKER_02]: at that price point the consumer has a
certain expectation that you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanted to live up to and You know
nothing negative to say about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just noticed that there's a decent,
you know mix of nub size in there Very
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are both pretty accustomed to smoking
smalls the growers that they work with Ted
[SPEAKER_01]: the slightest small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah more than real jars and so I
think that we can almost objectively say
[SPEAKER_01]: that it doesn't Impact the smoking
experience unless it's real sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: popcorn trunk from the grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's different The larf is very
different than smalls Smalls can be small
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs smalls can be pieces that were
knocked off of the larger nugs from
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming There's a whole number of things
but as long as it's not, you know frizzy
[SPEAKER_02]: crap from the bottom of the trunk popcorn
nugs then you're good to go I completely
[SPEAKER_01]: agree off rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gives me a strong I Don't know it's
very similar to Georgia pie cool It has
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of sweet wheat grassy tone that
you'd expect with runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has that baked good almost mired
effect dough Sort of thing that you get
[SPEAKER_01]: from kushments that can be really pleasant
It's very creamy it isn't overwhelmingly
[SPEAKER_01]: flavorful But it's good and it's super
clean
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm definitely getting the creamy
notes Kind of the back end has a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of that Georgia pie funk I Guess I
would say this is not as candy forward as
[SPEAKER_02]: we expected not to say it's not smoking
super nice I don't think we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to show the camera necessarily,
but it's smoking clean There's you know
[SPEAKER_02]: good combustion nice resin ring overall
Overall fine smoking experience But the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor is The flavor is leading a lot more
towards those more mellow notes rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than anything brighter to me There's a
little bit of leathery funk to it almost
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm getting I'm getting a little bit
of that eucalyptus note that we got on the
[SPEAKER_02]: dry pole as well I'm excited to check it
out again
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely like a fuller bodied
smoke than I expected just from the cross
[SPEAKER_02]: and the smell Overall not bad not bad at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of at this one is reminding me
of one of the white Mentos sugary Little
[SPEAKER_01]: bits of artificial vanilla and then a
meaningful cooling effect on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's tasty for sure Absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think that as I smoke it more it does
start to resemble the general candy gas
[SPEAKER_01]: type of LCGA bronze cultivars that are out
there in the market It isn't that far off
[SPEAKER_01]: though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very clean and beautifully grown
expression It has a bit of a cherry note
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm picking up on now kind of like a
cherry cough drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool Very cool that certainly,
you know that certainly plays well with
[SPEAKER_01]: the eucalyptus notes And then it's also
taking on this kind of almost maple syrupy
[SPEAKER_02]: sweetness Yeah, the the last The hit I
just took Had a forward sugary on the
[SPEAKER_02]: tongue kind of maple syrupy note You get
that on the back end as well halfway
[SPEAKER_02]: through the joint Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I feel like the sweeter notes
are starting To come out now that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked, you know a decent amount into this
Maybe we keep using the word subtle but it
[SPEAKER_01]: is very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is palestinian.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain times are subtles a
euphemism for Nothing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, it really is just that
they're sort of softer candy notes It
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't as aggressively citrus forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't as aggressively gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mellow, but it isn't Unfavorable
Yeah, definitely has flavor definitely has
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's good to know I mean we Me and Pax
We really like to pay attention to all the
[SPEAKER_02]: nuances that affect the smoking experience
You know, that's why that's why we found
[SPEAKER_02]: it important also to take some feedback
from the viewers and the farmers and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: as well and how we how we modulate our
consumption experience And a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer including us to leave the ash on to
insulate the cherry and make your head
[SPEAKER_02]: cooler Therefore protecting some of the
more volatile flavor compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it did get a little bit more
herbaceous It almost has like a smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: sorrel quality in the background that's
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it does desirable is the
really nuanced candy almost Contractionary
[SPEAKER_01]: type stuff that we're getting earlier,
but there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally Yeah, I think people would
be People would be pleased to smoke this
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think people have been I think
people generally happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the case that people are really
stoked I think that fuck went into this
[SPEAKER_01]: most recent drop with a really strong
reputation and Came out of it with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything intact, which is almost all you
could ask for Yes a brand that is
[SPEAKER_01]: commanding a top of the market price point
where people become so so critical
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely when consumers are paying the
top of the market prices The room for
[SPEAKER_02]: error is a lot lot slimmer and people pay
attention really closely to every detail
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said I think like Pac said fuck
came out of this drop with the reputation
[SPEAKER_02]: intact, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Literally what you said,
that's all you can ask for when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: commanding a price like that as well as
Being a new brand and they have really
[SPEAKER_01]: only Been around for a year maybe a little
bit more and I think grown in a meaningful
[SPEAKER_01]: way every time they've dropped which is
cool Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's great to see brands be able to
Expand their reach will maintain quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes you don't get to see those two
things go hand in hand totally In terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: effects and it's gonna be easiest to talk
about this one because it's our first
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke of this sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely stony Stonier than most
candies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was like a real heaviness almost
like fuzziness behind my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah big time This is definitely
definitely a stony one definitely gives
[SPEAKER_02]: you the behind-the-eyes effect At this
point, I've already had to read you
[SPEAKER_02]: certain parts of this tape just out off
half this joint So the power is there Fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck has got the power for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely does I think that just
because it's not A turf that's
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't one that I've returned to at
the price point, but I'm also not I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that particularly based on and I'm
forgetting what it's called But that
[SPEAKER_01]: legend og across the gushers from the last
round I was willing to return to fuck and
[SPEAKER_01]: I was willing to pick up a whole ounce
this time We already blew through a seven
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Kimber absolutely, which was really
really good I think that if this one were
[SPEAKER_01]: to come back Around I wouldn't grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also if someone were to tell me that
their favorite type of smoke is candy This
[SPEAKER_02]: is the one that I absolutely Yeah My
sentiment pretty much just echoes
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that packs just said Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel like we should take a second
Cool down because this is some super super
[SPEAKER_01]: strong shit and then we'll get into the
lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it guys Sweet, so I think we're
both Sufficiently big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally strong, which is awesome I
think especially at this price point if it
[SPEAKER_01]: can't offer that What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was rad and that was the
kind of joint that could get you through
[SPEAKER_01]: an afternoon Yeah, which I think is a
requirement when you're at the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: market 100% Totally, which almost makes me
scared to go through and stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of deemed to be a progression of
strength This is the rainbow lemons,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is gel in a cross to rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think it's the other way around
One of those yeah, but those are you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just again really really strong genetics I
think that the rainbow belts and Jelani
[SPEAKER_01]: and have lemonade and Z with them to
complement the gelato e tones That we got
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Blue Ivory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is going to have more of a
citrus underpinning We smoked some rainbow
[SPEAKER_01]: belts last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we talked about how especially
in the dry hole there were lemon e tones
[SPEAKER_01]: There was less citrus in the actual smoke
that we expected but This should be lemon,
[SPEAKER_01]: lime, trapezoid, limonene Strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is the kind of thing that
definitely can wake you up when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: very stony It can also get you even more
high in a different way than you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: both So we'll see which way it goes for us
It almost has like a mojito Quality on the
[SPEAKER_01]: inhale like mint and lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah big time mint and lime in the
forefront really enjoy it though I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to smoke it also sufficiently
confident that it's gonna get us
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally You want to light it up?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, let's take a let's do the aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do the aroma It smells like Z It
smells like if someone had like emptied
[SPEAKER_01]: some Lysol onto a jar of skittles it does
have that a stringent lemon lime cleaner
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really hardcore lemon lime cleaner
like but then there is That skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit And the Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but yeah my my my nose immediately
gets the lemon lime cleaner and then as
[SPEAKER_02]: you Finish your inhale or start to process
more of the things hitting those receptors
[SPEAKER_02]: in your nose There's more sweetness
grapefruit Z It's a it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious smelling dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm on the record is not really liking
lemon I know that you disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're gonna be the better
qualified to analyze That totally so why
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you spark it up and I'll let's do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll smoke along and try to Yeah,
let's see I think the reason I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon is that those herbs can be kind of
racy and anxiety inducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It is not so much the experience With
the palette and more the effects and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that that's also part of why I
wanted to put it out with the candy
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I do think based on this
historical experience if it is prone to
[SPEAKER_01]: induce that it certainly will Yeah,
even later in this rotation totally and I
[SPEAKER_02]: agree with you on that but happened to
have just historically really enjoyed the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor experience and You know sometimes
suffered through the more racy head change
[SPEAKER_01]: All the growers who are growing amazing
lemon turps and really You know Considered
[SPEAKER_01]: the best of the best in a lot of ways The
lemon being that a bunch of people grow
[SPEAKER_01]: that's Offered by the Kalia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which is Eddie let go G across the
lemon tree people love Trying to think of
[SPEAKER_01]: what else obviously the lemon up by mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cushing done bred by seed junkie I think
that's TK on lemonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always making waves I was in a room
earlier this week where people were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about their favorite weed of all
time with the connected gel in it When it
[SPEAKER_01]: first dropped which was not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I do think that lemon turps for
those Who love it really love,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think with lemon turps those
who love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely I mean, it's a it's also
it's it's not easy necessarily to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: fire lemon weed, but It's certainly a
palette staining profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get all up in your sinuses It'll
make you know, everything taste and smell
[SPEAKER_02]: like lemons at least, you know after your
head That being said it's not it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap code to good weed, but It's just a
It's kind of a cheat code to a pallet
[SPEAKER_01]: stater It is a cheat code to a pallet
stater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is Super true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said something that I'd love me to
circle back to that It's not super easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow lemon flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a good reason why?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just not not easy to grow good
weed in general, you know, that's true
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a You know, everybody's got their own
subjective experience about what good is
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know to us Just like without
getting too deep into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like things that are flavor forward
with nice, you know enjoyable euphoric
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences It's really kind of
encapsulates it that's 100% true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah totally because we can make a whole
video on what makes This weed good or not
[SPEAKER_02]: good to us, but we want to focus on this
weed We do and this is I mean just off the
[SPEAKER_01]: rip and that first jar I think super good
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your impression of this before I
go on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm getting nice, you know nice turps
from the first hits I always feel like I
[SPEAKER_02]: have to wait until the second hit to get
my first impression of what it tastes like
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you know the way we light our
joints with a torch lighter you end up
[SPEAKER_02]: combusting quite a bit to get an even
Cherry in the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah guys, I feel like I get all the
flavor after the first hit the light up
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I really start to judge what
I'm consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is tasty I think it's you know,
it's tough because the lemon strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm comparing it to are like we mentioned
earlier Considered some of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: strains in the world and the lemon strains
that are very popular right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though I don't love them are
Incredibly lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is more subtle it's more lemon
grassy very lemon grass it's It's more
[SPEAKER_02]: zest less candy lemon like you get some
tang in your mouth after the exhale I
[SPEAKER_01]: would definitely say lemon grass forward
and like lime zest too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you've using that word Lime
immediately sparked a ton of sense
[SPEAKER_01]: memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think you can blow it I really
thought it was very good though But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I was saying like lime zest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that moment and there's that
little bit of Green in the lime zest smell
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get hold of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similarly herbaceous Which is not
really something I expected in either of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cultivars totally but I'm really
enjoying I also think that from an effects
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective normally after having smoked
as much as I did Just now the lemon strain
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was going to be anxiety It would
have happened already and to keep it a
[SPEAKER_01]: buck with everyone between takes something
a little bit scary I do feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also a testament to strong
soiled ground flour Yeah, we don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: have a strong reason why it could be
psychosomatic, but generally clean flour I
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the top priority but then one
under that being the Soil yes and to
[SPEAKER_01]: generate the most Euphoric and sort of
peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is this is a lot more euphoric
than I expected and I definitely I Feel
[SPEAKER_02]: more leveled out then after we smoked just
the blue ivory.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one definitely has It has my my
favorite effect of the two so far Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's almost calming and cooling Totally,
which is really enjoyable on an August
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a glass studio with no AC AC
coming soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, get ready we're gonna be a lot more
lively No, but this is like super
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshing good summer tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like it I sort of am stoked to
have this jar because my understanding is
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was the most scarce of the drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's It's a cool turp The rainbow belts
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the extent that I'm getting
much from it other than just the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: mellow Yeah, in a funny way rainbow goals
is often described as diet C and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: certain certainly examples of rainbow
belts that are not diet C and yeah very
[SPEAKER_01]: Potent flavorful in their own right but
this has that creaminess the rainbow belts
[SPEAKER_01]: can have Paired with sort of the lemon
forward tones from the gel in it That
[SPEAKER_01]: makes this a really enjoyable smoking
experience This one is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor stays consistent At least
through this point in a way that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit tickling I'm finding
myself feeling a little bit of a sneezing
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I think volatile turps will do that
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah at this point in the joint for
sure like after that hit I just took it
[SPEAKER_01]: bit up those receptors Which is tough
because I feel like a lot of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: flower does it's hard to hold that against
flower though I I certainly enjoy not
[SPEAKER_01]: sneezing in the middle of a set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has what I would describe even through
sunglasses is like ice cream cone where it
[SPEAKER_01]: almost looks like it's melting into itself
that's sort of a Superficial thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: value but it's something that for whatever
reason whenever I see I do get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree So I agree with you this
is from an effects perspective my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: of the two I think from a flavor
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also my favorite And I'm sure that
based on the way that we entered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what folks were expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, yeah, it's even just the Yeah,
totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that I guess it's a classic case of
you know, don't judge them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't judge a jar by its cover Reminds me
of like a Like a lemongrass tea boba drink
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's has that cooling effect that I really
really enjoy Yeah Yeah, I definitely I
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely am enjoying the flavor on this
one and the effect There's something about
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of methylated experience
combined with the lighting up of those
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene slash flavor nerve receptors and
your sinuses It definitely has a
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshing effect And it's getting
stronger every time I get it as well I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that while I really felt the blue
ivory more behind my eyes This one I do
[SPEAKER_01]: feel is energizing But not in a racy way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's more like full body before
yeah 100% Yeah, it definitely is getting
[SPEAKER_02]: me It's gonna be pretty high every time I
go in for another rotation Noticeably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah not to use the same descriptor twice
But like this one does have a cough drop
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, but not cherry more like a
rickola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally Absolutely with those
whatever alpine spices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah With the alpine herbs and spices
there you go Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it really it has moved towards for lack of
repeating it, you know Alpine herbs and
[SPEAKER_02]: spices That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool to get that from you know
citrus to belt type of cross I wonder if
[SPEAKER_01]: there are even spices.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be alpine herbs alpine herbs
exactly So I this one I actually do you
[SPEAKER_01]: use this language as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel kind of leveled off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Smoked to really really strong really
enjoyable joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally, but the effects that were
really heavy Not sedative more stupefying
[SPEAKER_01]: from the blue ivory I've really Sort of
tapered off and I feel much more alive and
[SPEAKER_01]: articulate after the rainbow lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same here Yeah, going back to the
comment just on the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the I'm not sure if you guys are
getting a focused image of this if you
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this is the kind of this is the
kind of structure that is also a result of
[SPEAKER_02]: a fine grind just to return to that
thought and a tight pack joint and That
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't mean it's better than the loose
joint at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just How we like to roll our joints
and that difference for everybody totally
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think finding what works is what it's
all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely For me what works is having you
[SPEAKER_01]: We are gonna do it for you guys,
but yeah, it's a it's some strong We it's
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly it's intimidating.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, we do it for the viewers We
do it for the community and we love
[SPEAKER_02]: getting to smoke good weed So,
you know, it's a good afternoon Even
[SPEAKER_02]: though that shit is gonna be strong for
sure And I also think we do it for the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers not that we're any good at this
But I do think that people don't take this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff seriously Yeah, which is why even
though we're smoking we're having a great
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dedicating part of our afternoon to
trying to really Describe what makes flour
[SPEAKER_01]: Lake fuck so special because the market
has moved in a way where Especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated markets flour is very
accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over produced and it's cheap Yeah,
and there's not a lot of good consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so to be able to highlight why a
small independent organic grow that's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing everything right This product is
meaningfully better is really exciting It
[SPEAKER_02]: is absolutely so I had to Had to hydrate
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep it keep it hydrated and lit guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it And so like my thinking is
eventually people are gonna come into the
[SPEAKER_01]: space and do incredible Journalism and you
know, hopefully we're just a tipping point
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are gonna do it way better than
we could ever imagine But someone should
[SPEAKER_01]: be taking the time to really go through
these things and like Especially with the
[SPEAKER_01]: trillium timber that we're about to smoke
which it's a trillium Timber 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't highlight that in my review I
don't know what 2.0 means maybe someone in
[SPEAKER_01]: the comments can tell us but like it's an
ogee grown in the San Fernando Valley Not
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's an application of origin
because it doesn't involve the outside But
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's a meaningful historical thing
and especially coming up in LA both of us
[SPEAKER_01]: in the you know late 2000s early 2010s
like That was the best flower that was
[SPEAKER_01]: around that was the special local thing
And I do think in a lot of ways this is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most special representations of
it that exists today And so getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight it even though it's gonna make
me want to go to sleep He's gonna be super
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've always I've always been one to
chase the flavors that are found in ogee
[SPEAKER_02]: kush Finos and You know back in the day
like Pac said that was the best of the
[SPEAKER_02]: best weed out there, you know,
I've I've always found myself Drawn to
[SPEAKER_02]: them and I've always been appreciative of
their effects and flavor Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so like between taking dry heads,
I guess Yeah, man, that's like Honestly
[SPEAKER_02]: for me that is the weed that my first like
kind of cannabis mentor when I was very
[SPEAKER_02]: young Got me into and basically he It's a
guy that I worked with doing media stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so anyways So basically when I was
younger, I was doing really cool media
[SPEAKER_02]: internships and I happened to work with a
guy Let's taste taste awesome the dry
[SPEAKER_02]: pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I happened to work with a guy who had
grown previously to the media stuff we
[SPEAKER_02]: were doing and He was funny enough friends
with a bunch of growers and would just go
[SPEAKER_02]: and pick up a ton of ogee kush and so when
I was You know getting into smoking around
[SPEAKER_02]: that age I basically was exposed to real
connoisseur cannabis through the lens of
[SPEAKER_02]: ogee kushes and then I just really really
hyper focused on getting to try them all
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as I could experience as the years
went on and certain cuts were around and
[SPEAKER_02]: not around and then I ended up Getting
back into like growing stuff like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of more than a hobby doing it more
full-time And my mentor in that space also
[SPEAKER_02]: happened to be really in the ogee kushes
And so he was able to help further fuel my
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in it and show me some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't tried Yeah, I just fucking love
ogee kush Dude 100% and not to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: talk too much about kush before you get
into fucks rendition of ogee kush but Like
[SPEAKER_01]: my a lot of my release smoking memories
were jars that you'd bring around and I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have to care because you were
always bringing around the fire Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I'm pretty sure you were
bringing around the legendary stuff I just
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know the time like the Wi-Fi from
rascal the Paris ogee the mega wellness
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about some of the ones that
were particularly formative?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh totally I mean you just named a couple
of my favorite from like kind of the I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess we would say Temporary ogee kushes
because there was you know, there's The
[SPEAKER_02]: old-school ones and then there's the ones
that came along as more and more people
[SPEAKER_02]: got access to the genetics Mega wellness I
loved I believe that's like a Skywalker
[SPEAKER_02]: cut I don't know the exact law on it,
but that's what I've heard since I've
[SPEAKER_02]: tried it, you know really enjoyed it in
circulations of people I know also been
[SPEAKER_02]: able to try ones that were like supposedly
the same cut and they've been super good
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as Gosh what else the Wi-Fi was
cool because I ended up being in proximity
[SPEAKER_02]: to ogee rascal Just through like glass
stuff and so I was able to you know Try
[SPEAKER_02]: out his Wi-Fi and get some to share and
that was super bomb And I also through
[SPEAKER_02]: glass and glass collecting and interest of
glass blowing happened to be in proximity
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Paris ogee people And I actually
don't know what the exact genetics off the
[SPEAKER_02]: top of my head were on that what kind of
cut it was or if it was related to
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, but those guys were
really really cool and Happy to share
[SPEAKER_02]: their knowledge about weed and share their
weed and you know share their little glass
[SPEAKER_02]: like with somebody who is just getting
into it So, you know all those people You
[SPEAKER_02]: know all those people were super cool ogee
rascal and the Paris ogee people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Never met the nameless people,
but I really enjoyed the flower in the
[SPEAKER_02]: prop 215 days when it was more accessible
and grown in a way that was How people did
[SPEAKER_02]: it before the rec days and how people are
doing it now 100% I think we're Generally
[SPEAKER_01]: hopeful that the fuck truly Kimber Is a
good representation of that and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked a ton of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't I don't need to be hopeful I
know exactly what's about to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you think of the dry it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super super flavor forward on the dry
hit It's very citrusy
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, super citrusy almost grapefruit from
that dry it which is super nice
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a skittles grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah totally great food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has gas it has it has Funk it has a lot
of citrus and it has Well, I was gonna say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's almost like, you know, you didn't
crush white grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, let's smell it and then get into
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to smell because we Super
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You rolled up the last of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like yeah, I blew through a half zip
of this It was the one that everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to see the most I think it was and
I may have mentioned this earlier But the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that people really sort of focused in
on after the previous drop earlier this
[SPEAKER_01]: year 100% as being super special and if my
reflections of it were that it's yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a really good OG push a really good
OG push is for all of the reasons that you
[SPEAKER_01]: described as it being formative for you is
just Exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well rounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cuts through everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be really sedative And it also is
in a lot of ways the heirloom strand of
[SPEAKER_01]: the city that you know, we both grew up at
100% and Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean oftentimes most of my trips
to the valley When I was around that age
[SPEAKER_02]: were to go find some OG Kush and a lot of
a lot of good OG Kush was growing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: valley Also, you know the other valleys to
like the San Gabriel Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Central Valley I think it's
definitely a myth that there's only good
[SPEAKER_01]: OG in Southern California They're super
good OG everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything everywhere with the cuts that
are still alive totally totally succumbing
[SPEAKER_01]: to the viroid Can be found pretty much at
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are good regional specialties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I Thought some amazing Kush
grown all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just all based on You know what
the growers do it and what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics they got And you know Any anybody
in any place?
[SPEAKER_02]: with the right knowledge and experience
and genetics gross of fire and I think OG
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush is attributed as being one of the
parents to cookies alongside that one
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban and so generally it's thought that
It's a common parent of everything a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of our favorite flavors right now making
me more than you are cookies type stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed back to OG All of that is to say I
saw a post recently from I think CSI
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt that will Put something on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it for real that suggests that
maybe through gene mapping there actually
[SPEAKER_01]: is no OG Kush in cookies, which could be
Really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that with a lot of older cultivars
They were bad seeds and people don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what went into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I just know that it's so almost
axiom That like there's Kush in cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cookies in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Kush in everything And I think of
it as being really foundational So it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be interesting to see if as that
gets explored more there are cool
[SPEAKER_01]: learnings and I also think the truth is
there a ton of different cuts of cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as a ton of different cuts of Kush
total and in what way is those are related
[SPEAKER_01]: be it bad seeds or just similar things
that people then started marketing as
[SPEAKER_01]: being the same, you know I'm just excited
to maybe see what the mapping and cover
[SPEAKER_01]: this because I do think that while I do
Appreciate the anthropological approach
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting to understand every region and
subculture specific stories There's
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously like a yearning for some sort of
empirical truth, of course I'm also really
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to learn about cannabis gene
mapping because I feel like it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: either help dispel rumors or confirm some
of the Community knowledge that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: passed down about the origins of some of
our favorite cannabis 100% and like OG
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush is some of our favorite cannabis and
this is a good example I think that well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure this is what I articulated
in the review Well, there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon on the aroma and the dry pull not a
whole lot of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's more of like a fuel Gats almost
we're gonna have 91 totally and then from
[SPEAKER_01]: an effects group It's funny because people
ask me all the time like how can you judge
[SPEAKER_01]: effects when you're smoking all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is just sort of the color
that yeah in what you experience and good
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush always is slightly out of body But
then I feel it in my shoulders totally and
[SPEAKER_01]: like a good OG Kush or like a good chem 91
It's exactly that yeah Yeah, the power is
[SPEAKER_01]: really there with a lot of those good OG
Kush's the flavor is musty for sure Gassy
[SPEAKER_01]: dark What people describe as cushy and
that's obviously like a self-referential
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but I think that if you know,
you know, yeah Like little bits of root
[SPEAKER_01]: berry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah barkiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, totally there's the the forest
notes the like earthy almost kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: more like weirdly enough kind of like dirt
notes or like earth notes, you know And I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you would mention the leather I
think for the rainbow lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah to me this has a sort of warm suede
Thing going on about the exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Strong Yeah, this is definitely a
fuel forward one you get a lot less of the
[SPEAKER_02]: citrus there's some zestiness left On my
palette maybe in the form of kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: body of the smoke Lots of foresty earthy
tones Like you said the leathery tones are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming through on this It's it's
interesting because the the foresty tones
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't quite pine but it more resembles
like it just More resembles the like The
[SPEAKER_02]: scent and weirdly enough not that I have
tasted it but just the dirt of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: forest hiking path kind of like Northern
California a hundred percent and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Zesty is an interesting word because to
me, it's not a citrus zest It almost
[SPEAKER_01]: reminds you more moments where I've gone
and smelled through different like scents
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's like a vetiver patchouli kind
of yeah There's there's no sense but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not hashy incense like yeah It definitely
has some insensi notes though and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: some pressure Yeah, just a few hips in I'm
credibly faded I mean it oh gee kush makes
[SPEAKER_01]: me feel like You know, I'm taking bomb
rips sitting in one of those houses in one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the really scary movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally just
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, I mean The coach is
powerful Absolutely powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only probably taken five or six hits
off the whole thing at this whole point
[SPEAKER_02]: and You know, it's already impacting my
vocabulary my cadence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking strong Oh gee kush is some of
the best stuff ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that generally I prefer An OG that
has more of that pine soul thrust to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people do prefer these more
modern raunchy OGs and In that subcategory
[SPEAKER_01]: this is about as good as it gets totally
and I understand why it generated all the
[SPEAKER_01]: hype that led into this drop and it's
gonna generate more hype going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: next one because this is good good OG kush
and they're really only a couple of dudes
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it right and I feel like we're super
lucky to get to know at least a few of
[SPEAKER_01]: them I Think because oh gee kush I have a
highest quality something that's so
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible to us As I'm sort of reflecting
more on the entire drop the rainbow lemons
[SPEAKER_01]: is the one that I'd go back to Yeah,
the rainbow lemons is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked the euphoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got off of that It was a pretty instant
head change from the blue ivory I also,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know happen to be in proximity with a
lot of good OG kush and I'm thankful for
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I would have to say the
rainbow lemons is also what I would go
[SPEAKER_01]: back for Yeah, but I think we're just
generally really blessed in general they
[SPEAKER_01]: get to smoke very good OG kush and if you
were someone where That isn't available to
[SPEAKER_01]: you And you came across this jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the one that would give you
that Oh fuck that's fire response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're a little bit jaded when it comes
to kush This does have like a seismic yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're being pushed down to the
floor and the palette is really
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward I think that I could
confuse it for and you know, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: say because I wasn't around when this one
was originally around But like the
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions of chem 91 that I've tried
tastes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Totally and there's an earthiness
That I associate with certain more rustic
[SPEAKER_01]: kushes That's present here but paired with
a really strong kind of thin natural gas
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of jet fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that You know makes it very very
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the potency is just Out of this
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really strong It gives me it
gives me nice like OG kush nostalgia,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I love every time I get to enjoy
good OG It reminds me of Reminds me of
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of the good stuff that I tried back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Can't really put my finger on what it
is, but the nostalgic factors the flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: and sense memories are there sweet Yeah,
so I think that it's probably time for us
[SPEAKER_01]: to wrap it up I'm really glad we picked OG
for the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, generally this was awesome Yeah,
this was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I am pleasantly surprised I
think that To be completely honest the
[SPEAKER_01]: going rate for this flower is more than
I'm typically willing to spend on anything
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of really Incredible
flower available for a little bit less
[SPEAKER_01]: than this is going for but this is also
thoughtfully grown small batch flower they
[SPEAKER_01]: were phenome done which takes up a lot of
space and Once or twice a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to support Yeah, totally this is
great stuff, you know, we We enjoyed each
[SPEAKER_02]: joint thoroughly I mean it was it was
truly like a flavor and experience flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of brought us like brought us on a
