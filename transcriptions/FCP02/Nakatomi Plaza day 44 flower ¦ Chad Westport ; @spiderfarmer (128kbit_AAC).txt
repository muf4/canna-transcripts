One, two,
[SPEAKER_00]: Westport!
[SPEAKER_00]: The same height and three with the same
bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all similar, but again just trying
to group them into categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I did not defoliate, but the one
on the right side of the tent was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the same height, same shape, same
everything, except I defoliated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll kind of see if you know all of a
sudden the defoliated one has much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller buds versus the one with the
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: still on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just kind of a fun little
experiment that I'm doing on this grow
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I will say is this one still
has a lot more white pistols, stigmas
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, a lot more white stigmas on it
compared to this one that I defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is that related or was it just maybe
because I bumped some of them and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that caused them to mature early?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are these two Nakatomi plazas
and then we have this one in the center,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was one of the two taller ones,
but it actually shares the same bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure as the other two shorter ones I
just showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one I also defoliated just wanted
to create a little more airflow around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know, it's like I shaved the
legs on it, but the side branches are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud set is pretty tight on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the other Nakatomi plaza in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: at the ones in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that Nakatomi plaza in back
that, you know what, I mean, it really
[SPEAKER_00]: reminds me of the Westport grape juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this thing looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got decent, you know, buds on the
sides, just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't see because the camera so
freaking or the light so bright on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to move it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this one in the back,
which is just fucking doinking up,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is just putting on powerful
freaking colas on every branch tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a little bit of
nutrient issues with the lease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know what, it seems to be doing
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big old donkey cola here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do I need to like zoom out to get
it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the Nakatomi plaza in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on some nice fatty buds wherever
you look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one, whoo, the smell is pretty
damn pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 44 of the Nakatomi plaza grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are all being grown under the
Spider Farmer SE5000 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 480 watt light and they are in the
Sohum living soil, water only soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually given them one top
dressing of the kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This organics nutrient pack gave them one
top dressing a couple of weeks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, yeah, this has been
water only and they're in the three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, which is smaller than the size
that Sohum actually recommends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a really quick veg on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to flip them, grow them out
for everybody to see the Nakatomi plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you guys have followed this
grow so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a couple more updates coming,
I guess in really only a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, these things are going to start
swelling, filling out, turning brown and
[SPEAKER_00]: adding a little bit more purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also find me on my website,
ChadWestport.com and over on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chad.Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep it locked right here on the Chad
Westport YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until next time, everybody party on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four.
We're going sweet.
Chad Westport.
