[SPEAKER_01]: how I took over the yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with that one single 4x4 bed and
I added that one and I added around the
[SPEAKER_01]: tree and then did all that stuff over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also gonna rip out all these fabric
pots and put in wood at an octagon around
[SPEAKER_01]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a little garden project,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we gonna do?
[SPEAKER_09]: Build a hexagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna say, no bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: So see all these wood pieces?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're gonna do... Did you sand
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not sanded them yet, but we're
gonna make a hexagon.
[SPEAKER_09]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna pull all these pots out of
here and the hexagon is gonna go around
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a little over three feet
diameter or from like middle to middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: both sides.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you just making more space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I wanted to do was if I could get rid
of all these pots and then I could build
[SPEAKER_01]: the hexagon and then I could fill it with
all the soil from these pots and then when
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff grows down, it would also grow into
the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: See like this morning glory right over
there, which is yes baby cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the morning glory.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was a very good idea for you to
make that hexagon because this garden
[SPEAKER_09]: looks like a junkyard with all these pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why thank you!
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna make it look less like Sanford
and Sons junkyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is our cutting station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not really a good cutting station.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so there's our saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, who doesn't touch the saw?
[SPEAKER_09]: You.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am allowed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the opposite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to chop your fingers off.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's the opposite about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not be touching that saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so we're gonna cut each of the
how many pieces of wood are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hexagon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we already have two then.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing about six.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's six pieces of wood in the hexagon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does that look like deuce water?
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like deuce water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I dropped a big deuce
because it has I just made it so deuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I poured some water through the worm bin
and then I also put some if you ground up
[SPEAKER_01]: fish and it'll be a little stinky,
but plants love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you don't... Okay, so see how
this... Look at that with the camera.
Ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tap, tap.
[SPEAKER_09]: I tapped that, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you my super camera woman?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or how about you're my bro skin?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, so watch this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm just gonna turn it this way and
we're gonna do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I tell you something funny before you
do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love, but you gotta aim the camera
at me.
[SPEAKER_09]: One time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here... I think that's actually...
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna dump all these, re-amend them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put them in the... use that soil
in the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of times when I have way
too much food scraps, baby cake,
[SPEAKER_01]: they go, and don't tell mommy,
but they go under all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can see a butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That well, I'm sure you... And is it a
cute butt?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice!
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a good cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the 30 degree angle you were
looking for?
What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd make a box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a square or a rectangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the practical uses of your high
school geometry class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the wood dust is on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, five down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show that turd who's boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show that poo who's boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the boss?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the poo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who does number two work for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not paying attention to which side I
want on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got... Here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bottom of the hexagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got six pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are gonna go around the outside,
around the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, this will change from... And
I'm waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just harvested a bunch of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waiting for this stuff to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as that finishes, I'm just gonna amend
all the soil in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And use that as the volume for the
hexagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yesterday we cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're making a raised bed that is gonna
go around this tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna make a hexagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yesterday we cut the wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these 30 degree angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 degree cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you keep going, that would be a
perfect hexagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are each three and a half feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what we're doing is we're
gonna replace all these big fabric pots
[SPEAKER_01]: with just one raised bed around the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once, like here I have some
tobacco finishing and seeding out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that's done, I'm gonna cut all
that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll dump all the soil in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things... So this is some
heart redwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I'm gonna do right
now is actually char it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know like... I guess like ancient
Romans when they went into like modern day
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and France and were building
forts, they would char the tips of the
[SPEAKER_01]: timber that they would stake into the
ground so that it wouldn't rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Japan, they have a building
technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's called yakisugi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be a gross mispronunciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically I'm gonna char this and then
I'm going to stain it with some I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking flax seed oil or teak oil or
walnut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think flax seed is basically
something that's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also... While I do have a whole
lot of olive oil inside, I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna go rancid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'd love to use the olive oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, first up, let's smoke some
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is 24K crossed with Uprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what project is not more fun when
you are super high?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do not have my little helper today.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's... She's about to grab the torch for
the... Be a little less aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do one of these at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is I really don't care about
this grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually trying to fill in this divot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I...
[SPEAKER_01]: Have been dumping biomass in there to
build it up and then just letting any
[SPEAKER_01]: seed...
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is mullein seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see a bunch of mulling growing in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll... I put like... I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy shit on top of it to kill it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But... Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the home stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last...
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the six hexagon boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna finish...
[SPEAKER_01]: Charging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding all the... So where the knots are,
you need to kind of penetrate a little
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadly, I cannot find the compressed air,
so... I've been blowing these off with
[SPEAKER_01]: my...
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just use our hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is all so effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonna get all sooty anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soft, supple hands.
Oh lord.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soak it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got all three kids to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's daddy time before work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packing up seed packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll let these dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that looks dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the... But yeah, this will
look nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these six boards are the bottom six
inches of the raised bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna go 12 inches up around this
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the nasturtium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost done seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catching the seeds down there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we'll let this dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have five more pieces all done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the last of the bottom row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll let you dry right there.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, get some soft hands from the
flaxseed oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm gonna pull all this stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get shit out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm kind of trying to time
everything like the...
[SPEAKER_01]: These seed pods are almost done.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this one's finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really touch my phone with my...
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the seed pods here
finishing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's the nasturtium seed pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the mosh and the holy
basil also finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna... All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me pull all this shit back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Romanesco broccoli from right
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ready for the build.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, basically, pexagon right around
this tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now...
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is not nice to have like a
workbench.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could put shit on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll put you on the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we can do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start by just getting one right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if you're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're kind of right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ice cream truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the hexagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ground floor is down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah, that's gonna look nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the downside is that I need to torch,
wipe down, and oil six more of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically what I'm gonna do is
[SPEAKER_01]: get some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do the 10 inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically do row number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that looks like it'll be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna look nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I love the grassroots fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having like six of them around this tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this will look pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I won't make a mess again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making a little mess, a little mess.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daddy's making a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is lemon grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a good nappy nap?
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check what Mimi is making.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be inside in one minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making a mess and then I'm gonna clean
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who loves to make messes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you sure do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are kids over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go inside and I'll be in in one
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two more of these to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll start putting the second
floor on, which adds another six inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have 12 inches in total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want to get crazy at some point,
I could buy more lumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And add a third story on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to start, I think I'm gonna be very
happy with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the neighbors cut a tree down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have some logs in there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep getting more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so very satisfying.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll let you dry for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wipe, wipe on the legs.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, one log to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my my.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my, my, my, my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this would be much better if I was
not hunched over, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd play with the cards we're dealt with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wipe you down.
[SPEAKER_05]: My back.
[SPEAKER_05]: My neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: My back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows that song?
[SPEAKER_05]: My neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: My back.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing drinks up the oil though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, if I were the next one of these,
I do, I'll try to add some anti-fungal and
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-bacterial stuff to the
[SPEAKER_04]: flaxseed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll let this dry overnight and then
we'll do a second floor tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what my kids think.
[SPEAKER_04]: My toughest critics.
[SPEAKER_04]: All they do is tell me I'm fat and old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my back.
[SPEAKER_05]: My neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: My back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sing it, people.
[SPEAKER_05]: My neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: My back.
[SPEAKER_05]: My neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: My back.
[SPEAKER_05]: My neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: My
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to order dinner before the
Celtics game for the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me eat some pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pizza, pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the home stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got two more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to put some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, let me find the 10 inch ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: You are 12 inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are my 10 inch?
[SPEAKER_01]: My big 10 inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we're going to put some of
these like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have some 30 degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some 30 degree brackets that I'm
going to put here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you basically have one,
two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could even put two on the inside
of each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one over here and one over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we're getting close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those logs are from the dude cutting the
tree down right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grab those fortuitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Home stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bird food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll put this.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you help me?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since I didn't have anyone helping me
this whole project.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is it okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because it's I charred the wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll explain it all later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, how about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the wood lasts longer,
it doesn't rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one way of skinning the cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many ways to do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it move.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just let it move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so try to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Home stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wipe it on the grass over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the grass over.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not on your beautiful dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on the grass over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wipe your hands on the grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first wipe it on the grass and I'll
be done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just help me with this and
then we can both wash our hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't smell like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't smell like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're going to Taiwan in a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be like when I get back and
we're waiting to go to Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, just make, make sure you
don't get your beautiful dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hold on that side.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to do this on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this I want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not perfect, but probably took like
two hours or an hour and a half to do all
[SPEAKER_01]: the charring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to char me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you come over here and just kind of
put one hand, just a hand here,
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing down and a hand here, pushing that
actually not just, just right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't let it move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really worried about your dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just be super careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's good enough for anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gemma, you are all done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the home stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what I'm doing, the last thing is I'm
going to put these, uh, support pieces up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically possibly two on each one,
but at least one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either two, or just one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was gonna do corner brackets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So angled brackets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I ordered these, but they're,
even though it said 30 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, they're 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically not the right,
uh, angle, but they're also, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculously thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking more something that's like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so what I got instead was just,
uh, these little thin pieces of aluminum,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, which does last a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just going to cut them,
angle them, and then drill so that at
[SPEAKER_01]: least, uh, yeah, anyway, some additional
support, but it should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, let's start with these ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are one and a half inch screws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figured since the thickness of the wood is
two inches, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many of these do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got one, two, three, four, five,
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have eight of them, so we're just
going to do one on each, but that should
[SPEAKER_01]: be, this one looks, let's get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you out of the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So conceptually what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll just keep going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then this stuff, I
[SPEAKER_01]: still would like to find that straight
screw base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cut it, but it'll go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was thinking just kind of like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably go thicker, but that can
be the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, have you had since finding 30
degree angle brackets, it's not as easy as
[SPEAKER_01]: I had hoped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I just do boom and boom,
right.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in retrospect, I think like eight
inches would have been this is 10 and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half, which unfortunately you can kind of
see from the top, but
[SPEAKER_06]: we're getting so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful, Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember you have to listen to Nora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Nora says stop, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to stop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Nora, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Nora says stop, it's because it's
dangerous and there's a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't daddy say, put your helmet on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to wear your helmet when you
scooter outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get your helmet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My two year old loves to scooter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have one, two, three, four,
five, six, and flexing my ninth grade
[SPEAKER_01]: geometry skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, uh, switch this up,
drill some holes through the aluminum and
[SPEAKER_01]: do the corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ice cream truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This part we go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll go thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll do the bottom row later,
but all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll give it,
[SPEAKER_01]: so at some point I might, well,
one, I'll probably sit on this or put
[SPEAKER_01]: weight on it and my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I was going to put like a sitting
bench on the outside.
So
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are so cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take off your helmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adorable in your helmet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went so you caught Nora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to put plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are flowers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing I'm going to do is put,
uh, let's see if we can get some rocks
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been collecting from around the
yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are spots where it's obviously
isn't flat and level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take some of this,
the soil from the yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll break it down, but, uh, build it up
and then basically put kind of as much
[SPEAKER_01]: rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, once it's built up, but basically
put rocks under here so that, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the woods, not just sitting straight on
moist, wet soil all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, so I need to take I'm going
to put this in water and break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also get all the rocks out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rocks will be used,
uh, kind of under here and then we'll fill
[SPEAKER_01]: it with soil and we'll be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's take a look at our handiwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was saying, so I'm going to sand
down, like for example here, just that
[SPEAKER_01]: little edge right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll torch it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here kind of where this sticks
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, we got, this thing is not,
it's going to be rugged.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some support there and then on
the corners, uh, I might put one here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't really think I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that is very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we're just going to put a whole
bunch of these in the water so I can make
[SPEAKER_01]: it more like mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can actually break it apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that is going to build up some of
these low points and then we'll put the
[SPEAKER_01]: rock in, but like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically I need to level the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next project level and get rock
under, uh, the wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, basically I have this,
uh, this low area here that I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: filling in over time with biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can only put so much kitchen
throughput through the worm bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm constantly looking for places for the
excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a nicer edge.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over here, we're going to do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this with logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such as this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some snails underneath and,
uh, other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut a lot of branches off this tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to fill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to, I've been letting it dry
for the past couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all crunchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw that in and then some of the soil
from the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will plant some plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think next I'm going to put,
I'm going to build probably like a four by
[SPEAKER_01]: eight over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe two of them going that way,
but this is looking dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got some ABC plants that are going
to go in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Australian bastard cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of you because we don't want that
to die while we're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is definitely a male because I
re-veged it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is a cutting from it just in
case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one, two, three more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a whole bunch of other seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a seed increase at the
Australian bastard cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of weeks later, this is the
end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hexagon around the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some other random shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm trying to, uh, I'm going to
cut down some bamboo and basically create
[SPEAKER_01]: stakes and, uh, create some height and
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the viney stuff like the,
uh, the morning glory can climb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these little pieces of a branch
that I've kind of created a little ladder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can plants can viney plants can
grab on.
Okay.
