[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's Sunday, October... I don't even
know what day it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do some field notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now moving into our sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not just doing afghan anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one right here is actually purple
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... We have a bunch of military jets
flying over our property right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry about the... Sounds like we're in
a war zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway... Ignore them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is purple haze though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredibly chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you this one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite sure about the purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not seeing any purple at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But absolutely beautiful chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say they're just a few days away
from being ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just complex sort of different fruits
and kind of rotten fruits and melons and
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly rotten melons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a really complex melange of
different fruits and rotting fruits with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very bizarre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the purple haze, which I
believe the story on this is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: originated out of Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually this is almost like a
land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then let's look at the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another purple haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it seems to be right on schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's about ready as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the feeding requirements on this
was, yeah, probably could have handled a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year we're going to have bigger root
space area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I never want to risk
overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, it looks looks just about
right, but very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a third one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it's all the way up there in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's on schedule as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's just go up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think this one's the furthest
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to get some brown hairs and just.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what the smell of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this has more melon like a musk
melon situation going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, anyway, purple haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like a Santa Cruz land
race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to harvest
probably this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
