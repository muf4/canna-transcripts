[SPEAKER_01]: You know, last week we did a strain
history thing on the white family,
[SPEAKER_01]: white widow, white Russian, white,
you know, great white shark, all that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff, white rhino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've mentioned before that
one of the things we wanted this to do was
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than be some sort of like
definitive layout of what happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we would tell things as best we knew
them, okay, and that we welcomed people
[SPEAKER_01]: that were in the know or had information
or what have you, to come out and to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, message us or talk to us or what
have you about all that, that added more
[SPEAKER_01]: information we didn't know and some
nuance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after we did that, that happened in
spades because Shanti Baba reached out
[SPEAKER_01]: with a bunch of clarification,
clarifications on our white, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it would be, I thought it
would be cool to read and comment a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit back and forth on some of the things
he said so we could add his take,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to it, give our own opinion,
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll dive into this week's strain
history and then we'll dive into sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the core of this week's show,
I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look down because I have to
read this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually pretty interesting
because it goes into, it goes into some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the shadiness that goes on in our world,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he wrote and said, Arjun,
or Greenhouse Seed Co., never trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: adjectives like white widow or white
rhino, etc., as it is not allowed to own
[SPEAKER_01]: the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is only, they only put the regulation
symbol to let people think this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed the names of the strains to do
the correct thing when leaving a company
[SPEAKER_01]: so as to make clear the distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would know when they were
buying things from me and when they were
[SPEAKER_01]: buying things from the previous,
you know, previous regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's interesting about that is that
when I read that, I was super amused,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously, when you see a
trademark symbol next to a name,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, you assume something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, and sometimes assumptions
makes you a a-hole, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Arjun did this thing apparently,
which was very clever, and that he figured
[SPEAKER_01]: if he put a trademark symbol on it,
he wouldn't get caught and everyone would
[SPEAKER_01]: assume that he had done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty clever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought because when you would
buy those packs after Shanti left,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would all have the trademark symbol,
and then he changed all the names,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you think, okay, well, he obviously
had to change the names because there was
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark involved, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently, that was totally untrue,
and it was just a thing by Greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_01]: make people assume that that was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it probably is also for the best
because when someone leaves a company,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when they're going to, you know,
go off and do their own thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seed reproductions have to occur,
you know, existing stock doesn't last
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there likely is, you know, a distinct
difference, even if it takes a year or two
[SPEAKER_00]: to occur between the same line,
even if it had the same progenitor sold by
[SPEAKER_00]: two different companies because your seed
stock will run up, and you will have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make new, and you will not have the exact
parents, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you left somewhere, you know,
not on the best terms, not everyone's a
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, fucking splitting up everything on
the way out, like, there will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even beyond, you know, the trademark is
probably in the best interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for people to be able to decide
what version they liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Peter put something up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read it, actually,
because I have it in front of me,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think Shanti's words deserve,
he's really an OG in the scene and has
[SPEAKER_01]: done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And contributed a lot of lines to the
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's probably cool to just,
like, say his own words about the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll chat on in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I also made the seed versions of
all that you discussed, as Ingmar's story
[SPEAKER_01]: of finding a seed in a piece of hash does
not allow for breeding unless it was
[SPEAKER_01]: chemically induced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, if you follow things a bit
further, like breeds called critical mass
[SPEAKER_01]: or super silver haze or the CBD strains,
you will clearly see I went on with seed
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and innovation while most others
went for sales of fem seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not making an opinion just stating
facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since this widow seed came out in 1995,
if you look prior to then where there was
[SPEAKER_01]: no seed, no seed for widow, nowhere,
it was just a plant and a cutting story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I do not really care anymore
about what stories are popularized,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it amazing that people still have
their theories when all seed companies who
[SPEAKER_01]: copied my seed version use my words that
were written up by me in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: seed code days.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one really uses anything from Arjun or
Ingmar when it boils down to descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that clears up some of the
thoughts and some of the stories from the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be well, all the best, Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple things I'll say about that and
then I'll turn it over to crybaby.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one, I should not that it matters,
but I should put my finger on the scale
[SPEAKER_01]: and say that I tend to believe Shanti
Baba.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we were just trying to offer up the
two stories that existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if you're Shanti and you and you
created it and you popularized it and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it was probably a little bit of a
bummer to hear a version that included
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say I do believe him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all intents and purposes,
he is absolutely correct in that the
[SPEAKER_01]: larger weed scene had never heard of White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the person that released the seeds
and the early hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every single person that bought
those got Shanti Baba's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's 100 percent accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's really what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and, you know, so everyone's
getting Shanti Baba's work, whether it was
[SPEAKER_01]: at Greenhouse Seed Co or later on at Mr.
Nice or what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Shanti making the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Shanti selling the seeds,
you know, whether or not this clone story
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever is true or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very localized to Amsterdam's
Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shanti Baba releasing the white family
under the greenhouse label in the mid 90s
[SPEAKER_01]: is absolutely what put it on the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't, you know, I mean,
I I just wanted to throw that out there
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, we're trying to be
objective and offer things that we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so that's that's we've had
two things now with our stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first was Bodie Bodie giving us some
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Jim Ortega had given him about the
Kush 4, which was lovely addition to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have Shanti coming in and
talking about the white family and adding
[SPEAKER_01]: some trademarks and some extra,
like, you know, nuance to it and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is also super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also something to be discussed
about various differences, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the campus community between, you know,
what we could call like true origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: the very, very first iteration and you
know, projection of something onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can say, you know,
when was, you know, community spread and
[SPEAKER_00]: popularization occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as much as I hate to say it,
you know, sour is a great example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who had that those
plants, that plant, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you look at the broad scale
popularization of that plant, when the
[SPEAKER_00]: masses got it, what they might know of it
might be a little bit different for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is something to be said about
whether or not the origin of a story
[SPEAKER_00]: relates exactly to how everyone knows the
end point result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of how White Widow might
have got there, the point isn't very true
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you were into White Widow,
if you bought seeds, if you grew plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you grew hybrids, you did grow Shanti's
version and barring as far as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people with a, you know, expansive reach
and reputation, barring Luke from
[SPEAKER_00]: Paradise, I don't know anybody at all who
has a prolific breeding program and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cites White Widow as being
critical to the greater part of their
[SPEAKER_00]: world and what they've developed besides
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's that's I'm not saying
that one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen them run side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, how it got there, how people know
it definitely is mostly single source and
[SPEAKER_00]: the handful of people otherwise,
you know, what they have to say is equally
[SPEAKER_00]: as valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, on a broad scale, White Widow,
you are talking about Greenhouse or Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice seed origin plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody, everybody that bought White
Widow and crossed because it was a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: seed line, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then, everyone that bought it and
crossed it to things and made hybrids of
[SPEAKER_01]: it of their own and everything else,
you were buying the you know, what Shanti
[SPEAKER_01]: had created for sale, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't need to we don't need to deep
dive too much more into that except for I
[SPEAKER_01]: would like to say that we view the strain
history portion, right, as a continuing
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's lovely that he was a listening
and B was willing to add his thoughts and
[SPEAKER_01]: critiques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you are willing to engage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, willing to engage and be polite and
nice about it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're talking about something,
and you have an area of knowledge about
[SPEAKER_01]: that, and you're like, oh, that was wrong,
or that was this or that was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: right, but there's this context to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means, reach out, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll probably end up, you know,
like on the continuing conversation like
[SPEAKER_01]: we did now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next Dutch mob joke I make might be
about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
