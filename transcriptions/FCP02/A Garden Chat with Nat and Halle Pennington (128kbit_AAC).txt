[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the church of Cali High,
Cali High, Cali High.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Cali High episode 66,
a garden chat with Nat and Hallie
[SPEAKER_05]: Pennington.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host, Chenzo, and in this
episode, we return to the world of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis for a talk with Nat Pennington
and his daughter Hallie Pennington of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt Seed Company about the origins of
cultivars, registering strains in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombia, searching for land races in
Jamaica, the development of triploids,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I found out has nothing to do with
three leaves, old strains, new strains,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as scratch and sniff cannabis,
and more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cali High is stoked to be here with Nat
and Hallie Pennington today of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: A beautiful spring day in Humboldt,
and spring is finally here in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: as I'm sure it's there for you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's big spring after all the rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just trying to keep the bugs down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the bugs are going to be bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided to do the interview in our
little kitchen garden outside of our cabin
[SPEAKER_03]: out here at the anchor farm, the Humboldt
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been here since Hallie was a little
tyke, and right now, there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: other folks in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cooking up something special,
so I knew it would be too crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy loud in there, so hopefully
everybody hears us okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll fix it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little Sunday brunch going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're making hummus,
which I've never done that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what it was was we cleaned out the
pantry area, and they found some cans of
[SPEAKER_03]: chickpeas that needed to get used.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have an Armenian girlfriend,
and her mother taught me how to make
[SPEAKER_05]: hummus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our own garlic every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a little garlic garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been saving the seeds for too long
that I can remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the time of year where it's like
you got to use it or else it doesn't stick
[SPEAKER_03]: around much longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to harvest the other big patch
of it over there too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to grow some food as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, I've only got arugula,
basil, cilantro, and Italian parsley,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's a start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I moved out here in 1995,
the first thing I did just right down the
[SPEAKER_03]: road in the little town of Orleans in
Humboldt County is where most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer's market farms are for Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt has, of course, Humboldt State
University, which is now Cal Poly
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Arcata, it's one of the bigger
farmer's markets on the whole West Coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point in time, it was the biggest
in the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I came out here, I was 18 and
I needed work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically hitchhiked my way out here,
and I worked on these organic farms down
[SPEAKER_03]: there in the big valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really what made growing
cannabis sort of natural for me was not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily going onto the internet sites
and having to buy all the fancy
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredients, but just knowing the basis of
organic farming was really, I feel like it
[SPEAKER_03]: made a huge difference for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, well, this stuff seems a lot
like the tomatoes, and all we did to those
[SPEAKER_03]: was this, that, and the other,
and boom, we had tomatoes galore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next thing I know is like, I got a lot of
ganja out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've been trying to not buy any more
soil and just re, you know, keep the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: alive and, you know, maybe add a little
worm castings or whatever needs to be
[SPEAKER_05]: done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've even tried some compost pots and I
got a 45 gallon pot that I'm composting
[SPEAKER_05]: in, but yeah, organic is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always tastes better that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I, I heard that,
um, it's better for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always talking about the tomato
analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, yeah, that tomato that you
see in Safeway looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I can see right through it,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, tasteless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's shaped nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, like, it's not a single spot
on it or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, but I can see like,
literally I can see the weird mealy
[SPEAKER_03]: texture inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my biggest pet peeves after growing
up with him out here is when I go and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: order something like, you know,
a caprese salad or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're expecting these beautiful,
like super flavorful, amazing tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get served one of those like nasty
mealy GMO tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's just the most
disappointing thing after you've had like
[SPEAKER_00]: endless perfect fresh tomatoes all summer
long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're really heirloom, you know,
they, they seem to be the better tasting
[SPEAKER_05]: of the ones that I find at Whole Foods or
somewhere like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, maybe try growing some tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I, we always said like
cannabis is the garden gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it like, seen a lot of people get,
you know, grow some, some weed plants
[SPEAKER_03]: cause they, you know, want to smoke their
own, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with that,
but it's, I think it's cool that it gets
[SPEAKER_03]: people just back in touch with,
you know, playing around with growing
[SPEAKER_03]: things, nature and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we've got basil in our little
garden here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got our auto flowers right behind
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can see them,
but we'll go on a little tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you will walk around the spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I, I've been doing my
research as usual and, uh, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: what really, uh, something that caught my
eye was, uh, your five questions was
[SPEAKER_05]: Forbes magazine, but that was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more than five.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's, let me start here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I read somewhere that you were
registered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you registering strains in Columbia?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now are those like Colombian strains or
your strains?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you register a strain in
Columbia?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the countries and you know,
we have been definitely putting ourselves
[SPEAKER_03]: out there across the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think earthquake alert.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's good thing you're outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, it's a 6.0 off the coast of Northern
California, but, um, we're not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're inland.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's far enough in humble that this
earthquake is probably not affecting us,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's, that's a pretty significant
earthquake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's happening right now in,
uh, maybe near, you know, our office on
[SPEAKER_03]: the coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I hope everybody's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll find out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask my wife to check it up on
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have to interrupt the
interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as people might know, earthquakes
are kind of a normal thing.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lived through two big ones down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just recently had some, uh,
I'm talking about, what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, 71 and 94.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like freeways fell down and, you know,
you know, so Hallie, you were there for
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the one on the coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you, that was the wild ride,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a few good ones in the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, there's been a few that are
like, are long drawn out ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be just shaken and for long
enough for you to sit there and be like,
all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, professional camera adjuster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, did it turn upside down on you or
anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I think I saw the little, the stand
that you were putting your phone on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did have our phone on a stand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So back to you, um, registering strains in
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as cannabis kind of becomes,
you know, legal or whatever regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: across the, the globe, we obviously want
to participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we feel like we definitely have
something to share and offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, in Columbia, it's,
they, they have this very onerous process
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's a lot of companies or a lot of
countries, I think should probably try to
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid, but it's, what it does is it makes
it, if you want to produce cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have this very long, several year
process to get your strain or cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would probably call it, uh,
registered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, we did initiate that
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have one, our blueberry muffin is
registered down there, but it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, uh, it's a little bit ridiculous
because as I'm sure anybody who's
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in cannabis in the United
States is aware we're as breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: collectively, you know, whether just in
the U S or even internationally,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're like very quickly coming up with new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have something that,
I mean, our blueberry muffin seems to
[SPEAKER_03]: withstand the test of time, but generally,
you know, two thumbs up on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The life time, the lifespan of a cannabis
variety or strain is not necessarily super
[SPEAKER_03]: long, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had been, I mean, the OG Kush of
course was popular forever, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course there's going to be some
classics that always stay around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, our blueberry muffin
was a great option for this project
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, that's one that I'll
smoke probably until I'm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: about to corrode basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are things that, you know,
we at least have new, better crosses of
[SPEAKER_00]: new versions of, and even for the
blueberry muffin, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we've, we've made our blueberry
cupcake lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're always hunting and looking
for the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to commit to, you know,
the one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, the, the guess is,
is that either that's going to be one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those rules down there that doesn't always
just, you know, that a lot of people just
[SPEAKER_03]: collectively decide to ignore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but nonetheless, yes, that's been an
effort to get some things registered down
[SPEAKER_03]: there and, and a value effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's been, you know,
Ben, Ben Lynn kind of has been going out
[SPEAKER_03]: and sort of reaching out to some of those
international markets, but they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is great, but you know, we've seen a
lot of them are as, sort of volatile or
[SPEAKER_03]: even more volatile than what we see in
California and the U S in general,
[SPEAKER_03]: where, you know, you can make your very,
very best guess about what the smartest
[SPEAKER_03]: move is to have a, you know, at least
sustainable business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can totally be, it's, but I think
it's a great press to dip our toes into in
[SPEAKER_00]: a sense, because also like, as you
mentioned, it's so volatile that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know that, you know, in the next few
years, regulations couldn't require that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all over the place for us to
even do in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you're up and be prepared to
end up in that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we absolutely have to, I mean,
by all means, I would like to wait as much
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork as possible, but that's just not
the reality anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, were you able to like locate any of
the old good Colombian strains and bring
[SPEAKER_05]: them back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some, um, I know Ben brought
some Colombian strains back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went down to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people watch our YouTube, we've got a
cool video about collecting land,
[SPEAKER_03]: land races, uh, and you know, the
interesting thing about that is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that things have changed so much in the
last 20 years that while it is really cool
[SPEAKER_03]: to incorporate those genetics into new
efforts and new breeding techniques and
[SPEAKER_03]: practices, um, for us, it's, we're very
comfortable growing the land-raised
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics ourselves because we don't have
expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't depend on producing flour and
having it be a certain way to make our
[SPEAKER_03]: living where, cause we're strictly looking
for seeds and new, you know, it's getting
[SPEAKER_03]: windy a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: New seed varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, um, land races are,
are great and they sound very romantic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you're like, you know,
this land race from, from Columbia or
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica that's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is, is that, you know,
we haven't even had the concept of
[SPEAKER_03]: seedless cannabis hasn't really been a
thing for that long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, except for in Thailand seedless,
they, yeah, that was the first seedless I
[SPEAKER_05]: ever saw tie sticks.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They must've just been really on it with
that, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Thailand, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, um, I've grown what was
purported to be land race tie and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing, it's like, it's something the
Hmong like the hemp from the Hmong tribe
[SPEAKER_05]: mixed with something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the, but the funny thing is,
and I was arguing with somebody about it
[SPEAKER_05]: and telling them they don't know what
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like five days later, I'm in whole foods.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for the elevator to go up to
the bathroom and some guy comes in and we
[SPEAKER_05]: start talking and he says he like lived in
Thailand for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, so I ask him in, you know,
if he speaks Thai, we start speaking Thai
[SPEAKER_05]: to each other, waiting for the,
the elevator.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have this whole conversation
in Thai and then we go to the bathroom and
[SPEAKER_05]: we come back down and he takes me out to
his car and he's as old as I am.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And spent time in the military and has
been living in Thailand for like the last,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, maybe besides the last two years,
about 10 years before that and long time
[SPEAKER_05]: before that long story short, he opens
this trunk, there's a big bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: He pulls out two giant nuggies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't smelled that since 82.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he's like kind of a ski bum guy and
I probably won't see him again until like
[SPEAKER_05]: the snow has melted, but he's got the
seeds and I know where we talked about
[SPEAKER_05]: where he sourced them.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got them from a chief of police in a,
in a location I will not divulge at the
[SPEAKER_05]: moment, but it's the real tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so maybe we'll one day we'll get that
to you that that's something worth having.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we had, we had Thai strains about
eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a few Thai strains and they were the
most supposedly of course, but they were
[SPEAKER_03]: the one of some of the most frosty,
beautiful cannabis buds that we had on the
[SPEAKER_03]: farm that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was thrilled and, and you know,
cross some things into them, but then of
[SPEAKER_03]: course, you know, we got into the world
of, of testing cannabis potency and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were testing like 13%.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, you would assume that
the, the frost and the trichomes that you
[SPEAKER_03]: see on buds are somehow correlated to the
potency, the THC potency of these such,
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's not the case at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have some of the most frosty,
beautiful looking flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back testing, you know, 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always disappointing when that is the
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they, you know, they probably have
cannabinoids in there that we just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not smart enough to look for yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing is that that's the
huge problem with basing any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: decision on the laboratory results that we
have right now in, in like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to, it's tough for us with
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like, you know, having to
choose between, you know, whether we're
[SPEAKER_03]: making our customers happy or we're
following our passions or we're,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, clearly there's no denying
that cannabis that doesn't test very high
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if growing commercially,
then why in the world would you grow
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you can't sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just, that's all just very
basic logic and there's no getting around
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like unless you're some kind of a
independently wealthy trust fund,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people are always like giving us
a hard time, like, you know, Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: why do you, you know, worry about THC or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just like, because we just
don't, we're not, we don't have tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: money, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not like, we're doing this as a,
you know, it's a business and
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately, like we haven't taken any
investment money and we don't have,
[SPEAKER_03]: even if we had, you know, like our
investors would be even more on us about
[SPEAKER_03]: doing just high THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall goal is the business needs
to at least pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we didn't break even, we would,
you know, we wouldn't just, it just
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't happen because we wouldn't have
the work people working.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't have the, you know,
I mean, the goddamn licenses are so
[SPEAKER_03]: fricking expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's getting a little better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've realized that they, you know,
made some mistakes, I think at the state
[SPEAKER_03]: level and at the, even at the local level.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I saw something about taxes
being bundled into a different category or
[SPEAKER_05]: getting rid of some, and just making one,
the United cannabis business association
[SPEAKER_05]: down here was, working with this,
I think it was the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know exactly the outcome of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good things happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good stuff, whether it was,
it's too little too late is yet to be
[SPEAKER_03]: seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, it, there are so many big mega
farms, like, you know, there are many that
[SPEAKER_03]: are over a hundred acres at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just a lot of like real irony
in the industry that you just say,
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes you wonder whether there is a
greater sort of plan to just kind of take
[SPEAKER_03]: it away from people that may have been
rebellious in, in, in the original growing
[SPEAKER_03]: of it, you know, sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, once politicians get their hands on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, once politicians get their hands
on it, I think, you know, which they kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of already have with, since they are in
charge of legislation and things like
[SPEAKER_05]: that, it just kind of ruins the whole
cosmic vibe of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's crazy now because, you know,
we're seeing like even what 40 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road from us, there was a
facility built out that I think took
[SPEAKER_00]: around $18 million investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now going up for auction at 3.5
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you think about it, like that
opens the door for all these people that
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of walked right in and be like,
all right, you know, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is already all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was 40.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took 40 million in investment to make
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I mean, it's worth what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, unfortunately that $36 million
is those investors are bums.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, you're right though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody could jump in and swoop it up and
at least make it fairly profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only have to pay 3.5 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a bizarre thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, but you know, there weren't,
I always say like the pendulum swings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Humboldt, we still have this like
incredible knowledge and wealth of
[SPEAKER_03]: experience of people that have held out
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we lost some of them though,
to like really easy mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, when, when people were around
us, like taking millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars in investment money, we were
somewhat kind of like, Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, are we going to be able to
survive?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though we're something that's like
here, how they made me put it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just hold it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even if we had a totally different
niche,
[SPEAKER_03]: it still was scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, we were like, shoot,
what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the sad things was that the,
I think that'll work great.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the sad things was that the,
the County and some of the elected
[SPEAKER_03]: officials were kind of like took those
projects more seriously than the small
[SPEAKER_03]: local person that had been here.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so we, we were kind of always
getting, you know, our applications and
[SPEAKER_03]: permit documents and things we're getting
sort of, uh, attention last.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just say, or, or cast to the side
somewhat it felt like, and, and the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that were like, Oh yeah, we just got,
you know, got another $10 million from
[SPEAKER_03]: some rich person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, so now we've got,
we'll do whatever you want us to do as far
[SPEAKER_03]: as our applications and blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten consultants writing the whole entire
thing for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you should have seen this first
initial application that he submitted and
[SPEAKER_00]: he wrote pretty much all of it himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a binder this thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, he wrote a novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beyond Astor's thesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, and you know, I, I had experience
writing grants and writing environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: documents and reports for the Klamath
river and the salmon and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank God I had that because a lot of
people that, that didn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the consultants are helpful and great,
but sometimes, you know, they just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they're, they're not like,
if your project doesn't make it through,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not out of a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they have 20 projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not a lot of real care and
knowledge going into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't want to say that because
there is a lot of the time care and
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge, but, and they have,
I mean, their consultants could have done
[SPEAKER_03]: way better than I did, but the fact that I
did it, I think made when I would call the
[SPEAKER_03]: County and say, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't, you know, heard back or,
or I just want to, you know, you to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: me that at least I'm in good standing now
because you know, you haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: communicative and, and I know I turned
everything in that I was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see, you know, Joe down the road
just got hauled off in handcuffs last
[SPEAKER_03]: week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really want that to happen to
my family and I, so am I good or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd be like, Oh, let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are your own consultant or you're,
you're writing all the documents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, actually, yeah,
you are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always like, we've never seen it
done like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can't poke any holes in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, I wrote my own, uh,
conscientious objector application for the
[SPEAKER_05]: U S Navy as the first Buddhist,
uh, conscientious objector on the grounds
[SPEAKER_05]: of bad karma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually succeeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, no lawyer would take my case,
but what, you know, so, um, so another
[SPEAKER_05]: thing I read that you've developed scratch
and sniff cannabis samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's got a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually my wife, Amber in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when, yeah, that was
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it didn't really take off the first
time though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we're a little ahead of
the times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not trying to brag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually, it's a fricking pain in our
ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always kind of like a little ahead
of our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab in my old bedroom when we were doing,
we were doing tissue culture in 2015,
[SPEAKER_03]: 16, and then we kind of realized at that
point, we were kind of like, ah,
[SPEAKER_03]: this has some good utility, but it's not
like, and now it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: been the hottest new thing to do across
the entire industry from the last three
[SPEAKER_03]: years to get lots of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, if you mentioned those words,
little buzzwords,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's advantages maybe to clean a genetic
or just to preserve something for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time for any kind of like,
you know, scale production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, uh, not the most practical
option.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's onerous and slow and it takes a
really long time for the plants to come
[SPEAKER_03]: out of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas like with seeds, they are actually
cleaner than tissue culture entirely,
[SPEAKER_03]: like nothing, tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tissue culture can still have hoplite
virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the seed is very, very unlikely to
have it inside the embryo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, seeds come out of
their shell, rearing and ready to go and
[SPEAKER_03]: catch up and surpass clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as like how big you can get a plant
in no time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, tissue culture seems to kind of
like creep back into reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's sort of like needs to wake
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a long, long, slow wake up,
but we don't want to just sit around a
[SPEAKER_03]: dish, tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was a greenhouse right over
here that if my wifi was a little better,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just go walk with you, but we'll try
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, um, we had blueberry muffin in
there and what was it that it made me ask
[SPEAKER_03]: Amber?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so my wife, Amber is like,
if you could just make a scratch and sniff
[SPEAKER_03]: with this smell here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it's such a potently smelling
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, she was like, that would just,
people would love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh man, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just said, you know, and the
first time we did it, we did it with the
[SPEAKER_03]: magazine and we, we had, uh, the turpent
extraction, which, you know, Ben has
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten super into the turpent extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does that a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, got that and then found a
place that would, you know, do the process
[SPEAKER_03]: of actually turning it into something that
lasts a long time in the scratch and sniff
[SPEAKER_03]: ink type form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it's a fairly natural process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really, you're just taking the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essence, you know, the oil and,
and putting it into, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a format that is not only is like lasts a
long time and easy to share, but it also
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't have cannabinoids in it because
that's the only thing that it really
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it, it really takes all of the,
the essence, the turpents and the esters
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and the flavonoids and all the
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many things beyond turpents
that make up the real smell of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it carries all of those, but it won't,
carry the, the waxy, uh, compounds that
[SPEAKER_03]: are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so leaving those behind may affect the
smell ever so slightly, but, but we feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I mean, you get the benefit is that
it, it's completely and totally legal as,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like non THC, you know,
whatever you, not even have, it just
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't have anything in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe there's a perfume line in the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked with the brand that made a,
a perfume line and a cologne line out of
[SPEAKER_03]: our cannabinoids or out of our turpents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fog and tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might've been a tad bit ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ahead of its time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still had such a stigma around it almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I first smelled it and I was like,
this smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea, but I also was just
imagining whoever squirts them on their
[SPEAKER_00]: wrist and then hops in the car and
accidentally gets pulled over on their way
[SPEAKER_01]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, ah, this is going to be a hard
one to explain in some situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, when you guys, to your original
question, we're like the tangent masters
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like tangents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told Hallie, cause I used to do
interviews for the salmon stuff and have
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes these like, you know,
press would actually want to like rattle
[SPEAKER_03]: you and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd always be like, you know,
it doesn't matter what they ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just talk about what you want to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So apologies that that probably carries
over sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we did do a salmon interview one
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, now the dams will
officially be 100% out of the Klamath
[SPEAKER_05]: river next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: End of next fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first dam will be gone this year at
the end of this fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really do a lot of this stuff
over the winter just because of the high
[SPEAKER_03]: flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then by next fall, um, they will have
a completely free flowing Klamath river.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, like the, as I've told people a
million times, these are like antiquated
[SPEAKER_03]: dams and they don't produce like the power
grid.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Pacific or was in negotiations with
us, we would talk about that and they
[SPEAKER_03]: would, you know, we had a guy take us to
the side and he was like, you know what,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we were to just shut off the,
the, uh, breaker for Klamath dam projects,
[SPEAKER_03]: we wouldn't even see the needle on our
overall grid move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it would move as much as,
you know, like it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were basically like, it's and,
and the fact is, is that every single year
[SPEAKER_03]: we have to build 13 facilities that
produce the equivalent amount of power as
[SPEAKER_03]: those dams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are always like, Oh,
you're taking out all these, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what, what they would call renewable
energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you know, this,
this destroyed like the entire salmon run,
[SPEAKER_03]: the third largest salmon run on the West
coast of the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, where every single year we
have to build for 13 of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to get that salmon run back,
we have to build 14 one year, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what the f*****g that doesn't,
you know, there's no, no difference there
[SPEAKER_03]: and they don't store water.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they, you know, they don't control
floods because they have to be maintained
[SPEAKER_03]: full for the power plants to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just this whole terrible design of,
you know, the, 1930s, 40s, 50s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no, you know, no disrespect to
those engineers, but they just didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: think about this kind of stuff back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, you know, Oh,
there's more salmon than you could ever
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they had, you know, like if you'd
go into the, I always say like back then
[SPEAKER_03]: there was so much salmon that they never
could have dreamed that it would be a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really think about it, like on a
scale too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's not that much time
realistically from 1930s to now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating what has happened to the
impact, the negative impact to benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's like, you know,
completely out of whack in my opinion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think the natives will be happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't limit it because of the dams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the last time that I
even, you know, went for a bit of a knee
[SPEAKER_00]: deep in that river, just because it's so
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, I don't let my dog near
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if he drinks the water, he could die
in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we wrapped down it, but I don't
mean I don't, but at certain times,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, at certain times there's like
warnings and it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's because of this, these unnatural
algal blooms that happen in the reservoirs
[SPEAKER_03]: that will be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's really exciting for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's exciting for, I think a lot
of the Pacific Northwest because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people just don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're in California, but we are
part of the Pacific Northwest here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I mean, we have redwoods and
we have, you know, coniferous forest and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, look right behind us,
you know, that's, and obviously it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: rainy all year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still have like, that's one of the
beauties of Humboldt and why I think
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis became so popular from here is,
you know, we have this very unique climate
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, you know, partly cold nights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, last night it was probably
50 degrees, 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little campfire and had,
you know, s'mores cause we had friends
[SPEAKER_03]: over, but you can do that all summer long
in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things I love about
Humboldt is like it, always cools off
[SPEAKER_03]: enough that you can enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, today it doesn't feel
like it's going to get quite as hot,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yesterday it was, it got to the
nineties, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plants love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going to ask you guys,
how many states are you in?
[SPEAKER_05]: And does the market different,
differ from each state to state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely is pretty different in every
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that we've kind of had to
adapt to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some places that have
legalized and gone in that direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but haven't really ruled out regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, as someone who's trying
to establish, you know, very serious
[SPEAKER_00]: brands somewhere, it's hard for us to jump
into those doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, New York, for example,
has been a little bit of a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't want to, you know,
get a property or maybe make any big
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions until they let us know,
you know, what is going to be okay and
[SPEAKER_00]: what isn't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did do a little satellite in New York
and kind of had a nursery operation and
[SPEAKER_03]: made it so that people could get seeds in
as legal of a way as they could,
[SPEAKER_03]: or even get plants in as legal of a way as
they could in New York last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people, like the state didn't
really have it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not their fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no one's fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just like we were kind of ahead
of our time a little bit, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we didn't need to have that
significant of an offering over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, we were there,
though, and we definitely met a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really helpful for a lot of
people that we were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made it so that maybe we broke even
instead of, you know, making any money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's just the way it goes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, you live and learn
and it's like, it's all just part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot to complain about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot to be thankful about,
I think, in some respects, just being that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have this niche and that we,
you know, like I started breeding cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: in 1997.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Humboldt is my youngest daughter here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that was great timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had and saw that there would be a need
to have seeds and new types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really followed that passion and
stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we have one more
established seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were your original cultivars that you
started with way back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was somewhat before they really
had, I mean, before cannabis was had so
[SPEAKER_03]: many names, you know, it's kind of like
still pretty clandestine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the very best things that I
came across as breeding and selecting and
[SPEAKER_03]: selling cannabis in the medical,
you know, framework that we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in California for so many years were
not things that came to me with strain
[SPEAKER_03]: names.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just this is these are really
good seeds from from, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these ones came from Southern
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, you know, Ed's favorite last
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, a lot of them had different
descriptors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, there were varieties around
like train rack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no such thing as Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no such thing as.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there just wasn't very many
strain names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did have, you know, there was a
thing became popular that they called
[SPEAKER_03]: Salmon Creek Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's like probably not a
name that people would choose these days
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's like, you know, it's so.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was a type of weed that made
big buds and it came from a place called
[SPEAKER_03]: Salmon Creek.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was Southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sort of famous places where weed
came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I'm sure people wrote on
their bags a lot of the time, Salmon Creek
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Bud, and then a lot of helicopters
went up Salmon Creek because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would always imagine like a lot of a lot
of weed is, you know, getting picked up
[SPEAKER_03]: going across the country with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that I wonder where this came
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it says it came from Salmon Creek and
it's big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the first ones we worked with
didn't have names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we obviously had train
rack and we just got everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We literally that's one of the beauties of
of Humboldt is that like really it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: such a massive hub for cannabis that
pretty much every kind of cannabis has
[SPEAKER_03]: made its way through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people brought some of the first first
Afghani cultivars that people actually
[SPEAKER_03]: brought back from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a friend whose father was here in
the early 70s and specifically went on a
[SPEAKER_03]: mission to go find seeds in Afghanistan
and Nepal and in India and brought them
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, he could be responsible for,
you know, 80 percent of modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: just doing that one trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, that's his dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: His dad will never let I begged him
before, like, please do an interview or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, tell your story of doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, you know, those guys had
their fun and they have those stories to
[SPEAKER_03]: share with people that they know and
trust, but they're not not always super
[SPEAKER_05]: excited to, you know, really, you know,
I did interview Bobby Ackerley of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Brotherhood of Eternal Love a few years
ago who had gone to Kandahar and driven a
[SPEAKER_05]: Volkswagen van full of Afghani Primo back
across Europe and then shipped it to the
[SPEAKER_05]: East Coast and drove it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those guys also brought seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the, you know, legends of Maui
ended up being like crosses between the
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghani and the Wahakan or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you still if you go back that
far, try to make keeping the seeds out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis was not common at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every every everything had seeds in it,
except the try we try sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which that's really interesting that you
brought that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you know, we figured out kind of
mastered the whole sense of media with
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds or cannabis without seed in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I first saw it around like seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: First California seedless.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like four times as much as
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of five hundred a pound,
it was two thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so here's something interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the development of triploids?
[SPEAKER_05]: We we were talking about that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Triploid is fairly high tech seed
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, technology, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a flow cytometer to be able to to
check and make sure that they they are
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, as you say, they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so so that's pretty high tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they they should be sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory, they are not always sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finding out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they for the most part, if your goal
is to grow seedless cannabis, which
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously is the goal of most commercial
people, then then, yes, it's a better,
[SPEAKER_03]: much better option for not having to worry
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's also I mean, there's other
benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to increase the yields on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, it was found to be like
around at least 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still you know, there are some
people that have been making triploids and
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp, and it's still definitely in its
sort of like infancy for especially for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, for THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it there are a lot of indications that
triploids will potentially produce sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: superior commercially, more commercially
viable options than than diploids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for folks that are aware of all this,
it's been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, seedless watermelon or
triploid, they're bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberries actually are octaploid a lot
of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ploidy is how many sets of chromosomes
are in the nucleus of each cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not including reproductive
cells, which are usually just haploid,
[SPEAKER_03]: which means one single chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way that you make triploids is you
you can use I mean, they occur in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll also occur naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a much lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're it's really rare to find
it, but you're reliable for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would be reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't it doesn't carry on past
that unless you grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got some out of the squirt from last
year, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend turned them on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a different what you're
referring to is when you see the three
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves, right, the the three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that's called is the world
taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people often assume that that is is
triploid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really common early mutation
in the beginning of a plant's growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it'll produce the three first sets
of true leaves and then sometimes it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: just eventually go back to normal to where
it's like the, you know, parallel opposing
[SPEAKER_03]: nodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So triploid is entirely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something that you can observe
externally at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that you would have to have
a flow cytometer to or or do genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing to be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's it's beyond my pay grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because there's popular
cultivars that have been released by like
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known breeders and they didn't even
have any idea themselves that it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: a naturally occurring triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was maybe part of why it was
their selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was probably pretty dense,
fielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you know, obviously drawn to
it for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, then again, it's not
something you can observe with the naked
[SPEAKER_00]: eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We discovered that the MAC1 is a triploid
and nobody had any idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: MAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capillator strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, did Richard end up reaching
out to him and informing him of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think he even knew up until
the scientists that we work with was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, bud, I happen to test this MAC1 and
next thing you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, do real triploids have also
three leaves?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you know, especially in a
vegetative state, it's there's really not
[SPEAKER_00]: any identifiable markers that,
you know, you could tell apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the exact same leaves,
you know, same structure overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are starting to monitor basically
just to see if they really do have more
[SPEAKER_00]: overall bigger and also, of course,
you know, yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we produced about, what are we up to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 10 different types of triploid
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're testing them out right now all
across the state, actually across the
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be our first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bringing the triploids into our
annual phenohunt process, which is always
[SPEAKER_00]: a big thing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to participate in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's probably one of our
first real field tests where we see them
[SPEAKER_00]: next to a population of, you know,
diploid cannabis plants as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we talked about this and the
selection process is somewhat limited,
[SPEAKER_05]: but how did you select males when you did?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as people probably know, more and more
seed companies have joined us in doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we've kind of, you know, we've been
doing this for 25 years at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that technology wasn't as prevalent
before, and we didn't utilize it for the
[SPEAKER_03]: first 15 years of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we selected males in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We rub the stems, you know, when they're
about this tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still do this, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they're like this tall,
you go out, you just like rub the stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's like little they're actually
trichomes that are having a different
[SPEAKER_03]: function.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get kind of idea of the I mean,
you can absolutely tell, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them will just smell three times
stronger than another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that's what it was going to be
probably your cultivator or cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe the one that you know,
and also, I mean, just the obvious things,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have some that are, you know,
almost double vigorous than another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be that you might want
to select for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's always there's always
good things to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it doesn't really compare quite
to being able to look at two female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, then you imagine the exact
traits that you want to see out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get what you're saying about the
feminized process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why it's so advantageous aside from the
fact that you end up with all female
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, which kind of makes it easier for
the for the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you want to explain it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, yeah, it's the fact that
when you're breeding with male on female,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're only getting that female flower
visual of the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is always this portion that
is kind of a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing your best educated guesswork
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if we look at it and make sure
the structure is great, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nice and vigorous, pest resistant,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from those things, you really don't
know what it would look like as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when feminized breeding came along,
it really it just gave us the opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually, you know, set our eyes on,
you know, exactly what we're crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for brand new crosses, that's really
important, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for people that don't understand,
how do we know exactly the female,
[SPEAKER_03]: what she looks like when we're making
feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because we go female hunting
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we take that that selection that
we've made and now we put silver on it and
[SPEAKER_03]: it actually effectively changes it to a
male now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has the same chromosome,
the same DNA that's the plant that we
[SPEAKER_03]: looked at two months ago, but now turned
it into a male plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore it makes pollen that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, that has the the DNA of that
beautiful flower that we just looked at
[SPEAKER_03]: two or three months ago or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it takes a long time to do this
shit, but you could do it in three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory, but it's usually harder anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we then reverse its sex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we've got this plant that's
putting out pollen that has female all
[SPEAKER_03]: female XX chromosomes, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the reason why when it lands on
another female plant, the stigma and the
[SPEAKER_03]: ovum, the ovum all on female plants has XX
chromosomes as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have this coin flip that you
have with regular plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took, you know, I was at UC Davis doing
salmon genomics with some of my best
[SPEAKER_03]: friends there that are professors there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would talk about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just go over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the potential problems with
breeding this way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I didn't want to jump fully into
it like we have without understanding if
[SPEAKER_03]: it was going to negatively affect the
species or if I was going to be doing
[SPEAKER_03]: something terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just not really negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can do it wrong and there can be
negative, you know, you can create more
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphrodite traits in cannabis by doing
it incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but we learned quickly how to do it
properly and we don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we don't see we keep really,
really good data about any reports that
[SPEAKER_03]: come back from the our customers about
hermaphrodites and the percentage of
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphrodites in regular plants is
regular breeding is just as high or
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes even higher than that of the
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do pretty extreme stress testing on all
of our breeding chambers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, throughout the entire
process, we're almost weekly checking on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's, you know, anyone that has
a herm sight on it, it immediately gets
[SPEAKER_00]: taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, it's not going into
production at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't you can't stress test a male
plant for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, so that's another I mean,
it just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reasons that we prefer feminized
breeding over regular breeding just
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't ever seemed to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just been ridiculous how much better
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, some people are like,
oh, it's not natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, I mean, it's colloidal
silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I dropped that in my earache and I
use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get, you know, like if I have a sore
throat, occasionally I use it for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, literally,
I it's not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we put it in our silverware and
put it in our mouths every Thanksgiving or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in your current market breakdown
between feminized, autophobic,
[SPEAKER_05]: autoflower and regular seeds, what's the
percentages there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you mean feminized autoflower
versus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have of the three types of seeds,
you have regular seeds, you have feminized
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and you have autoflower seeds,
which are also feminized, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how does that break down as far as what
people are into?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like 90 people are buying 98%
feminized now for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still get people buy the regular
because they want to do breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to, you know, have their first
foray into breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I would say, you know,
if you're trying your first foray into
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, maybe it is easier to do regular
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is definitely is easier,
but I mean, I still would, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe say it's not a bad thing if you jump
right into feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're always going to maintain a
regular line here that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're always going to try to keep that
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do do regular breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, what do we have now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down to 10 to 12 regular strains at this
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, 50 of the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about the new strains?
[SPEAKER_05]: What, what are you excited about now?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Favors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the art is going to be really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_03]: The orange cream pop is coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're breeding that one right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of wish I'd walk you over there to
the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe what I'll do is I might try to
send you some pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can edit them into the episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a little video.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I walk over there with how we can walk
over there with how we can walk over there
with how we can walk over there with how
we can walk over there with how we can
[SPEAKER_03]: walk over there with how we can walk over
there with how we can walk over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you part of our orange cream pop
selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have our jelly donuts selection
happening over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, be a little window into
how much work goes into making something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is.
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The orange cream pop is three years in
preparation to actually put it out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is, you I know the guys that
we actually did the scratch and sniff with
[SPEAKER_03]: Burris Place and One Straw Farms down in
Calaveras, which if you want, Hallie will
[SPEAKER_03]: send you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing this massive fino hunt this
fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fino Frenzy was your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a fun name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and catchy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're basically opening the doors
where normally it's more of a private
[SPEAKER_00]: group fino hunt, but we're going to fight
some of our just industry friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: our local colleagues, and of course some
press folks as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'd love to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get out into these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have 10 farms that we're going
to be doing it with, maybe more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't track already, but you know,
it's going to be a ton of finos and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, a lot of selecting to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to have our little rating
sheet with about 10 different categories
[SPEAKER_00]: that we try to observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, of course we're not doing
this on every single plant, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you're walking through and you start
to notice what really catches your eye,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know, everyone kind of gets in on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always go back at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll revisit probably like, you know,
the lot of 20 that somebody rated good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone turns in their sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, these all got, you know,
nine through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all go check these out again as a
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did this in 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did 10,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, I think we had six,
seven farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That year, this year, we haven't settled
on the exact number that we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's not as much about that as it
is just, you know, getting a broad
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're going to look through some of
the stuff that we did with the Sensei seed
[SPEAKER_03]: bank and maybe try to see if there's some
skunk, old school skunk genetics we can
[SPEAKER_03]: find.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to really open it up,
but also keep it tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our phenotype rating sheet is
still, it's always been available for
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody to download.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pretty much still use a lot of the same
variables that we did in 2017,
[SPEAKER_03]: 16, 17, 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was kind of when we formalized
our pheno hunting processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like everybody in the world now
is, pheno hunting is such a popular word
[SPEAKER_03]: to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets thrown around a little loosely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think when it comes down
to it, like, you know, we're really doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it in such an in-depth and scaled way that
I don't think there's any way we can do it
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 10,000 plants.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was kind of like, you know,
we knew that the shit was about to hit the
[SPEAKER_03]: fan and California was going to be a
monster of cannabis and cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, whatever it's like,
be careful what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in that, not in that feeling of
that coming down the pipe, I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's fricking do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, you know, the good part is that we
have a lot of different, we can look at a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of different kinds of weed around the
state with all of our partnerships and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's, you know, make a phenome out of
this massive industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so year one of California
legalization, we were out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, looking through 10,000 plants,
trying to find them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I mean, that's been huge
for us since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had even some of those varieties
that first year still are big for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've refined them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whenever you find a phenome,
it's like, now you found a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the beginning of your job as a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that is literally step one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like ridiculous that we're in
because so many people are just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a cool clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to, you know, get really rich
and famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny because you'll see
things they get released once and that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, we have beautiful
clone lines and firsts that we've found in
[SPEAKER_00]: this process too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, is sometimes when you get
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get these genetics and people will,
you know, our local friends and farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: will be like, Oh, I've been running this
lately and I've been loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should check it out,
try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is, you know,
sometimes we'll make a little phenohunt
[SPEAKER_00]: cross just to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you plant these things and it's like,
there's genetics and things coming up out
[SPEAKER_00]: of these random, you know, basically clone
lines that you never would have thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you have like, you know,
a short little stumpy sativa or I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: indica looking one, a long stretchy sativa
looking one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see grandma, great
grandpa, smell like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that you could throw in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you breed those clones,
basically like you, you actually open up
[SPEAKER_00]: what's inside of that genetic and you're
getting this whole mess of muddled things
[SPEAKER_05]: more than just the one clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus like before we release something,
like he said, with the orange cream pop,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been in the works for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because, you know, we want
people to be able to say it's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone trying to do their first time
breeding or a gardener that just really
[SPEAKER_00]: likes stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all kind of want our stuff to
smell uniform enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while you're like, you know,
we're not going to just set them up with
[SPEAKER_00]: something completely random every time we
call those phenohunt lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's, that's what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, kitchen garden here behind
us and it's, it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not our focus at all, but I still
want to be able to have a BLT in June and
[SPEAKER_03]: July and be like, yes, this is the,
the best time to have a BLT.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I planted a whole bunch of brandy
wine tomatoes, which are like my favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: big juicy heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead I got one that was kind of
like a brandy wine and I got cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: tomatoes and I got those weird ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are meant for sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got these other ones, you know,
dada, dada, dada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be pretty pissed at that seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, man, there goes my BLT,
you know, like don't mess with my BLT
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, but how dare they throw in a
Marzano.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love those too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have to do another little stop in a
minute here, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I take the show for a walk?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll walk up over to show off some of
these new varieties that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can get excited about them for next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'll just do solo cause I
don't know if the internet really is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to reach over there where we're actually
getting some new repeaters and routers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be good up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time we try it then, you know,
or do you want to just film and then send
[SPEAKER_05]: me films?
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can definitely film and send you films.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep it to like five minutes tops and
you edit down whatever you want,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Hallie and I'll go walk over and show,
um, you know, show what's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys enjoyed the podcast,
the Callie high podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about the, the jelly donuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are jelly donuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: For selection right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already selected out quite a few of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our receiver number one and then
the receiver number twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it'll be most of the receivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then orange cream pop was another one
that we mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a block of the, uh, orange cream
pop in development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be selecting out of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already pulled some out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some hibiscus here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do we have here?
[SPEAKER_02]: The C4.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new thing that we haven't even
named yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some hubble headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have here?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a granny candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another strain we're working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might call it berries and cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't exactly decided yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: New genetics sort of in trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good old lemon grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one we've had for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking nice and uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And squirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta redo that one this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to make some more squirt for the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more orange cream pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of orange cream pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange cream pop is one we're really
excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, um, there's a lot more that I
could show you, but this is the farm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watering our garlic plantation over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our metric center, tool center.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: More seedlings coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing more important than labeling
incredibly well when you're a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we're doing some projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking for the very best strains for
extraction purposes with, uh, bear
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got strains from four or five
different breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: All just hunting what's the best to,
uh, to do, um, mostly, uh, live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're washing some more hibiscus here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hella jellies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're staggering everything this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't have just, uh, you know,
everything coming at once, which we
[SPEAKER_04]: learned is pretty important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Staggering is crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
