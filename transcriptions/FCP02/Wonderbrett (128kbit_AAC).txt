[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes When you wake up And you feel like
you need a little up When you're down and
[SPEAKER_00]: out And you need to get a little higher If
you feel like you need a blessing And you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel a little high today Welcome to the
church of Cali High Cali High Cali High
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Cali High Episode 55 I'm your
host Chenzo Nico and this week Cali High
[SPEAKER_02]: joins Brett Feldman of Wonder Brett at the
Wonder Brett facilities in Long Beach for
[SPEAKER_02]: an enlightening interview on the history
of Wonder Brett and the future of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about growing up in the San
Fernando Valley and his early days
[SPEAKER_02]: attending Humboldt State University and
procuring the good herb to bring back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the 818 Brett recalls hanging out with Dre
and Snoop and how he was gifted the
[SPEAKER_02]: original OG Kush which led to such strains
as Orange Sunset and Pink Picasso as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as others The discussion flows to the
preservation of strains how long to keep a
[SPEAKER_02]: mother and what to look for in a male
Brett describes the new five acre farm in
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Barbara and reveals a new line of
Wonder Brett seeds coming soon We also
[SPEAKER_02]: talk artwork and cultural influences
behind this iconic brand Stay tuned
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright Cali High is blessed to be at the
Wonder Brett facilities in the LBC with
[SPEAKER_02]: none other than Wonder Brett himself
Brett, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, how are you today Vince?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thanks for having us down Thanks
for coming Yeah, what a great facility you
[SPEAKER_02]: have I appreciate that, we work really
hard here So tell us a bit of your history
[SPEAKER_02]: of growing and breeding cannabis and the
evolution of the Wonder Brett brand So I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: from the San Fernando Valley, grew up in
Northridge Granada Hills area and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mid 90s there was a lot of good weed
strains that were kind of coming through
[SPEAKER_01]: the valley and a bunch of guys that were
really enthusiasts about trying to collect
[SPEAKER_01]: and find really good genetics we were
seeing like purple haze stuff that would
[SPEAKER_01]: come from either Amsterdam or up north or
like Northern Lights or early train wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that and then I just fell
in love with cannabis the first time I
[SPEAKER_01]: ever smoked it it worked amazing for me I
was diagnosed with ADD and dyslexia so
[SPEAKER_01]: they had me on Dexedrine which is
basically like a Ritlin another version of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and as soon as I smoked weed I was
like oh that's what I need and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things become a lot more clear and easier
for me when it came to school after that
[SPEAKER_01]: which is so like nobody wants their kids
smoking weed when they're going to high
[SPEAKER_01]: school or something like that but it
really helped me through high school and
[SPEAKER_01]: through college in the first few years
that I went to Humboldt for three years
[SPEAKER_01]: and again I went there because I just love
weed so much and wanted to be immersed in
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that are growing the weed and
having the best genetics and these things
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you major in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an art major so it was different
than like there wasn't like there wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like oh everybody's working on a laptop or
it was like you had to sit there and like
[SPEAKER_01]: draw stuff and make designs and turn in
projects that were handmade so I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: missed out on a lot of the digital stuff
it was it wasn't really accessible in the
[SPEAKER_01]: late 90s yeah you know to everybody at
that point wasn't that developed then yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: now 20 years later like everybody's
walking around with like you know pens and
[SPEAKER_01]: pads that they can draw and create all the
artwork they want in the world like
[SPEAKER_01]: animate make a movie if you want like a
cartoon on your iPad basically you know
[SPEAKER_01]: which yeah I could only dream of making a
cartoon at you know at a young age on an
[SPEAKER_02]: iPad that'd be incredible so yeah well
that's cool um you know I read some of
[SPEAKER_02]: your bio on the website and I just had to
ask who gifted you the original OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a circle from Josh D it was his
buddy Ian who lived in the Bay at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I've heard of him actually yeah he's
like a really talented woodworker he's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really talented guy and a great guy nice
guy he was growing the OG when I first got
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced to the original OG Kush cut
which is I say original because there was
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time there was Kush Bubba was
pretty heavy mm-hmm the time yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in LA and Bubba was cool yeah
Bubba was amazing yeah I still miss
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes like you know I see it in some
genetics coming back here and there like
[SPEAKER_01]: you see some breeding and you're like oh
yeah that's definitely got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba in there or something but yeah yeah
so Bubba was really more popular in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning and then I got introduced to OG
Kush like about maybe a year after I got
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced to Bubba right and then so or
Kush Bubba and then when I Pure Kush was
[SPEAKER_01]: just so unique in the original OG Kush
whether what do you call it you know back
[SPEAKER_01]: then was we would it was just Kush or OG
Kush or the Pure Kush PK yeah yeah and so
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to the Bay to get it all the
time and and I just kept clearing out the
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole like supply the whole supply you
know like and so they they just gave me
[SPEAKER_01]: the cut after a while because I like we're
just not enough yeah everybody here so you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to learn how to grow if you want to
keep it and I was that was what really
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked me into high gear it'll be like I
understood what was given to me and how
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing it was it was like the
significance yeah it really was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: game-changing strain you know like I'd
seen tons of great weed and trust me there
[SPEAKER_01]: was tons of great weed and humble all
those strains like the Northern Lights and
[SPEAKER_01]: Trainwrecks and Kalio and the original
skunk and you know there was a Bluebeard
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah the original Blueberry was is amazing
I still miss it yeah the closest thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to that in our arsenal is the the
Beyond Blueberry mm-hmm and then now also
[SPEAKER_01]: the Blueberry Purps is yes the strain
right here in the blue box so cool those
[SPEAKER_01]: strains are the over years and years are
like the only thing I've ever come close
[SPEAKER_01]: to to seeing that have like the that true
Blueberry Turpene where you're like wow
[SPEAKER_01]: that smells like a candied Blueberry from
some sort of you know mm-hmm you know kids
[SPEAKER_02]: kids profile have you ever tasted the
Humboldt Seed Company Blueberry Muffin
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I've had that yeah yeah that's also
has some Blueberry going for it for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that's definitely a very a very good one
as well Humboldt Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: those are good guys up there they do good
work yeah a buddy of mine does a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work with them we just interviewed Nat
yeah yeah buddy of mine cannabis Corey
[SPEAKER_01]: who's a seed breeder for a long time and
and he did a lot of work for DNA genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: early on to works with those guys and a
bunch of people and we're actually doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed project with him which is I guess I
can talk about I haven't really talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about it but we do have a seed line coming
in this year oh wow that was one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: questions yeah I was like should I talk
about that I haven't really announced that
[SPEAKER_02]: yet but I guess it'll be like the this is
a scoop a Cali High scoop folks you heard
[SPEAKER_02]: it here first you guys got the Wonderbret
seeds and what genetics are you putting
[SPEAKER_01]: into those seeds the first route well that
I'll leave as a surprise okay that I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: leave as a surprise yeah but yeah we got
some stuff coming though yeah so and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't help but ask what's the story behind
Dre and Snoop smoking your bud it's
[SPEAKER_01]: because really because of exhibit because
I met exhibit and was a fan of his music
[SPEAKER_01]: and I started giving him OG Kush that I
was when I started growing it in about
[SPEAKER_01]: like 90 late 98 99 is probably right when
I met him because they were working on the
[SPEAKER_01]: the chronic 2001 album at that point he
was working on saw songs that he had
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out exhibit had coming out the song
called year 2000 with Dr. Dre that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the like singles that led up to a
lot of like you know exhibits yeah bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: successes right how cool so by meeting
exhibit he brought me into that circle and
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was able to like go to you know
video shoots where they're you know
[SPEAKER_01]: filming the next episode and like all
these like historic videos at what at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time I knew I was blessed to be at those
places yeah but I hadn't when you're there
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like this music's amazing you know
like yeah this is great and like but you
[SPEAKER_01]: had no idea that the like phenomena that
was cultural significance yeah that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna turn into oh yeah did you see the
halftime at the Super Bowl oh yeah of
[SPEAKER_01]: course oh my god yeah it was really cool
to to see it like it's so crazy because
[SPEAKER_01]: now we're the older group right like so
you're still pretty young yeah you know
[SPEAKER_01]: but my daughter you know like I have a 15
year old daughter and she's like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: she listens to these songs now and it's
like to her like we're listening to oldies
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you know like oldies when I was a kid
we were listening to like Otis Redding
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and like stuff I'd be like come on
dad like I can't listen to any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know bebop you know songs like I
could deal with the R&B and all this other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff but these ones where there was like
these early 50s like you know doo-wop
[SPEAKER_01]: songs I was like yeah they killing me so
yeah well I kind of grew up with some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those yeah so can you tell the Collie High
listeners the genetics behind some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite Wonderbit flavors yeah for sure
I'm fully interested in because I had like
[SPEAKER_02]: a like a maybe a life-changing moment with
your orange sunset so yeah that strain is
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of our you know it's one of our
best like that's the hard part is people
[SPEAKER_01]: always ask me what's your favorite strain
of all the strains you have and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really like you know it's like what's your
favorite strain that day really or what
[SPEAKER_01]: your favorite strain that week what do you
you know you cuz yeah it can't be almost
[SPEAKER_01]: the same strain and that's why I don't
really you know grow OG as much as it more
[SPEAKER_01]: as we yeah I grew OG for 15 years straight
before anybody would accept another strain
[SPEAKER_01]: and thank God for dispensaries yep opening
up and creating the medical market and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the rec market because it finally led
to like us to be able to grow a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors that we wanted to grow but we just
couldn't because no one wanted those
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors at the time as soon as the
dispensaries opened up all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: they were like hey you have any sativas
you're like I have some flavors for you
[SPEAKER_01]: mm-hmm you know and we were just based on
off a flavor all the time and smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and and just good smooth you
know tasty weed yeah well wonder bread
[SPEAKER_02]: buds are some of the most unique flavors
now I appreciate that I've experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and I'm not just stroking you we try
hard yeah we like that we want the part to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak for itself and we have a lot of you
know strong cult following so we see that
[SPEAKER_01]: it is there are you know people that
gravitate to it we know that we're one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the top five brands in California right
now and it's a it everybody's it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: subjective right like everybody's got
their own so where did the orange sunset
[SPEAKER_01]: come from is it tangy in there yeah so
let's see it came from the orange banana
[SPEAKER_01]: which came from banana split right so
which banana split came from Crockett
[SPEAKER_01]: before Crockett teamed up with DNA he he
was he was really known for tangy at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time like right before he before DNA they
clicked up and then they went and did a
[SPEAKER_01]: big seed thing together so I went to
Emerald Cup looking for Crockett and his
[SPEAKER_01]: daughter which they were sharing a booth
in this little tiny booth at the time he
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't a big name but if you were in the
right circle you kind of knew who to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow yeah yeah and he was one of these
people that was like he's definitely has
[SPEAKER_01]: some good genetics and some unique flavors
so I bought these seeds from him called
[SPEAKER_01]: banana split which was banana og crossed
with sherb and tangy oh wow so when I
[SPEAKER_01]: popped that seeds we got these very
extremely floral banana like like
[SPEAKER_01]: obnoxious banana smell where you're like
it's almost when you smelt it you're like
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of makes me feel sick yeah yeah
I'm not a big fan of strawberry banana
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's the only strain now that I
taste banana and yeah yeah so I like
[SPEAKER_01]: banana strains but yeah this strain was it
had this floral banana to it where it
[SPEAKER_01]: almost reminds you of like that when you
were in the dentist chair as a kid and
[SPEAKER_01]: they put that but that flavor in your
mouth for the fluoride or whatever it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like that right where you were like this
is this is funky it didn't taste like
[SPEAKER_01]: banana at all though when you smoked it it
smelled like banana but it tastes like
[SPEAKER_01]: tangy yeah it was the oddest thing it was
one of the it's probably one of the only
[SPEAKER_01]: times I've ever smoked a strain still to
date where the terpene profile that you
[SPEAKER_01]: smell did not match the flavor in any way
that's kind of odd yeah yeah like I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to say there's extremely orange tangy but
there's banana smell mm-hmm so we crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: the pineapple og which is a strain that we
made prior to right the the banana split
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so the pineapple og is right here
yeah and that's like the first strain that
[SPEAKER_01]: I created when I was breeding when I got
og early on and a buddy of mine from
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt gave me the sour grape seeds and
like I was hoping to try and make a grape
[SPEAKER_01]: og but it just didn't come out great but
all this came out like this super gassy
[SPEAKER_01]: pineapple and so we took that banana split
when we were doing that I had the male
[SPEAKER_01]: from the banana split and I crossed that
into the pineapple og making orange banana
[SPEAKER_01]: right because that was version one of
orange banana and that was out I'd say
[SPEAKER_01]: like in 2014 or 2015 when we were just
right in the middle of like the transition
[SPEAKER_01]: from medical to rec right well rec wasn't
even around actually till 2018 the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation was happening really but so
that was happening and then then skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: came around right and we were everybody
was excited about skittles and then dying
[SPEAKER_01]: breed put out the skittles og cross which
is the OZK right and that was at this they
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped the seeds at this high times event
was a double weekend it was crazy like so
[SPEAKER_01]: went to go buy those seeds from them when
they were setting up but they were super
[SPEAKER_01]: busy they was like I'll hit me back later
I'll come you know set aside for you this
[SPEAKER_01]: and that meanwhile I was like okay well
we'll catch up with them I never caught up
[SPEAKER_01]: with them that weekend and or that that
day actually was the first day the event I
[SPEAKER_01]: was trying to get him that day but our
booth was slammed like mm-hmm we were it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like a really good you know week
weekend for us on that one right so we
[SPEAKER_01]: were slammed and I never got back over to
the booth because they were still setting
[SPEAKER_01]: up and they were busy too that night
though their trailer with all their stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: got broken to at the hotel and all of
their seed stock and everything got stolen
[SPEAKER_01]: before I got to get the seeds lucky enough
a friend of mine about a month later he
[SPEAKER_01]: had actually got a pack or two of the
seeds the night before everything got
[SPEAKER_01]: stolen when they were at the hotel hanging
out yeah I guess these guys they had some
[SPEAKER_01]: of them in their backpacks or whatever my
buddy was able to get two packs of them
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was able I was just talking about
how I was so bummed that I couldn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds and he was like wait a second
I think I have those seeds at my house
[SPEAKER_01]: like the OZK like he's like those are my
kitchen drawer right now let's go there
[SPEAKER_01]: like let's go to your house again we went
and got him he gave me the seeds and and
[SPEAKER_01]: so destiny eventually gave me those seeds
we got those seeds would pop them we came
[SPEAKER_01]: out with some really good OZK two great
Finos we've only released one of the Finos
[SPEAKER_01]: to date you did have an OZK didn't you
yeah we still have it we did that
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration with be real yeah we gave
him the OZK because back when OG was
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up like I gave him that cut early
on too and he rapped about it in his Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green thumb song and he really blew up
Kush on the map like that's what really
[SPEAKER_01]: blew Kush up all the way was be real he
deserves all of the credit in the sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: creating Kush into this like pop icon
legend yeah strain and then everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to smoke it and so it was big for
years after that right Cypress Hills yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely like my idols when it comes to
music them and Rage Against Machine which
[SPEAKER_01]: he ended up becoming the front man for
Rage Against Machine for a while which was
[SPEAKER_01]: super fun cool to see that happen but I
gave him that strain because he blew up OG
[SPEAKER_01]: so we did the collab was only made sense
to give him OZ and do the collab because
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush and Skittles were such iconic
strains it's like if anybody's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to promote this strain properly and
give the world a good look at it it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be him so people love our OZK and
but that OZK also harvested a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: male out of it I know this is a big circle
to turn around on so right that's how we
[SPEAKER_01]: get back to Orange Sunset right yeah the
male from the OZK into the original Orange
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana right gives you Orange Sunset oh
wow well thank you for that so that is
[SPEAKER_01]: cool that's how much work goes into our
genetics a lot of stuff you know like yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: summer determination even more complex
like the the blueberry perps is an even
[SPEAKER_01]: longer breeding process to get to that one
so yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: are your concentrates made from exclusive
excuse me are your concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively made from your strains yes
only our all our concentrates are made
[SPEAKER_01]: from our genetics we don't outsource yeah
yeah yeah that's cool they taste like it
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah everything up till right now actually
it's it's your timing is impeccable on the
[SPEAKER_01]: question because up until today or like
the last week or two right everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you've tasted concentrate wise has come
from our Long Beach facility growing here
[SPEAKER_01]: right yeah yeah we did a deal with a Santa
Barbara farm that's another one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: questions so we did this big outdoor farm
last year and we froze everything from the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest in October of last year it's all
in the freezer been processing it to put
[SPEAKER_01]: out the vape line how many acres it was
five acres five acres yeah we went how
[SPEAKER_01]: many plants is five acres hold 15,000
plants well so we all from clones yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you know from from you know from
starts so you can now take your
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates from the outdoor and that's
what we're using for our vape line right
[SPEAKER_01]: so the whole vape line right now it is is
our genetics but grown at yeah our partner
[SPEAKER_01]: farm that was a whole question in there
yeah so we've covered all types of bases
[SPEAKER_02]: yep yep yep well that's interesting I
figured because I noticed you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: an outdoor flower from no from the Santa
Barbara farm no and that's the thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's always people on Instagram
they're like yeah always crazy comments
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah the outdoor is for concentrates
and for a good reason so that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: give you guys a very affordable vape and
not be charging you know you know fifty
[SPEAKER_01]: sixty dollars for a half a gram it on some
for high quality vapes because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: it would cost if you were using the indoor
flower right and it just becomes too
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive yeah especially in this day of
over taxation yeah that's a whole other
[SPEAKER_02]: topic yeah yeah yeah yeah so how many
strains do you have I counted 13 but I
[SPEAKER_02]: think I saw more multicolored boxes than
13 yeah there are there more than 13
[SPEAKER_01]: there's closer to like 20 some come in and
out over the time periods like certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strains like orange dynamite stick that we
did with sublime that was like one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: very first like celebrity collaborations
we did with them and that we haven't grown
[SPEAKER_01]: that and I'd say at least four years oh
well you know we could bring it back at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point but all the time we're
constantly breeding and creating new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains and how do you like keep a strain
around for like some of your strains have
[SPEAKER_02]: been around for many years so how do you
keep that strain that strains genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: from getting weak and changing it comes
through good plant health by maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: good plant health all the time you know
the clone that you cut from that mom it's
[SPEAKER_01]: only gonna be as good as the health of
that mom right and so if you're not good
[SPEAKER_01]: at maintaining the health of your plants
and creating a very vigorous plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: when you go to cut clones you're gonna
keep diminishing in health over time so
[SPEAKER_01]: mm-hmm that's how we've maintained our our
strength of our genetics this this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: original pineapple OG cut like from I'd
say 2006 you know it's so vigorous it's
[SPEAKER_02]: one of our our best it's so you've had a
mother ever since then healthy mother no
[SPEAKER_01]: we we don't hold on to culture or no I I
don't really subscribe to holding on to
[SPEAKER_01]: moms like that that used to be I think
some old-world stuff we were like just
[SPEAKER_01]: keep going yeah like new moms yeah you
just keep creating the next version of a
[SPEAKER_01]: really healthy mom yeah yeah basically we
believe that you know for all your growers
[SPEAKER_01]: out there like a mom that 's older than 90
days is is not worth keeping okay you
[SPEAKER_01]: heard it here folks you know I had OG moms
that I had literally for like eight nine
[SPEAKER_01]: years before I gave them up but yeah only
because of the realization that like I was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting much better clone stock off of the
new cuttings off the new cutting yeah and
[SPEAKER_01]: just constantly like always Fino hunting
within your genetic yeah right yeah the
[SPEAKER_01]: best healthiest mom there absolutely that
to the to your to your veg space and clone
[SPEAKER_01]: from there and keep always looking for the
clones that root first and have the
[SPEAKER_01]: healthiest vigorous take off and keep
building the health up instead of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: going I'm gonna keep that one and put it
into bloom because that's gonna give me a
[SPEAKER_01]: four ounce plant yeah you know like try to
get all your plants to be four ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because of that mom you know
exactly it's just a lot of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: learning curves that a lot of people just
they have to learn for themselves yeah how
[SPEAKER_02]: many years have you been growing just out
of curiosity you know I'd say the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time I threw seeds in the backyard I was
like in you know 10th grade you know like
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah but first time I really started
growing was when OG Kush was given to me
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah 97 97 98 like somewhere right there
because yeah I graduated 96 for high
[SPEAKER_01]: school I was going up and down for college
and then yeah 24 years yeah so it's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been a long time and more than half
my life I've been been indoor growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: and now we've been doing the some of the
outdoor stuff too we don't have as big of
[SPEAKER_01]: a hand in that on a daily basis we are
there weekly and checking in on everything
[SPEAKER_01]: but we really rely on people that are are
good at their craft that if someone's been
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in the outdoor for 10 15 years and
I've been growing an indoor yeah for 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years yeah I'm gonna respect yeah you know
and what there's a lot of stuff crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: over it's pretty simple yeah outdoor
growing is really about your climate and
[SPEAKER_01]: just like doing certain preparations and
then kind of letting it all go and finish
[SPEAKER_02]: you know yeah it's the beauty of outdoor
so yeah I'm on my fifth year in my
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard I've learned so much in five
years because I've interviewed people like
[SPEAKER_02]: you and other growers that have given me
great information it's simpler than it is
[SPEAKER_01]: right I mean people make it so complex and
you're just like it's less is more with
[SPEAKER_02]: this yeah it's a labor of love too yeah
any CBD high strains not yet we do plan on
[SPEAKER_01]: putting out some some CBD breeding
projects soon like one of the goals is to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed our genetics into CBD over and over
again and to create a basically a Wonder
[SPEAKER_01]: Brett menu of our flavors but in a CBD
flower CBD so that you can have it be
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually you know yeah everywhere
instead of just where we're limited to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis like yes you know if you were
stranded on the desert island with three
[SPEAKER_02]: of your strains would you want to have
today because I know it changes right so I
[SPEAKER_01]: would definitely say you know pink
Picasso's gonna be there just one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites it's such a unique strain it's
just beautiful flavor and there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: else it tastes like that I would say wow
that second one I have to say probably
[SPEAKER_01]: orange sunset or orange banana you know
like because orange bananas the new the
[SPEAKER_01]: new version is a version two which is the
OZK cookies and cream crossed into the
[SPEAKER_01]: original orange banana so it's a little
bit different than the orange sunset but
[SPEAKER_01]: orange sunset just tastes like it's hard
to have two oranges on the menu let me
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you right now like people are like
why you have two orange trees on the menu
[SPEAKER_01]: because both those strains are so unique
yeah yeah one is they're different from
[SPEAKER_01]: each other yeah one is is like straight
orange crushed soda and one is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: this orange banana yeah different highs
and within that same terpene profile so
[SPEAKER_02]: mm-hmm and then you know I wanted to ask
what's behind pink Picasso because yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: that's again you know that the beautiful
male that came from OZK that we got that
[SPEAKER_01]: made that same one that made the orange
headset yeah and even a lot of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics like yeah well we find a good
male we cross that male into every thing
[SPEAKER_01]: we have in our stable of all of our
already and how do you find a good male do
[SPEAKER_01]: you rub the stem yeah definitely like you
look for vigor you look for structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also like if you can smell a strong
terpene profile in veg on the nail before
[SPEAKER_01]: it even goes in bloom exactly and some
people just don't have the nose to like
[SPEAKER_01]: detect those things fortunately I pity
them yeah some people just don't they just
[SPEAKER_01]: they just smell they just smell green you
know or a plant my good friend used to go
[SPEAKER_02]: up to up Humboldt and get some weed from
this lady up there in the mountains and
[SPEAKER_02]: she always said to pick your males by the
smell the fragrance yeah totally yeah why
[SPEAKER_01]: Long Beach bro Long Beach is a great city
they were really accommodating they were
[SPEAKER_01]: first movers and being first into the
marketplace mm-hmm is key when especially
[SPEAKER_01]: a place is as competitive of California
yeah yeah like there we were never a
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily funded company that had you know
some big Canadian backers or right you
[SPEAKER_01]: know billionaires that supported us right
we raised very little money to start this
[SPEAKER_01]: company and we've always been very scrappy
all our partnerships are our good
[SPEAKER_01]: partnerships and that's how we've got to
where we are is like without having to do
[SPEAKER_01]: all that right so Long Beach you know
again they did that the licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: processes were good here the taxes are
good here the city is good to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: and the people are great in Long Beach and
and mm-hmm you know yeah yeah would I have
[SPEAKER_01]: loved to have it right and you know yeah
you know not as much that's worth or
[SPEAKER_01]: something is LA that's for sure yeah but
you know I live up in this I still live up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the San Fernando Valley and yeah I
drive down here an hour hour and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: hour every day I would have loved to have
been you know right you know somewhere off
[SPEAKER_01]: of Rosita or something you know like but
you know this is the time you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: have you had two choices it was either go
to the desert or find a city like this and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is an amazing place to work so long
which is it's great well that's cool this
[SPEAKER_02]: is a big organization you must have many
teams in various areas of responsibility
[SPEAKER_01]: what is your management structure like we
are I swear that questions you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that is one of the biggest
misconceptions about this brand is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: are this big team and like honestly if you
look around these office right here there
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a big office but really there's only
like our CPA our CEO Matt Costa two
[SPEAKER_01]: graphic designers one one lead marketing
guy you know another head of R&D with me
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah there's about six seven guys
that really run this brand my partner
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameron he is in Michigan right now
running the operations and the grow out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and you're going multi-state is what
yeah we're in two states now and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be hopefully I can't announce it yet
but okay two more states hopefully by the
[SPEAKER_01]: by the end of this year so indoor and
outdoor facilities mostly indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities a start and then retail
hopefully some retail as well in those
[SPEAKER_01]: states as well that is part of our plan is
to to roll out into states with indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor to support the vape line because
the vape line is people really love the
[SPEAKER_01]: vape we just launched that and it's it's
done way better than than we expected out
[SPEAKER_01]: the gate is it a live resin kind of thing
yeah it's all live resin 100% you know
[SPEAKER_01]: just we make this is how we do it so we
freeze everything from the field we crash
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a sauce where we get diamonds and
turps we separate the diamonds and turps
[SPEAKER_01]: we melt the diamonds reintroduce the turps
so it's a hundred percent the plant we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't put any additives in there there's
no natural turpines which are not natural
[SPEAKER_02]: like right they're not cannabis
non-cannabis you're not supposed to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: oranges and lemon cleaner and all of these
things like you're supposed to smoke you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to smoke cannabis smoke cannabis so
I'm not a big fan of what I consider fake
[SPEAKER_01]: turps but they call natural turps there's
a lot of like joints out there that have
[SPEAKER_01]: fake turps of them and and you know yeah
it's not a big fan I swear I'm like why
[SPEAKER_01]: would you do that yeah it's not a
guarantee it's not coming from somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who really loves to smoke that designed
that product right they designed it to
[SPEAKER_01]: make money and then they designed and they
got a lot of people introduced to it and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just what they used to and they're
not really having an A to B comparison now
[SPEAKER_01]: they do with my product out there yeah or
the Wonder Brett brand product out there
[SPEAKER_01]: with these with these vapes now you
actually can taste what our flowers taste
[SPEAKER_01]: like as if they were a dab right so a lot
of this is where I think that the light
[SPEAKER_01]: bulb goes off for a lot of people when
they smoke our vape right right and the
[SPEAKER_01]: live resin it triggers in their mind but
so many people who've taken dabs have
[SPEAKER_01]: already experienced this huge flavor jump
mm-hmm right when you went from smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter or something like that to smoking
libraries and dabs we experienced this
[SPEAKER_01]: jump in flavor that was probably the the
biggest jump in cannabis flavor that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could think of ever in like a quality like
that so Callie Hi is back with Wonder
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett Brett Feldman you'll mind me yeah
that's fine away your last name okay I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the open here I got licenses in my
name a social equity applicant there you
[SPEAKER_02]: go bro there's no going back mm-hmm so we
already talked about Santa Barbara and did
[SPEAKER_02]: it did it oh what kind of I mean if you
don't mind me asking the growing indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: growing facilities lighting are you LED
now or we do a mix we've been doing a mix
[SPEAKER_01]: of LED and in HPS for probably like eight
years mm-hmm right when LEDs like just
[SPEAKER_01]: started to have any show of life mm-hmm a
friend of ours had bought a bunch of him
[SPEAKER_01]: and he didn't like him he was gonna throw
him away and I was like just give it to me
[SPEAKER_01]: and he gave him to me and I put him up in
between our we made checkerboard lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it and we saw a really good benefit
yeah so it was like from that point on LED
[SPEAKER_01]: was viable to me and over the years just
gotten better and better and better yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so give you the lights yeah all of
them you know whoever you pick yeah so we
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about keeping your strains stable
over the years and my question was gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be have you ever grown from seed we know
you have and then now we know that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be seeds coming yeah the seed
line I'm excited about that I think a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people I'm gonna be really happy with
what we put out we're not holding back we
[SPEAKER_01]: are we're not holding it we're not putting
on everything at once are they gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized no no they'll be regular seeds
yeah can get males yeah so people could be
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders too it's like yeah we've had our
fun with these strains and and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: them out over the years and we have so
much stuff that we haven't even been able
[SPEAKER_01]: to put out yeah that it's like I just feel
guilty holding on to certain things this
[SPEAKER_01]: long and not giving them out to the world
that's a noble endeavor well I just there
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be the next you know generation
of people that that run with these and
[SPEAKER_01]: take them into different places that like
I can't do everything our team can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything Apple leaving their source code
yeah public or like Tesla or something
[SPEAKER_01]: doing you know but they gave out a lot of
their their battery technology to Toyota
[SPEAKER_02]: or the GM or whoever they did mm-hmm so
where you have a retail outlet here in LA
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you yeah so we opened up our store
last year in July first Wonder Brett store
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll open up another Wonder Brett
store this year another one in LA and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just keep going one by one and some
certain areas we don't want to have too
[SPEAKER_01]: big of a retail footprint mm-hmm it
becomes a whole other side of the business
[SPEAKER_01]: right yeah the retail so we just want to
have I think maybe four or five stores in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain areas so that we can service our
our clientele with a our experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: we like it's you know if you exclusively
carry your own products or no no we carry
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of other brands in there and we
just carry what we think like what we
[SPEAKER_01]: would smoke if we weren't around yeah and
it's tough being in our store it's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people come to our store to get Wonder
Brett product but also there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: other people that know that we do curate a
good menu and and we bring in other good
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that people like are really
desirable like you know guys like Redline
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics or Doja or the Association
balanced or I like balanced you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff with we just did a really cool
collab with Lyft tickets for this
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliance worth our flower where they
they put a THC diamond on it so it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: a it's our it's our concentrate to right
with it too so it's extreme specific but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like the first time I've seen anybody
do a really really good like a high-end
[SPEAKER_01]: version of like what I would consider like
a infused flower or moon rock you know
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that where it's not like
rolled and distillate and dirty old key
[SPEAKER_01]: what is that you know like as soon as
somebody hits you hit it you're like I
[SPEAKER_01]: have an instant headache you know you're
like yeah please never give me that again
[SPEAKER_01]: but when you do it really nice with with
our products it's it's a it's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: product I was blown away on how good it
was so uh-huh shout out to to Emmett there
[SPEAKER_02]: the ticket okay did I see you speaking at
a rally the other day it was against the
[SPEAKER_02]: tax yeah yeah we the cannabis industry is
facing right now yeah the taxes are crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: a good friend from his name is Elliot from
catalyst he's the owner of those
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and he he has a lot of he has
a lot of just experience and knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of like how all of this
stuff's happening with the taxes and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: in it whereas like the past year two or
even further back I just been so focused
[SPEAKER_01]: with head down on the brand always because
it's it is a lot of work to maintain and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep this operation running you know from
yeah whether it's the cultivation side or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's the brand side or you know
internal stuff you know it's like I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a weed guy I didn't grow up in some
business structure world where I knew how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do all this stuff so we're you know a
scrappy group and we get it done though
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and I think we have a great team of
people and but the taxes you know with
[SPEAKER_01]: with Elliot he's out there pushing really
hard with the city to try and get stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: changed and so he invited me to come out
and speak at the at the City Hall there
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah because we're you know we're big
taxpayers here in Long Beach as well we we
[SPEAKER_01]: love the city and we're we feel privileged
to be here but this they're not all of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's on the city a lot of it's state taxes
when it comes to excise tax mm-hmm and
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to cultivation tax right
yeah so the cultivation tax you know is
[SPEAKER_01]: $150 a pound which is doesn't seem like
crazy at first but when you look at every
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis comes down that doesn't change
yeah well it's not even just that like
[SPEAKER_01]: that part it's there the five other things
that they tax you for maybe you add it all
[SPEAKER_01]: up that you go wait a second like
individually this isn't so terrible but
[SPEAKER_01]: when you add all of the how many times
cannabis gets taxed it ends up being 37%
[SPEAKER_01]: at the consumer level at the store it all
gets passed down to the consumer and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why a $50 eighth cost 70 when you
walk out the door yeah and that's killing
[SPEAKER_01]: brands it's it's beyond that this is that
this is the nuances that people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand right so there's no tax
write-offs for cannabis brands right right
[SPEAKER_01]: no federal tax yes period exactly so after
you get super taxed you know through the
[SPEAKER_01]: system of the state here then you have
regular income tax right right and then
[SPEAKER_01]: right after that they hit you with 280e
which is an 80% tax from the government
[SPEAKER_01]: for because it's not federally legal so
there's just literally nothing left really
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah 280 you know what to you ever heard
no I've never heard of 280 the 280 is like
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest thing in cannabis that needs a
change and that's why I like federally
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization when that happens 280e will
go away right right and you'll actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to turn a profit and maybe have a tax
write-off and this and that so with all
[SPEAKER_01]: that being said right the the key part of
this that people don't understand is that
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the cannabis gets brought to the
store on terms it's not a COD market right
[SPEAKER_01]: so as soon as that cannabis hits the
market right and goes into a store into
[SPEAKER_01]: the metric system we have to pay that tax
regardless of whether we ever get paid on
[SPEAKER_01]: that pound or not yeah so there are times
where stores don't pay us for pounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: products and stuff like that and then we
still have to pay this hundred fifty
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar tax on that pound that we never
even were able we put in hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars to create that pound and you know
thousands you know like to create that
[SPEAKER_01]: pound really with packaging and distro and
all these things and you just take this
[SPEAKER_01]: huge loss so when you look at the metric
of it you go okay so every one pound that
[SPEAKER_01]: we get stiffed on erases 25 pounds of
profit from another one right or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like this right yeah and it is crazy no
other business is taxed this way not yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: not even the ones that you think not
tobacco not alcohol like like no one is
[SPEAKER_02]: taxed this way and no other agricultural
product has a cultivation tax yeah so the
[SPEAKER_01]: most ag products get subsidies because
they're farms we get no help right we get
[SPEAKER_01]: actually penalized every step of the way
and if there was a way for us to make any
[SPEAKER_01]: money they found another roadblock to
throw up in front of it to put another tax
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of it that's why there's five taxes
on the situation before you actually get
[SPEAKER_01]: to the store yeah right so it's really
sick yeah we are you know fortunate enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to survive right now is and
that is like I think if you interview
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody in cannabis right now they'll tell
you the same thing that is like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what winning is in cannabis right now is
actually surviving yeah right so they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to change that tax code California has a
you know I don't know it's billions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars of surplus right now of money and
for whatever reason they've decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: create the system that is completely
counterproductive to what everybody wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: in California we voted for it to become
legal so people would be going to jail for
[SPEAKER_01]: weed or weed related situations or petty
petty weed related crimes right mm-hmm and
[SPEAKER_01]: to create a safe access for medical and
recreational as well so you wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: black market products and people getting
sick right but when you overtax it this
[SPEAKER_01]: way you give the black market a 40 to 50
percent price advantage where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're thriving and we're we're dying
right oh yeah so it's completely
[SPEAKER_01]: competitive counterproductive to it so
what's gonna happen is a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that had plans to be in this recreational
market have gone out of business and what
[SPEAKER_01]: are those people gonna do they're gonna go
back to the black market and to go sell
[SPEAKER_01]: weed again and there's gonna be a whole
nother resurgence of the war on drugs on
[SPEAKER_01]: some level which is just completely again
the opposite of what we were trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: create it almost seems like they tried to
make it to fail well they made it they
[SPEAKER_01]: made it so that everybody who was a
dreamer with small mom-and-pop money who
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't some big federal company with
billions of dollars would get into it
[SPEAKER_01]: right as well and drain themselves in the
system and we would build the
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure we would build the customer
base we would build the whole system for
[SPEAKER_02]: them and the big MSOs would come in and
clean us out for pennies on the dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: which is I guarantee I would bet my life
that after federal legalization comes in
[SPEAKER_01]: that miraculously taxes will come down
dramatically on cannabis because of their
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying power yeah right now I'm sure
they're lobbying lobbying to kill us along
[SPEAKER_01]: the way so that we none of us can get to
be really a big enough brand that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: a nationwide you know we're that's the
thing they don't understand is they trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to kill us with all this but cannabis guys
are just relentless they don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how like we we're just not going to quit
like no matter what they try to throw at
[SPEAKER_01]: us yeah right so even if we're dying along
the way we're like just we're gonna beat
[SPEAKER_01]: you one way or another no matter how many
roadblocks you put in front of us yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: well I like that determination bro so last
question what advice would you give to
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody that was trying to get into the
cannabis business now be really good at
[SPEAKER_01]: raising money uh-huh you know it's not
getting cheaper now every day this is as
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap as it's ever gonna get right now at
this moment right two years ago was
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper ten years ago ten years from now
to be ten times more yeah it's just it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: race to establish until maybe like you say
federal legalization federal legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: comes it's gonna be a floodgate of
billions of dollars and yeah I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not fair right now wait till they break
out the Amazon model where they're like we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't care we could lose money for the
next five years just to put all of you out
[SPEAKER_01]: of business and then when all you are to
business then we'll start ratcheting the
[SPEAKER_01]: price up slowly mm-hmm yeah and that's how
guys with billions of dollars get to have
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of billions of dollars yeah
because it's just they're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about how it affects everybody
they're just thinking about like they
[SPEAKER_01]: found a cheat code that works at a
big-time level and they can keep
[SPEAKER_01]: exploiting it because they have the big
bankroll yeah well so if you want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into cannabis raise money or find a niche
like yeah a really small niche that that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can protect and that you know it's not
worth it for the big guys to try and come
[SPEAKER_02]: take it from you yeah yeah I have actually
one more question go ahead artistic
[SPEAKER_02]: influences I know that I would say the
packaging of Wonder Bread is probably tops
[SPEAKER_02]: in the line tops and cannabis right I
appreciate that in my opinion so yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: know definitely very influenced by music
and art and TV and film like anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: just evokes strong emotion and visually
you know pleasing is something that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: always been gravitated to so it's yeah you
know Picasso and Van Gogh and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: mm-hmm you know the new stuff like you
know Keith Haring and you know Jeff Koons
[SPEAKER_01]: and just there's so many if you haven't
