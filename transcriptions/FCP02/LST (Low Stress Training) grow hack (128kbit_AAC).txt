[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody, this is Chad Westport and
I just wanted to pop in here and show you
[SPEAKER_00]: a really quick grow hack.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't have trellis to kind of
spread out your plant or the branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow hack I'm showing you today is
binder clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant is getting ready for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, I've done a pretty
good job of spreading out my main
[SPEAKER_00]: terminals to produce more colas than if I
just let this grow in the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of how I help spread that out is
through the use of these twist ties and my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow hack of binder clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, after about a week or
two of being held in the new position by
[SPEAKER_00]: the twist ties and the binder clips,
the branches will take that form or keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that shape when you remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this skunk number one plant is going to
have the twist ties removed before I put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this Temple Runts plant, I've already
removed the twist ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, here and here,
it held its shape from when it was bound
[SPEAKER_00]: and tied down, which allowed these to grow
up around it and these to fill out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more colas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the way I use my binder clips
and spread this Temple Runts out,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see, there's now plenty of tops
on the plant and it's all because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real quick, let me recreate the binder
clips on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever size of pot you're using,
they have a binder clip for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got large.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got medium and they've got small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also works on fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cinches, it grips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just show you real quick what I
did here to train this plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took my medium clip, put it right
there on the edge of my planter,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab my twist tie, put it in, twist it
out, bring it up, grab my branch and hold
[SPEAKER_00]: it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want, you can progressively
kind of tighten this and bring your branch
[SPEAKER_00]: lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't want to do it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to snap the branch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of slowly, progressively
just keep bringing it down and laying your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the end result of that training is a
lot more terminal shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in a tight space, so the more I
have, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've achieved this through my binder
clip grow hack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fellas, ladies, please let us know in
the comments section what you're doing to
[SPEAKER_00]: help spread and train your plants when you
don't have a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be interested to hear what you're doing.
