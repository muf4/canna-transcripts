[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a camp for this question that
I've been pondering for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point, at what percentage do the
terpenes become possibly, I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know if it's possible, but like damaging,
you know, to our lungs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we keep searching for these
really high terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's got to be some kind of
numbers on like exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's, that's why I feel like rosin
is so like, I, I bet 10 years from now,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are going to be a lot of lungs that
even though you think it's healthier,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, you're, you're getting that much
high dose of specific, uh, kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning style terpenes in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking about that the last
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, I remember growing
some, uh, Oh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange, uh, orange something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super fucking tur, like dreadfully
terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I smoked it, I was like,
Oh man, my fucking chest hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lungs hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know if it's just that
particular terpene and my, my constitution
[SPEAKER_01]: to it or what it is, but there was
definitely a level terpene toxicity would
[SPEAKER_05]: be a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just curious, like, and if so,
like it's, it must be different for
[SPEAKER_01]: different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like what, no terpene is good for every
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, uh, like, yeah, it would be
different, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like how sensitive I am to stuff
like, uh, linalool, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small amounts of linalool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I can't smoke like lavender
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I take a dab or something,
like I have a dab rig in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like they're dead for like a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Tony said, it might be the waxed
lipids and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I listen to people dab all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their cough is different than somebody
that smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My style, girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Instagram is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Philio Phil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, the Mac and stuff and stuff with
Mac in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it looks like a beautiful,
beautiful plant, but I can't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like cilantro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives, it makes my eyes hurt
immediately after smoking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned that to somebody who gave me
some a while back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also some cultivars immediately when I
smoke them make my eye pain so much worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It increased glaucoma pressure,
this, that and the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them, it's just like,
it's gone as soon as you get near it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it said, there's, they're not all the
same for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not all the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excessive terpene causes excessive lipid,
peroxidation, production and subsequent
[SPEAKER_05]: apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could lead to death.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know, I know with terpenes
there, there is a level, but I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know cannabis terpenes aren't any
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we're going to be able to
grow it to a level that's toxic or like
[SPEAKER_05]: even, I don't know if we can even press it
into that because of how low the level is
[SPEAKER_05]: on the amount that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like limiting on a plant's not going to be
at 4% by itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it's going to be like 2% or less.
[SPEAKER_05]: So concentrate that into a, uh,
like a wax or something like you can do
[SPEAKER_05]: the math.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, if your weed was 20% and now
you're at 90, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You concentrated at five times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So two times five, now you're up to 10%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that level of that terpene toxic to the
human?
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be like the maximum level we're
going to be able to get that to as a
[SPEAKER_05]: singular terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's, is the mixture of those
terpenes worse than a singular level?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if I had all of them at 10,
is that just as bad as one of them as 10?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I feel like this is a valid
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like taking a hit off of, um, like a vape
cartridge, I can tell when they've got
[SPEAKER_05]: fake fucking terps in them and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it, the way it sticks in my mouth,
like we don't do that, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, and it's not cause they're growing
fire weed because they'd be selling it in
[SPEAKER_05]: there, dude, instead of pressing it
completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there ain't no weed in the shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it never, it's never live shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always something that it's either an
isolate that's had that added to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, I don't care if the carts are
live rosin or what they are, but anytime I
[SPEAKER_01]: take a hit of those dabs or, or a cart or
something like that, I get what I call the
[SPEAKER_01]: whooping cough cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it, there's nothing
but with flour and stuff, like the expect,
[SPEAKER_01]: expectorance, expect, however you say
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you actually feel like you're
coughing something up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with the dabs, it's like this hollow,
but like, and then when you try and
[SPEAKER_01]: breathe again, it makes you cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like it cuts my lungs with
something that's standing or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like coating lipids and fats.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked in a candle factory, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You could only work so many hours because
the amount of exposure you'd have the fat
[SPEAKER_05]: lipids in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, you couldn't do overtime after a
certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would literally have to have another
person for the next shift because of those
[SPEAKER_05]: exposures of fats and lipids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could stop breathing and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you're making regular bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you washing those fats and lipids off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, sometimes depending, usually not
like that's where, like when people show
[SPEAKER_05]: their, their, uh, trichome heads,
like real close up, like Jen's Gar,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Jen Doe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jen Doe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Jen, um, she should do static
cleaning, but she showed water hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before too, if you do a high grade,
you're trying to collect that head without
[SPEAKER_05]: disturbing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you don't put a lot of ice in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you want your water cold as
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I like our, our levels of how
we did it changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to just beat the shit out of weed
and do it for too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can take that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where that, that head with a
lot of fats and lipids actually is
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial because it doesn't fall apart
and allow those oils to not quite
[SPEAKER_05]: emulsify, but become part of suspension in
the water where they'd go through your
[SPEAKER_05]: net.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the screens aren't small enough to
catch liquid, like liquid oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then if you're making straight water
hash and you're still retaining those fats
[SPEAKER_01]: and lipids, when you, when you press that,
you're supposed to be getting rid of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fats and lipids and just left with
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you getting rid of the fats and
lipids pressing it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're emulsifying it together with heat
and pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's my view.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're small.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to pass through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you're using a 25 micron,
they're passing through there,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of it actually based on how
greasy it is can like reabsorb back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why doing flower sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they went to doing like cash,
but even with some of that, just quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: keep an eye for the backstage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carry on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who'd you invite?
[SPEAKER_04]: So certain fats and lipids would
definitely be more runny at different
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, if you've got Manteca or
if you've got lard or butter, like they're
[SPEAKER_05]: all fats, but they all act differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like fat in the animal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a type of fat that mounts and
renders real easy and a type of fat
[SPEAKER_05]: that'll stay hard and doesn't want to melt
down as readily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each one of those acts different in
suspension.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though water and oil don't mix,
the fact that you can break it up enough
[SPEAKER_05]: to just end up in the water floating
around is why it'll pass through and you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't catch a lot of your shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to catch heads that are
undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot bacon grease will leak through a
sieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cold bacon grease will stop in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where the cold thing is if you
can keep that head from snapping and
[SPEAKER_05]: breaking off and then shattering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like where they ask about weed
that presses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all that's dependent on, I believe
the fats and lipids that are encasing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they thick enough to keep that from
being disturbed during the process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now when we're smoking this hash make you
cough also hash makes me cough a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more than flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It burns more smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would believe whoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the impromptu.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The impromptu jump on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give everyone context.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guy, co-founder of Papa and Barclay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known him since I love when we first
crossed paths.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like 2016 ish or something
at what was it in San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_02]: San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the topic is something you and I
were talking about and what you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you showing us something?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the topic is you and I in Vegas,
we're talking about like terpenes and like
[SPEAKER_02]: being kind of cleaning agents and the
effect on lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so can you kind of give your thoughts
on on rosin and lungs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because you've changed your perspective
over time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, this is the beauty of an
emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to dig into the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, at Papa and Barclay and
Papa Select our hash brand, we would say
[SPEAKER_00]: best in class, which meant, you know,
the more you know, the better it gets or
[SPEAKER_00]: like if I know better, I do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all have to stay open in our
industry for science to come down and for
[SPEAKER_00]: facts to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is not while we may have been
in the industry like myself for 25 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: been using canvas for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only now that we're really getting
the scientific tools and analysis that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to understand what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we think about terpenes,
OK, naturally occurring terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four percent in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My issue is one, getting away from plant
medicine I'm going to tell you guys right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, I just recently saw Papa and Barclay
and cannabis has been good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on a mission to crush distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here seems old enough to
remember when the clear came out and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all like, oh, the clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all wanted diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all wanted strong THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is drug and prohibition culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure none of us are drinking moonshine
right now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality is the gift of legalization is
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have tasty, delicious things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more, use more, but stronger
is not the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, you have these vape pen
companies out here now using VOCs or
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes to one, make their formula
thinner so that it can work in cartridges
[SPEAKER_00]: and also amplify the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that may present a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to level set smoking and all the
carcinogens associated with that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same level as vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are kind of like digging into the
minutiae, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to put eight plus
percent terpenes in a vape cart,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do have to ask the question,
is that presenting extra carcinogens into
[SPEAKER_00]: the lungs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it better to just have a better
saucing program or better yet work with
[SPEAKER_00]: your Chinese or domestic manufacturer to
find an apparatus that will burn your
[SPEAKER_00]: viscous oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll go on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started, you know, so when we met
actually in 2016, I was just finishing up
[SPEAKER_00]: and still have a company in Colorado that
was a vape company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like everybody else coming out of
prohibition, I wanted to raise to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom over refined cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you met me right when I was meeting my
partner was actually late 2015 at one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these old school high times events with my
partner, Adam, as we were getting ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: start popping Barkley, which is when
luckily I was pulled back into reality of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant medicine first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And solvent list and clean, clean
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that said, this notion that vape carts
have to be the way forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, now that we have puffco devices and
all these electronic vaping devices,
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't we just be understanding that a
nice concentrate and some aroma therapy is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to put any more terpenes in
a good solvent list concentrate for that
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this overtarping of carts, it does
worth saying are terpenes volatile organic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, which they are facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could they get to a level in vape carts
where they become detrimental to our
[SPEAKER_00]: health?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is absolutely yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you, I don't know if you guys
are going to MJ unpacked in a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: here in St. Louis, I'll be talking about
what's on your shelf with Alec Dixon and a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of other retailers talking about
some of the pesticide scares, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: scares that we've had here in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenes may come up, right,
because we need as an industry kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: self regulate because if something goes
wrong, we're on the wrong side of this
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have our P's and Q's up and
people throw around terpenes and re turp
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and add turps willy nilly,
forgetting that these are carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are found in very small
quantities in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we, one, nevermind unnatural
terpenes, you can get way out of pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if they're naturally derived
cannabis, terpenes putting too much in
[SPEAKER_00]: could present a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just my general take on turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to stay facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has different facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm always trying to get educated.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I agree with everything you were
saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel the problem a lot with that,
like you brought up using puffco's and
[SPEAKER_05]: such great idea, but it's hard for us on
the smaller side of this to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: fight big tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's actually the ones pushing the pin.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the ones that want you to rely on
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can sell you in a package repeatedly
with their label on it and replace the
[SPEAKER_05]: product that you're not going to want to
use anymore, which is going to be their
[SPEAKER_05]: tobacco soon as cannabis becomes federal
legal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be able to pick up weed
easier than tobacco and you will switch
[SPEAKER_05]: over and they'll want you to, because of
the price difference and what they can
[SPEAKER_05]: charge you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can charge you double, triple for
cannabis, what they can for tobacco there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll take that away for a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that'll become a novelty where
they can bring me reintroduce it and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you own a smaller scale, but at a more
increased price, they want to corner
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple markets with this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're hooking you right now with the
flavorings they're added.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin talked about that where they're like
adding fruity flavors and such.
[SPEAKER_05]: They brought the menthol flavored part of
cigarette into the pin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a way for you to easily get
hooked to a product because it tastes just
[SPEAKER_05]: like the one they're replacing it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, so I would remind everyone,
and as you guys are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hipping people to cannabis and cannabis
becoming more legal, we are born of
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture and we need to stay
counterculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the terms I used the other day in
Chicago was this notion of compromise to
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need them to legitimize us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not need to look like pharma,
tobacco or alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm not big on the beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, vape pens are about e-cigs and
they were supposed to reduce nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have a teenager that fucking
uses more nicotine than I do when I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost wish she smoked cigarettes at
this point, given the addiction to
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point, we are being gamed as we
always have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the cool things that Alec Dixon
bought up about this panel is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we talk about dirty things in cannabis
and all this testing popping, what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing is they tried to game us by
saying, oh, we need to test cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're finding out, especially
with the value added products like gummies
[SPEAKER_00]: and chocolates and all these other things
that are coming out, is that it's the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the supply chain that's super dirty and
keeps popping and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opportunity here to really
continue our green revolution and show an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of what clean products can be,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not fall into the traps of tobacco
trying to make it convenient for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: to your point, like with menthol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavorings, I am so against
flavors in cannabis, all the way down to
[SPEAKER_00]: gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Papa Select, we were blessed to create
a gummy where the only thing that flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: and colored it was detered pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a strain-specific gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it take TLC to keep those volatile,
TLC meaning tender loving care,
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the VOCs in the hash so that it
stays there and is potent enough to flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: a gummy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I wanted a strawberry gummy,
I would go to the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a strawberry gummy or anything
that's not cannabis-flavored in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, it's like, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get a flavored e-cig anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get flavored gummies anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to taste all the different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke all the different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we should be advocating for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, when we go into our retail
outlets now, they're looking more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: like a CVS, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Distillate-fueled shit, which is just like
Marinol and Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Marinol and Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had distillate products during
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to say it's abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to this notion of Pupcos
and whatnot, I want you all to just vision
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future, to your point, when
cannabis is easier to grow than tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a version of this where we are not
dabbing and holding it and coughing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're putting grams of rosin on hot
plates and letting it just aroma there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just breathe in delicious turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the gift that we should be
advocating for, not this bullshit where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to keep putting taxes on it
because they're like, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you only need a few milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I need thousands of milligrams in the
air all in my face, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be based on how much it costs to
actually grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are out here dying because there's
too much weed in California and Oregon and
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and Colorado, all our mature
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to solve that is to stop holding
on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop trying to do dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop trying to hold in the weed and just
let it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it truly be free and in the air,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think changing some habits and some
cultural things to embrace this gift of
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance is what's needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quickly, show Guy the live rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the right on demand is more of what
they love.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they were never shown carts,
people would love Old World Hash just as
[SPEAKER_05]: much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a quality product that you can't
hide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hide everything in a cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the reason it's in a cart
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live rosin carts, those of you who are
familiar with some manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, if you sauce, which takes time,
there's no real way that I know of to
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly sauce and separate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: your fats, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it a little bit less viscous to
work in the cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a time factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people want to cut corners on
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll add terpenes or sometimes
they'll add MCT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the worst cases, they'll add PG or
some shit like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take enough time, you can sauce
it out to have the viscosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, yes, you have to get a quality
glass cart that has gigantic holes so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can absorb a thicker material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lastly, carts are like the beer can of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will only ever taste so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is you have an oil product that's
going to be reheated multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most carts are in a clear glass cartridge,
therefore exposed to UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that product is completely degrading
from the minute it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a convenience factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to talk quality and
convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carts have a high convenience factor,
which by definition means their quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to be impacted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But do I use carts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I will keep a cart,
especially nowadays where people are all
[SPEAKER_00]: draconian, I'll have to have one taped to
my leg or something when I go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: concert, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're frisking you down nowadays
looking for lighters and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: amusement parks too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go to Great Adventure full of
weed and now they're not, wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't call it Great Adventure here,
they call it Six Flags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pat you down now looking for all your
weed and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, so you got to get the vape
carts all hidden and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vape carts do have their place,
but it's not really in the quality sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know a lot of vape cart,
vape manufacturers, kind of like Bud
[SPEAKER_00]: Light, best-selling beer, want to flex at
all these events because they got the
[SPEAKER_00]: money because they're selling a lot of
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm quick to tell them, you're just
like Bud Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you're making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you have nice market share,
but you will never be quality here at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like he says, like doing all of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: In a cart that gets burned over and over
and over.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like taking all your weed and
rolling it in one giant joint and you
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke it all the time like that till it's
at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first hit was fire, but that last hit
tasted like you're fucking just booting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't low grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you were talking about carts with the
terpenes and added terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think flour will ever, because
everyone's searching for a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage on their flour nowadays as well
because it carries over to their ash and
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we'll ever see that negative
level of terpenes and flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that more terpenes and flour will
affect smoke ability, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that those folks who grow for
hash are growing for terpene content
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's getting lost in the process,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing for hash,
yeah, I think you want to try to get as
[SPEAKER_00]: much breed for terpenes as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing for smoke ability,
which, interestingly enough, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how many people are focused on that these
days, you might not want to have so much
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes because it's going to be harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, you're going to smoke flour
in a way that is not about getting high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but about how smooth it is and how tasty
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And taste is how much is the terpene
content, but too much terpene content
[SPEAKER_00]: tickles the back of your throat and it's
kind of harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too little terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not wow in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that balance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with potency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, everybody's trying to be north
of 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just walking with my wife the other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, one day we're going to go and
there's going to be all different ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be about potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be about taste, terpene content,
and quality of smoke content, and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we're all from, I understand
what happened to the pandemic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these dog walkers and most pre-rolls
sucking through a tiny little hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would ask me, if you ask me now,
when cannabis is legal, I'm going to roll
[SPEAKER_00]: fatties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only pre-roll should be minimum half
inch in size to let more air in so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a fun smoke, just like a cigarette or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like a cigar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smaller than cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so small.
[SPEAKER_05]: You heat up that cherry on it and it kills
all the flavor of the joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a small... And now you can do a
larger grind that'll hold itself instead
[SPEAKER_05]: of a tighter, smaller grind that's just
packed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same reason why they have big cigars
and they're better than a tiny little
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking pack of swisher sweets and shit
like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things taste terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day somebody tried to shoot me
for having a cannabis cigar talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, not all of us can afford a
$50 can of gar and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I'm sorry that I'm in the future,
but it shouldn't be more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's artificially expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out here overgrown, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way of educating consumers is roll
a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop being scared of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers want to sell more weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember that double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people talk about distillate,
that disempowers the farmer and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: never let that happen because the minute
we're growing for biomass or growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of extraction, the farmer's job
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solventless, if you're doing rosin,
the farmer matters because if they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a clean crop, a product that's turpy
with big ash trichomes, you can't get a
[SPEAKER_00]: good extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the farmer doesn't cure their flower
and dry it correctly, it won't smoke well,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we honor our farms and the product
they're creating, we'll get great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way for them not to be backed up
is for us to change our practices around
[SPEAKER_00]: using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly, truly start to use cannabis and
understand that this is an abundant,
[SPEAKER_00]: God-given plant and we held it back
artificially and now that it's unleashed,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's let it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of our practices, stemming from
compliance, unfortunately, are out of
[SPEAKER_00]: scarcity and drug culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little joints, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five little milligrams or vape parts and
all these ways to maximize our milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: where we should, the milligrams will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like alcohol is all standardized,
you're gonna get drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on your way, you're gonna find the
things that taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna look for brands that do it
right, that meet your values.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even having those conversations
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody on this call,
but the majority of money made in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: now is being spent with bad actors who
give a fuck about us, don't care about the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and are just creating products to
give you THC as if you're a drug addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still a lot of work to be done
advocacy-wise and I'm on fire about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quickly, you had a hard stop at 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, thank you for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hand if you'd like to see,
can I give you a homework assignment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you think of some people you'd like to
chop it up with and a topic you'd wanna
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about will go live on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would like to watch that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Show of hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your chance to raise your hand
loud and proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well look, it was nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll send you some topics and some
folks that we can put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about this, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the weirdness here is we have
this kind of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all this misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still trying to hold us back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we cannot give up the mantle of
advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a version of this industry that
is different than tobacco, alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we need to demand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to demand the abundance and the
gifts that this plant wants to give us and
[SPEAKER_00]: not allow folks to force us back into this
form of paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you clap out, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for popping in and you can pop
in any time you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just know you guys appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the original answer about it,
I guess that's at least three now that are
[SPEAKER_05]: for what we said.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a point of no return where we're
trying to get to because it looks shiny
[SPEAKER_05]: and shit, but once you get there,
it's the edge to it that's probably going
[SPEAKER_02]: to cut us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Cheddar Bob, I think that was directed
at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're listening to your sublime on
your porch and drinking your white claw,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe switch it up to some red wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I guess my original question has been
answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
