[SPEAKER_09]: I try and I think that I'm inspired today
I guess is really why I clap so good We
[SPEAKER_09]: have snow till and down home with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already some snow till You know and
it is really good and strong I guess it
[SPEAKER_09]: just got passed back to me, but it is
Yeah, I mean that's this guy guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is this is buy scream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh What is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Dan, I guess you you know,
you're
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're here with snow till and down
home I was saying earlier that this is
[SPEAKER_09]: some of the best weed we've ever had on
the table and I've Smoked it and I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: feeling it and I guess yeah, so we smoked
Some pie scream, which is some really
[SPEAKER_09]: exciting Flour from snow till and I guess
did we roll up some chem?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and you said was chem four chem
four.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes I feel like there's a lot to even talk
about on with the chem four But I guess
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah, I mean, so do you guys want to just
talk about what you've run?
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently and what you're stoked on I think
that's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure I I guess I'll just talk about
the chem because it's it's been a go-to
[SPEAKER_05]: for me for a really long time I've been
growing chem dog as long as I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: growing which is most of my life at this
point I've lost this clone and had it come
[SPEAKER_05]: back to me repeatedly That's why I said
tangential I'm a fan of sharing clones as
[SPEAKER_05]: much as possible backing them up Giving
them to trusted people so that just in
[SPEAKER_05]: case you fuck something up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go get it back That's why this
chem strain is still available What we're
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking on is from my indoor all organic
living soil alpine alpaca powered indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: my farm I make my own compost and worm
castings from alpaca manure and Use it for
[SPEAKER_05]: top dressing and reamending old soils Chem
dogs like my favorite personally because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a large amount of THC THC a
Consistently tests over 30% 33 35% and I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't actually select strains for THC,
but because it's such an uplifting high
[SPEAKER_05]: it's got Some mysterious sativa heritage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just find it really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can smoke it all day long It definitely
doesn't look nearly as pretty as most
[SPEAKER_05]: modern stuff out there, but I will always
be true to chem dog and sour diesel It's
[SPEAKER_05]: my favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: So years ago, I went through the cat I
went through chem special reserve seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a clone only it's been a clone
only for like 20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried all different kinds of chem
seeds and There's been things that were
[SPEAKER_05]: close, but never quite the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just never Really that that deep
garlic gas that I really love I think it
[SPEAKER_05]: performs best in greenhouses For like a
full-bodied flavor Indoor it's like really
[SPEAKER_05]: really bright green and that's really nice
But it still just tends to be kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: leafy and a bit airy And yeah,
I do a greenhouse and inside It'll always
[SPEAKER_05]: be my favorite other than chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do a whole variety of other strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of change with the times Currently
I have a bunch of weird stuff growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got Santa Cruz blue dream cut I think a
lot of people this year are bringing it
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the fifth person in like the
past two weeks I've heard say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, after I after I secured the clone in
the winter I heard about a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_05]: people doing this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The big blue dream flood of 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's gonna be a flood,
but it'll be a taste of blue dream out
[SPEAKER_05]: there Yeah, and I don't know any like real
commercial people doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of only know crafty people doing it
Which is kind of true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah blue dream headies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Craft blue dream, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna bring it back And then my
favorite is old meets new Old meets new
[SPEAKER_05]: meaning like I'm running Hindu Hindu
skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Hindu Kush crossed with skittles
old meets new I've got Larry derb,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is Larry and something else and f1
derb And then what's the other one I've
[SPEAKER_05]: got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah rainbow moon bow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So rainbow belts back crossed with moon
bow for a little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: A few others, but those are the ones I'm
most excited about I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: And are we gonna smoke any of that
tonight?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all growing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have here now is my indoor living
soil chem dog, full season straw Nana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've got little bags that will
open up of my greenhouse chem dog and my
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse banana punch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, indoor or greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone help this man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, I smoke mostly sun-grown and I
save indoor for special occasions sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here I'll let you tear this open and
get for a smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just some classic strains of
ours that we've been growing for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pie scream, guava gelato, motor breath OG
and James OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pie scream from gifted to me from Skunk
Tech through Austin from Aurora Genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why when you said that to me before
I was like, yeah, when you thought it was
[SPEAKER_07]: fruity like something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand why he would like it and I
think that he likes he subscribes to that
[SPEAKER_09]: Mean Genie and I think Peter has some Mean
Genie seeds up on the website right now,
[SPEAKER_07]: but he's wearing the shirt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super stone fruity, intense.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like big nugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually I find the pie scream to be
like kind of small on the smaller end
[SPEAKER_07]: actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are like the tops.
[SPEAKER_07]: It grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually very golf ball-y like kind
of like little rocks kind of like the
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies, but maybe slightly bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: But either way I grow it just because of
the turps and just how coated it is and
[SPEAKER_07]: how resinous it is and it stays sticky
forever like honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like three months down the line still.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, what Mean Genie do you have right
now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Cherry Limeade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's Cherry Limeade for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm holding in my hand two opposite ends
of the spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Chem Rosin and we have Straw Nana
Punch Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't really know which one to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan, which one would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said you're a chem head,
so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem during the day, Straw Nana at night
is kind of my vibe.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Straw Nana is definitely an indica
dominant hybrid and has an effect to back
[SPEAKER_05]: it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend not to classify indica and sativa,
but it works in this case because they're
[SPEAKER_05]: coldish strains, so they're not poly
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, start with the chem and then follow
with the Straw Nana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and you were telling us you wash
your rosin and it comes from your mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: light material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just want to talk about how you
believe those turps and what the sun does
[SPEAKER_01]: to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although sometimes the indoor flower
actually presents with a stronger nose
[SPEAKER_05]: than my greenhouse flower, the turps that
come out of the greenhouse flower in a
[SPEAKER_05]: rosin wash is far, far superior.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not always be the brightest white
rosin that some people are attracted to,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's a more full bodied flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the Chem Dog specifically,
it makes super, super good rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem Dog is a combination of terpenes and
VSCs, volatile sulfur compounds,
[SPEAKER_05]: is what makes up the flavor of Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've only recently kind of discovered
these VSC things and they wash through
[SPEAKER_05]: really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the smell of the Chem Dog rosin is more
like what I remember Chem Dog being 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago compared to the Chem Dog flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rosin is just like, whoa, holy cow,
that's like a lot of smell, garlic
[SPEAKER_05]: nastiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so yeah, it's just a concentrated
flavor that I love so much, Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: The true essence of the cannabinoids
you're looking for, they remind you of the
[SPEAKER_01]: past experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And do you think that, and I guess this is
a question for both of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know the viral loads of the plants
that you have in your, because you were
[SPEAKER_09]: describing a turp being like it was 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of people attribute that to
HLVD.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know the viral load?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have your stuff tested or do you
just sort of grow it out as?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've heard, sorry, I was holding that
coffin for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are differing theories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Behind how HLVD can affect the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of them is that if the plant is
super healthy, it stays latent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even in a test, it might not show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Similar to if you have like a certain
virus, you're only contagious while you're
[SPEAKER_07]: expressing symptoms, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have had all the stuff in my garden
tested and we have tested negative
[SPEAKER_07]: completely to HLVD, but I was actually
kind of shocked about that because I've
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely brought clones into my garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: That I was immediately able to tell had
HLVD and I would call them with like
[SPEAKER_07]: within a week of them being in my garden,
I noticed like kind of like how it would
[SPEAKER_07]: grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It grows similar to a seed, even though it
shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's also like branches will just
like break right off the stem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super weak, like green still, but like
kind of lighter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at the leaf sheen,
it's not quite as like healthy as it
[SPEAKER_07]: should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've gotten the clones like that from
people before.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I expected that it would have been
transferred to my garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: But from the last test we did,
we didn't, we actually tested negative.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like plant health is a thing
that both of you sort of share as a real
[SPEAKER_09]: one of the principles of your gardens at
least.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like we were just hoping that
you both would sort of get into
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation and that you two talking to
each other would be a lot more interesting
[SPEAKER_09]: than any of us chiming in, but you both
grow organically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, really that's the parallel is so I
deal with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might be importing viruses into my
garden, but we're organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's such thing as an immune system
in a plant just as there's an immune
[SPEAKER_05]: system in our body.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the plant is healthy and at its
greatest genetic potential because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: being, it's in symbiotic relationship with
all the microbiology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has all the nutrients at its root tips
thanks to that biology.
[SPEAKER_05]: Its immune system is intact and the viral
load will be undetectable, just like he
[SPEAKER_05]: said.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've also imported infected plants into
my garden and then tested them,
[SPEAKER_05]: tested neighboring plants at a later date
with zero virus detected.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also kind of similar when we're
talking about heavy metal contamination or
[SPEAKER_05]: other soil contamination.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your soil is healthy and organic and
full of microbes, then your plant can't
[SPEAKER_05]: uptake as much of potential heavy metals
that might be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something really cool that I
learned through testing my products for a
[SPEAKER_05]: variety of reasons is that even if there's
some heavy metals present and some things
[SPEAKER_05]: we use like kelp or something like that,
the plant doesn't necessarily take it all
[SPEAKER_05]: up if the microbiology is intact.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super loud in this room, so I'm not
sure if any of the people sitting next to
[SPEAKER_05]: me can actually hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm doing my best.
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured I'd say that for the camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as Peter hears us great,
we're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, as long as people at home can hear
us, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard most of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like 85 to 90 percent, I heard.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is totally popping, but soil health,
I mean, I feel like that's something you
[SPEAKER_09]: align to, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I agree with everything you said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask, are you all, you're all
inside?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're indoor, no-till living organic,
completely indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yep, just very climate-controlled,
temperature, humidity, everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just do no-till, same soil,
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so we recently replaced like almost
five-year-old soil like a year ago just
[SPEAKER_07]: because we wanted to start new.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it is kind of important to also do it
fresh because eventually, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: as we want to grow as a business,
we want to kind of see how we can get to
[SPEAKER_07]: where we want to be right off the start as
opposed to just relying on like the soil
[SPEAKER_07]: eventually bouncing out, which is kind of
what we did more when we first started
[SPEAKER_07]: growing no-till.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is important every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're limited on rooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we recently replaced five-year-old
soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this stuff is grown in soil that's
three years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a new room of ours back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that soil is still going, still going
strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, I think it's like the 14th cycle
at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: In that soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, and then our mother room is
actually our oldest soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's almost seven-year-old soil right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never specifically to a different genetic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do steer to some extent in the sense
that we try and maintain a certain amount
[SPEAKER_07]: of nutrition in the medium by whether it
be a top dress or mulching or whatever it
[SPEAKER_07]: might be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't, I would not say that we
specifically do it, like I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically mix this ratio of these types
of amendments for that strain,
[SPEAKER_07]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of like give it everything it might
need and then like the soil will figure it
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, there's more to crop
steering than just the food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's training, there's
pruning.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's veg time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which can be more important in a lot of
cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I find to be more important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, just making sure everything
is present in the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just managing the canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, I probably steer with
foliars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you do many foliars.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do a lot of foliars.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do a lot of KNF.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do a lot of composties.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to do a lot of SSTs, FPJs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I one time tried making my own fish
idrosalate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not recommend it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds stinky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I used it once, even though I was
like, I don't think I should be using it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, I've done it all as far as
that was concerned, but I'm much more
[SPEAKER_07]: minimalistic now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually don't, I don't like to spray
because spraying was, I think,
[SPEAKER_07]: what brought my first, well, I do spray,
I do a foliar spray two to three times a
[SPEAKER_07]: week during veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just an IPM with essential oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just to keep things at bay up until
they get like about two weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I found that it invited some stem rot
funguses into my soil when I would spray a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just spiking the humidity too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just a spike around that area down
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, which that stuff is gnarly because
that will kill a plant in like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you call your soil heavy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, heavy as in like does it weigh a lot
or heavy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Relative to potting soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Extremely heavy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of a mistake I made and I
learned that recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've been using lava rock very
religiously thinking that I don't want to
[SPEAKER_07]: cut my worms up or my soil biology and not
use perlite because there was people who
[SPEAKER_07]: claimed for a while that perlite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so then I discovered that this whole
time I discovered that perlite's just
[SPEAKER_07]: puffed up lava rock anyways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm like, oh, oh, that's kind of
a mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I'm gonna be working with perlite,
but I already made these beds back when I
[SPEAKER_07]: still thought that I had to do lava rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, my soil is insanely heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pumice is really heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use both limitedly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find pumice because it's heavy,
it doesn't rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I like about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just talking with someone about
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perlite is really helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that rumor, that myth of worms
disliking perlite came from people with
[SPEAKER_05]: like really dead potting soil with shit
tons of perlite.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like they put worms in it and the
worms would leave immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people told each other that myth
when in reality, if you have a healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: composty soil, you know, if your soil is
not just like a bag potting soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got lots of good, healthy organic
matter, like over 10%, 15, 20% organic
[SPEAKER_05]: matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the worms are going to want to stay
there because there's stuff for them to
[SPEAKER_05]: eat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most bagged soils, it's just like cocoa,
pea, and like a little bit of compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow a lot of worms on my farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being outside provides the benefit of
being able to compost and worm farm pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've shared millions, hundreds of
thousands of worms with my fellow farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them have told me,
oh, well, they just ran away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm near Grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Nevada County, California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you Vital Garden Supply?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my day job is for Vital Garden
Supply.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, that's your day job?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my day job.
[SPEAKER_07]: For Vital Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just met Brian at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: We hung out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a great time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian started that company like almost 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been working there just for a
couple months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I accept that.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you go back, good job.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this is work related.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 9 AM tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to remind Brian that we talked about
doing an FCP sessions at Vital.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he would be totally down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_11]: We already talked about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just remind him that I want to do that
because I'd be excited to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Grass Valley Sesh.
Yeah.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our store is actually in Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Grass Valley and Nevada City are right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those that don't know,
that's like an hour north of Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, and that cam literally took my
breath away, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you mentioned you grow your own worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the alpacas are in your packaging as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But could you mention how you got to that
point and what kind of drove you towards
[SPEAKER_01]: that specific route?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so my journey with worms goes back to
childhood, where I lived near a swamp and
[SPEAKER_05]: I was obsessed with bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was always collecting bugs and
chasing snakes and animals of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not where the story usually starts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like when I was a kid, I was really
into bugs in like a really nerdy kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then skip 20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of your favorite bugs?
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter likes the slugs right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter's pro slug.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pro slug?
[SPEAKER_05]: Banana slug?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been doing that literally up at
night, battering slugs and tracks.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beer track.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have them in little one gallon pots
that I bring inside because they were,
[SPEAKER_11]: I chopped the tops off plants that were
outside, but they were just one gallon.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I planted the new seeds in those,
but brought them inside.
[SPEAKER_11]: But all the bugs that were in it came in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So at night, slugs come up inside from the
bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like diatomaceous earth?
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_10]: We both just tried your straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to roll another joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, Rapier, from the Bug Talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bugs are cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so you asked me what my favorite bug
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably worms because they're super
fucking cool and they're pretty easy pets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black soldier flies are fun too,
but I have chickens and so flies are just
[SPEAKER_05]: like the bane of my existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feed it to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have enough flies at my property.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually started doing the fly traps
and then feeding them to the chickens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's like I'm catching like horse
flies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the mix bag?
[SPEAKER_09]: The what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Ben, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's a weed Vanna White joke?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was asking if there was a weed Vanna
White joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are each four, five milligrams,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Four milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a long sesh so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so Otis, Gabe, Ben, do you want to
explain what these are?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a cookie mix thing that we're
making and going to be releasing in
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're each infused with nano.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Ben, you're probably the best
equipped to speak about it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a this is Zazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Betty Crocker style cookie mix
infused with nano THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just launched two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to be available in dispensary
starting this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be at what's the other
greenhouse herbal center.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also going to be at a spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super exciting near the airport.
[SPEAKER_09]: High Note LAX.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're super stoked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, I mean, we just think that
it's a fun, tasty experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think of how it tastes
potentially compared to other edibles,
[SPEAKER_09]: dried baked goods on the market that come
pre-baked?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a delicious, delicious cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double fisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otis said it done well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the pleasure of being the guinea
pigs for Zazas about three or four times
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every time that they've done a
great job and everyone's just loved the
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they went they went good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to double up every time.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Vanishing Act is a testament to how
delicious they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm about to complete my portion of
the Vanishing Act.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, yeah, thank you guys so much
for trying the cookie.
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Ben, for helping hook them
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we will use the flour mill,
but we're rolling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to roll like five at once.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I went with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like for us, it feels full circle to
have real growers trying the edibles,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it really is all the product of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my mind, you are both like as
talented as they come in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I don't know, have either of you
ever like you wash your stuff for rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you make rosin as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, are there other sort of vehicles
or experiments that you run other than
[SPEAKER_05]: drying flour and washing it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I love edibles and those cookies are
really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to get some of those
take home with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: But have you ever made stuff yourself like
firecrackers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've made gummies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made all different kinds of butters
and chocolates and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: These days, I really do leave it up to the
professionals, though, because I make so
[SPEAKER_05]: many other things and do so many other
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I would regularly eat those cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, the other chocolate
bar that I like, Revive.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Kempdok Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently, I got to try the Emerald Cup
winning Space Gem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried a lot of different gummies out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I leave it to the professionals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a local one to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I shout somebody out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: They cozy cubes that works with our local
hash maker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gold country resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I'm rolling.
[SPEAKER_09]: And have there ever been snow-till
edibles?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or have you ever like had your food grade
hash go into a chew or something?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may have at one point.
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably has.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess what portion of your stuff
is getting washed right now or is it
[SPEAKER_09]: mostly getting dried?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: To tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we would like to be washing some more
than we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much, but you know, we want to wash a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had really great results washing
with certain strains so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go time has been pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: The resin quality is just so unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, both of your flour actually feels
like you're smoking rosin because it is so
[SPEAKER_09]: fully expressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is why it's stuff that I love to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, are there any, you know,
you seem to run new stuff every year,
[SPEAKER_09]: which I adore.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have a really refined stable,
which I also adore.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like, I don't know,
that is an interesting thing to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was actually going to say there are a
couple of strains that are new that we are
[SPEAKER_07]: starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that I'm most excited about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one of them that we started with
recently, but I don't have it here and I
[SPEAKER_07]: feel like an idiot for not bringing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make sure that you get some to try
because I'd love to hear your feedback on
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would be the J1, obviously.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and shout out Max because I've tried
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the J1 is?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say we've even refined it more
than probably since the batch because I
[SPEAKER_07]: think that was, I'm pretty sure Max tried
it from our first batch.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're already like four batches past that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been, it's been refined quite a
lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess what are the adjustments
you make batch to batch?
[SPEAKER_09]: If the flower, I mean, if the,
if the soil is staying the same,
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it environmental controls?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's generally going to be environmental
controls on how much the plant gets
[SPEAKER_07]: watered and how the plant gets trained.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be the two biggest
factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certain plants like a lot more water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certain plants like a lot less.
[SPEAKER_07]: J1 loves a lot of water because it is a
beast of a plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain Organics gave it, Ian gave it to
me and he's like, listen, she's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: go wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he, he was not getting just colas.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had never heard of J1 before meeting
him, like eight or nine months ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan sits there in horror, but it's Jack
adjacent, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: For everyone who doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know exactly what it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: J1 is Jack Crosswood's number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so, so it's basically a J1.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack, just with like a little bit of a
funk.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, like 95% Jack, 5% like,
wait, something funky.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm growing the one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that is,
[SPEAKER_07]: damn, I might have to look it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like Kandahar Afghani crossed with
something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, apparently like one of the
oldest classic berry, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like floral intensity berries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so this isn't something he bred.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just something he bought.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something he's held.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, this is like decades old,
this cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so this is like, I've been trying to
find, I've been trying to find those extra
[SPEAKER_07]: special cuts from way back when,
because something I hear a lot of people
[SPEAKER_07]: try and say, and tell me if you agree with
me on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people like to shit on,
basically, basically people like to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: back.
[SPEAKER_07]: That back in the day, there wasn't great
weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And only now we know what good weed even
is, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I've heard people, I've heard,
he's, he's heard this argument too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's total bullshit because back
before hydroponics came out, people were
[SPEAKER_07]: probably growing out in soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of me bringing back some of these
old 30 year old strains and then growing
[SPEAKER_07]: it indoor in soil is to kind of prove a
point that some of these genetics are
[SPEAKER_07]: actually amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And back then they probably did actually
know what good weed was.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that also gets us back to the plant
health thing and that the soil,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, if the plant is healthy,
ultimately the viral load may express in
[SPEAKER_09]: an undetectable type way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're then getting how it's smoked
back then.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's grown, you know, under the
conditions, then yeah, I don't,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, I think it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, so the old cuts don't appear as
good as the new cuts because the new cuts
[SPEAKER_09]: are dialed for new type rooms,
you know, and so run side by side,
[SPEAKER_09]: the two things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess the new thing is better,
but that's not necessarily, I mean,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is a complicated thought that I'm
struggling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also, I mean, there's a lot of,
there's a lot of aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a larger percentage of people
growing plants at this point are actually,
[SPEAKER_05]: their skills are beyond even a skilled
grower of the early eighties, late
[SPEAKER_05]: eighties, let's say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the information that's available
to the average growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to try the James O.G.?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's even like the worst growers today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't have to hash the white
label warning with that because that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually smoked bone white for us when you
tried it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, James does burn, does do whiter,
but yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a, I just like warn in general
because I'm like, people get triggered
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we were talking about
the old school friends actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we had smoked the snow till pie scream
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to your credit, you had talked about
that was your version of a candy and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, in your genetic stable, you don't
really have much that qualifies it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people don't really think of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't inclined to think of it as
such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you just want to talk about,
you know, what sort of direction you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to go with that or what you envision for
candy when you grow something and call it
[SPEAKER_01]: candy?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want candy to have some more
sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I feel like candy has this like
weird, almost similar to ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some of the candy I smell that's
supposed to be candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, my mic.
[SPEAKER_09]: You, of all people, talking about ice
cream cake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't grow it anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you not?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I only I only grew it for like six
months.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just I just like I grew it.
[SPEAKER_07]: After everyone stopped growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, wow, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been missing out the whole time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I tell people, I'm like,
I have the nicest weed you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'd be like, what's your like ice
cream cake?
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd be like, we don't even want to see
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, no, and I leave it at home.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, please just look at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was saying that in a positive way,
because you're one of the few people that
[SPEAKER_09]: know, you know, everything I just said
that it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll actually totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ice cream cake, the right cut in the right
hands is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it passes many people's tests under
100 different names, and they don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably the number one renamed
strain in the universe.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I mean, I think ice cream cake
is bomb.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you were saying that you want a candy
sweetness that's different than the sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of like you're going to roll and then just
smush it, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them really get in those turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we rolling up, James O.G.?
[SPEAKER_07]: So fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the James O.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: is a cut.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, would you tell the story or,
you know, part of the story?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's oh, yeah, no, it's a very short
story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a guy named James.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we didn't really know him that well,
but he had a grow in Oakland and he had a
[SPEAKER_07]: legal grow in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he let us come over there and he let
us pick up his genetics sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he gave us his James O.G.
[SPEAKER_07]: And about two to three months later,
just like moved up to Humboldt and his
[SPEAKER_07]: phone's been off ever since.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that person's named James.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just an O.G.
[SPEAKER_07]: from a guy named James.
[SPEAKER_07]: James claimed it was 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a suspicion about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You notice how it has almost like a
skittly kind of vibe going on,
[SPEAKER_07]: like something sweet about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can squish it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to roll that up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you like squished a little bit,
you should smell too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Within the gas, there's almost like that
same skittle tone.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's also a really nice lemon limey
really bomb.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we actually have someone here who's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's incredibly well equipped to talk
about this, that Otis, I mean,
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter wanted to join us earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to go grab our third.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like somewhere between Skywalker and
SFV, but not quite either one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll tell you my theory behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got something else in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the Pro Turpist out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's roll this shit up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Time to roll it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's roll it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my theory behind the James OG is that
it was this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy had an OG and probably an SFV or
something similar, something classic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would guess he crossed it with
something he used to call his.
[SPEAKER_07]: He called it Stone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a Sunset Sherbert grown up,
I think, honestly, in Nevada, Grass Valley
[SPEAKER_07]: area.
[SPEAKER_07]: He claimed he had this famous Sunset
Sherbert that people called it Stone and
[SPEAKER_07]: crossed it with everything and almost all
his genetics that he gave us was crossed
[SPEAKER_07]: with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would guess that this OG of his is
actually Sunset Sherbert crossed with some
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of OG, which is why it is both gassy,
but has some kind of like sweet,
[SPEAKER_07]: it has a sweetness and then it becomes
very complex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, sometimes turps cancel
themselves out, but almost almost in like
[SPEAKER_07]: a way that it's like, boy, there's
actually more now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a round flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just hogged something for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was bomb.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might need a little relay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that that's the chem?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the greenhouse chem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the greenhouse chem is smoking for
sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Between the greenhouse chem and the pie
scream, some of the most delicious smoke
[SPEAKER_09]: in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm going to send this one out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Peter, send this one out.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Greenhouse chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one was the indoor chem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people can't tell the difference
unless they look at it, actually.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, I guess do you like,
what is your indoor?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your indoor practices?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you do beds?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you do small containers?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm actually not even running an indoor
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I shut it down just a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually pretty happy about it just to
have a break.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing seven gallon fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were on, I don't know, less than 10
rounds on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were just being amended with my
worm castings in alpaca and a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of vital stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my indoor regimen was pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do it at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point, I'll revisit doing indoor.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were doing a no-till type situation
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I didn't empty the containers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just small containers relative
to most people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about as small as I would ever
recommend an organic pot inside,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I said, seven gallon fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wouldn't recommend somebody doing
organic in anything smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, it should be like 30 or more.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the square beds and everything,
it takes time to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't all start with all the
equipment and all the cool stuff that we
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had that stuff and gotten rid of it
and gotten it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people think that they
can't attempt no-till.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until they have a lot of things to do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't actually recycle your soil in a
container effectively.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just do it natural way and don't push it
too hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't try to over-fertilize it when you're
flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then your soil will be great next time
you want to plant in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just see that as a barrier to a lot of
people growing organically indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people turn to salts because it's
cleaner and easier inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just home-grow scale, I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to see people learning how to reuse
their 10 gallon pots, 15 gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to save the planet this much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to start up an indoor again,
but like I said, I have a day job now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually enjoying the diversity in
my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of just plants 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like plants mornings, nights,
and weekends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then other stuff helping people to
achieve organic practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: For my day job, which is super cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, but I want to hear Joe's response
before Peter interjects and wants to talk
[SPEAKER_09]: about hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a response.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Peter's in a hashy mood.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I was just agreeing with
everything he's saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, to me, it's really cool to
just hear people who have such beautiful
[SPEAKER_09]: experience talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think Peter wants to see the hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we throw Peter some of those hash
jars?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's chem and there's straw nana.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let you guys do the hash
talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a dinosaur with hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I just stick it in the
doobies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people look at me like I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just scooping huge amounts of rosin
into joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same.
Same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the James.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the James.
[SPEAKER_05]: The James.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love a good OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, take a look.
[SPEAKER_11]: The James OG is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to give it to, I want to give it to
Otis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's a dry full.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I need a hug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: A surprise guest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not familiar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's escaping me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So James OG, Otis, do you want to spark
this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let him taste this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Max, what did you just take a rip of?
[SPEAKER_09]: I
[SPEAKER_04]: just took a rip of some James OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, out there, out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubbler right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so yeah, so yeah, so yeah,
OG SD Rhino.
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a, I actually just picked this
up in San Diego a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 2007 SD Rhino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubbler, the Natty perk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a flower piece, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, I believe that is a 2000,
2003, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is over 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that a new piece or is it an older
piece?
[SPEAKER_05]: 2007.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that era, flower pieces were that
intricate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's all about the dab pieces.
[SPEAKER_09]: My life was really easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means I was in seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those, the, the pitcher flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, uh, the meant to look like
those fly traps, you know, pitcher,
[SPEAKER_05]: pitcher plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what it's supposed to be like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so excited for this James OG.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like, yeah, between that and the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: This chem is absolutely amazing too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love a good OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extremely fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super fruit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there he is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to jump on and try?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get, we'll get a smell review,
but, but it's been, we've had good,
[SPEAKER_09]: good hash today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: James OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to smoke it all the time.
Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say on camera that James OG
is one of my favorite OGs out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's killer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Super dank.
[SPEAKER_10]: And our homie Snow Till does a great job
growing this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've had lots of homies tell me that
they agree it's some of their favorite as
[SPEAKER_10]: well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's one of a couple of OG adjacent
things you run.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one that immediately comes to
mind is the motor breath.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Both really gassy, but I think really
representing from what sort of,
[SPEAKER_09]: I now understand kind of like a much more
focused and then also a much more broad
[SPEAKER_09]: gas where like the James OG has a lot of
nuance.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you call the James OG before?
[SPEAKER_07]: Rounder flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a round flavor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's round.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there are just so many, you know,
the pine is there, the lemon lime is
[SPEAKER_09]: there, the gas is there, but it is sort of
a chemigas that isn't the fuel interface
[SPEAKER_09]: thing that the motor breath is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's less diesel-y.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess you, so do you run any of the
other chems?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause you were talking about like the
fours one that's come back to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the chem four is the one that was
the parent of sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem four is the one that is really most
well known.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was also gifted a chem five and I've
tried any of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a chem five in veg right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say about the James OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really just, it really reminds me of...
Oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were saying about what I'm about to
hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, from the, from the smell,
I haven't smoked it yet, but it really
[SPEAKER_05]: just reminds me of some of the great,
great OG cuts of years past that had those
[SPEAKER_05]: piney and lemony flavors to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it's a 20 year old cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And were very nuanced OGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this might not be an adulterated OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might actually just be an old OG cut
that's kept really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, that's kind of what I get from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there was one that went around,
another just OG went around for years as
[SPEAKER_05]: lemon Larry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, it's funny cause other people have
told me that they think this Larry,
[SPEAKER_07]: that they thought this might be similar to
Larry.
[SPEAKER_07]: OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then at the same time, someone else
told me recently, like, cause the lemon
[SPEAKER_07]: Larry that I saw, but not lemon Larry,
I've heard of straight up Larry,
[SPEAKER_07]: but are they the same?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like lemon?
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably are, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Larry OG that I saw many years ago
for many, for many years, wasn't lemony at
[SPEAKER_05]: all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, so don't let them cause the name
has nothing to do with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they're the guy, Larry,
his nickname was lemon Larry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just learned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause he put lemon pills in all,
no, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: In all the bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ever heard about that back in the day?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is just a good old OG cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my opinion of it because they used
to have all kinds of nuances to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's like the two sides of gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like chem sour, which is,
you know, chem is parent of GMO.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the OGs, which were much
more nuanced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back in the day, there was probably,
50 different OG names that were all the
[SPEAKER_05]: same cut.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and I've heard that X is actually Y,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I would not want to get into it,
but it does seem like, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: the lore around OGs is not tough.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you had a chance to smell the motor
breath?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, motor breath is a newer cross.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: But have you just had a chance to check it
out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it is chem adjacent, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's sort of 91 ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got more of that like funk garlic
kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to the 91, you mentioned the four and
the five.
[SPEAKER_09]: So not the 91, not the D, not the CIS.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem 91 is also known as Chem 91 triple
back cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when DNA genetics re-bred the seeds a
bunch of years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fino hunted thousands of them and then
selected.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they kept one specific clone from a
seed run that they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was 10, 15 plus years after the
Chem four was discovered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 91 had gone away already or the 91
didn't exist?
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem 91 is a back cross of Chem seeds that
DNA genetics made.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was never a precursor thing that
they were.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Chem four is in theory clone
only since 91 or earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then where does the D fit into any of
this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy's nickname was Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then where does the CIS?
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem sister?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know Chem CIS.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember the story on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's adjacent, but I don't
actually know the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think there's other versions of the
story, but I also am inclined to believe
[SPEAKER_09]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just listen to what older people have
told me about it over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from New York originally, so there's
lots of sour diesel lore in New York cause
[SPEAKER_05]: that's where it's from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Massachusetts super skunk and Chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Chem dog seeds came from a Grateful
Dead show on the West coast, back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: East coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: They came in a bag of weed and there was
many seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem four was one, two, three,
fourth seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem five is fifth seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the people are still around to like
tell the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I'm not fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's super.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, you know, I feel inclined to
believe you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this the James?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it good?
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Might not be as candy as indoor version,
but it's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited for the Hindi Skittles.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but so wait, we were just talking
about Skittles over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What were you guys talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more mics for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about a multitude of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty stunned talking about Joe's
ear, but I appreciate him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joe was mentioning his favorite method
of consumption is edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my next question was, do you make your
own edibles?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but my favorite edible... Okay,
so my problem is when I make my own
[SPEAKER_07]: edibles, I end up with a little bit of an
edible problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everything stops getting... Then
I can't smoke anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I can't smoke anymore because I don't
feel it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, let's really get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got a 200 milligram cookie for me?
[SPEAKER_07]: You eat edibles all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people just look at you like,
what the fuck's wrong with this guy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, I was doing this thing where I was
sous vying the weed and then infusing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was sous vying the weed and then
infusing it to, in theory, trap things
[SPEAKER_10]: that would be volatilized when you do it
in an open oven.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that shit put me in a grayout for five
days, six days once.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was doing all my due diligence and
duties, but I did not remember what was
[SPEAKER_10]: happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can really get into an edible hole for
sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've done that in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I prefer to try for my own sake and for
the sake of me being able to actually
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to keep my tolerance down to about
40 milligrams, and then I'm pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: high from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do like to get dosed edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just going to shout out their rec
brand, but I think she does an amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wendy from Space Gems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Gems, she's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been buying Space Gems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've bought like $10,000 worth of Space
Gems in the past like three years alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week I come to the dispensary and
they see me with my dog and they give my
[SPEAKER_07]: dog a treat and they know I'm coming for
my two packs of Space Gems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I just see like 40 milligrams a
night.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that math made exact
sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe three I get a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I really love Space Gems.
[SPEAKER_07]: NorCal.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I might start buying some Zaza
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humble and from Wendy, I believe is her
name.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like it's all bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not I mean, rosin edibles are
awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like so makes hers different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they smack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's just ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They smack.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I'm sure they figured it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if it's ice water hash, hash is
technically already decarb.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why people love making edibles with
hash back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why when you had that hash brownie
that tasted real hashy, you knew you were
[SPEAKER_07]: it wasn't going to end.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't going to end well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And your heart would start racing and
you'd be like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings back good memories and bad
memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I could get that high anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're all chasing that first time
high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a silly game of stopping smoke to
enjoy smoking sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's why it's a necessity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full season straw Nana smells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're excited to smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's that rosin?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to double up on the straw
Nana.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a shortbread banana I grow,
but very rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barely like.
[SPEAKER_07]: My straw Nana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that one would be a cool one to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't grow a lot of it because it's a
terribly slow vegging plant and it does
[SPEAKER_07]: not yield very well, but it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Otis, we were talking on the phone
with a couple of breeder homies,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently you had straw Nana being,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finicky.
[SPEAKER_09]: Finicky, but timeless.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is super timeless.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is insanely strawberry banana like.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like every time you smell it,
you're like, it's that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ventured to grow straw Nana
indoors or was it always a greenhouse for
[SPEAKER_09]: you?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've never grown it indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have maybe tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kept running different things indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't settle on one thing other than
the cab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I for a period of time was chasing look
because that's what people were after,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I got really bored with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of what I've grown indoors over my
lifetime is Cammon Sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour D.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's because I'm from New York,
but I'll always and forever probably hold
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour Diesel well grown organically inside
over all other flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we don't have it tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something candy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe grows one of the best, this sour,
sour headband.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or am I totally?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sour Diesel X headband.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sour headband.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sour Diesel X headband.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's I feel like it's a very cool
turp.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with you that it's,
you know, that's another strong,
[SPEAKER_09]: timeless one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a newer addition to your.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are the other newer ones that
you're looking at?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so it was just the one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you tried my Mirage ever?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my Mirage is like.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, this is a crazy strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took it out of production because it was
back when tangy orange turps just weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: like people weren't vibing with that at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm bringing it back now because it's
more orange than anything, not even tangy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like straight up orange turps,
which I miss.
[SPEAKER_07]: Massive growing plant and hasn't test
insanely high for turps like it tested at
[SPEAKER_07]: like five plus percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have money to pay the labs
off, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I always say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our friend is like, yeah, Mike,
no fake tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys can have whichever Mike you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably need time to keep using that
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it's off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: There might be a little battery that
popped up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a battery that popped out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just unplugged the couch.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a battery somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am just we get an extra mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do get an orange turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we have a, you know, a good friend
who did this thing called Omakase that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, was this orange, orange
skittles.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like chop cookie orange skittles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I it had such an amazing reception out
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that people kind of actually want
that flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're like craving it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it goes through a cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people haven't seen that in a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now all of a sudden, like aren't that's
why I'm doing the J1, although not orange.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still got that turpentine rich.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can call it honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's that super turpentine
rich, like just makes your nose wrinkle in
[SPEAKER_07]: the best way possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everyone remembers their first time
smelling Jack.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, oh, my God, what is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know we could smell that.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely makes your nose pop it out of
my chest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if it's just like the
time that I started smoking, but I
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciate that turp most with like a
train wrecky thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's obviously in all of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You ever try time wreck?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's time wreck?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was train wreck times maybe XJ 13.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to smoke a lot of XJ 13 or maybe or
maybe it was something or maybe time train
[SPEAKER_07]: wreck across the space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I never mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could be making all this up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't don't take my word on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me look it up.
This
[SPEAKER_01]: is a hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Straw Nana on straw Nana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, both full term flower and rosin all
from full term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People probably don't see a whole lot of
like really good representations of full
[SPEAKER_05]: term flower train wreckage trinity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And trinity is another one that I feel
like that's a time wreck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I would have a classic TJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the trinity is one of the melting
weed for me back in the day that I used to
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke it based on my tolerance.
[SPEAKER_09]: My melting is actually how I would
describe my experience tonight with the
[SPEAKER_09]: pie scream.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that was bomb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the highest testing strain we've
ever tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and and what's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So usually I find this weird relationship
or like lower testing THC sometimes is
[SPEAKER_07]: higher testing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like my general like made up anecdotal
theory from the little evidence I have of
[SPEAKER_07]: it is would be that there's probably a
limited amount of surface area for oils to
[SPEAKER_07]: present itself on the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terpenes are oils as well as the as THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by having more of one de facto,
you may limit it on another scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the pie scream tests are like three
and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, not an adulter test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three and a half percent terps at and
right just at about 40 percent total
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty mind
melting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy to me how high it has.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we broke up earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to highlight that joint was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time I've ever smoked a
straw nana on a straw nana before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this rosin inside of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin, straw nana, rosin on straw nana
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you, Joe, but to me
that the essence is just insanely floral,
[SPEAKER_01]: super sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was truly a blessing to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delicious organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puff it gently.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a professional hash hole roller.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it'll work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I love the single origin max out on
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a thing of beauty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And full season flower grown right and
preserved properly is really a treat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just sad it's so often treated as
subpar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the time it gets into most people's
hands, it's been oxidized and it's lost so
[SPEAKER_05]: much of its essence.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a big jar of some straw nana and
some other huge you gave me mean fucking
[SPEAKER_10]: packs in the future, some huge nugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Apples and bananas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, the apples and bananas?
[SPEAKER_10]: Big, fluffy, crazy things.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, it was straw nana.
[SPEAKER_10]: And straw nana.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the huge, the spears.
[SPEAKER_10]: You gave it to us like the emeralds come.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was both when you came to LA and also
when we went up to Emerald and Ego.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wherever we were hanging out in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was apples and bananas.
[SPEAKER_10]: You also had straw nana when you came to
visit in LA, though.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do have a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I can't, I have no sense of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was like a really long time
since I saw you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was five months.
[SPEAKER_05]: What month is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you came down and you saw
the LA organics girl, that was before
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that was.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was straw nana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was both.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was both.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there was also truffle, pink truffle
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was outdoor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there is a bunch of different
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The straw nana, I just like, I held back
and I like, I thought I didn't even take
[SPEAKER_05]: it out of the curing room for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess I'm mistaken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think whatever you gave us is
dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the apples and bananas.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I think I also shared with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was these gigantic, really fluffy,
leafy buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of a random outdoor plant that
got lots of good compost and not much
[SPEAKER_05]: else.
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out at over five percent turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five point four eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was like the ugliest, weirdest bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown in a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still have a big bag of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just give them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's got such a wild smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is straw, straw nana squared.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is such an intense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's like really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Strawberry and bananas to the face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a smoothie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you both like most?
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we asked this question at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, what is, you know, your favorite
thing to grow?
[SPEAKER_09]: You've sort of said the ken.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like, what is your favorite thing to
smoke that you grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: Me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or to vaporize or to, you know.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I, OK, like, is the question like if I
was on an island and I could pick one
[SPEAKER_07]: thing and that was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pie scream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pie scream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'll never, I'll never.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one strain that I have not
managed to develop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any kind of like, like cannabinoid
tolerance to, you know, like certain
[SPEAKER_07]: strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: You smoke it for a while and you start
smoking something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so yeah, that would be my pie scream.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would have like different answers
for different scenarios.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it was for the rest of my life pie
scream, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You win Skunk Tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got the knockout when you need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for you, would it be the Ken 4?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be?
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be because I actually like,
I like a get up and go kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm not like a couple times a day
smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like a couple times an hour smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You rolled up at least three quarters of
an ounce under an hour here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone wants to attest that
statement, just rewind that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is cool as hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a cool sesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

drive or fly?
[SPEAKER_05]: I drove.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to see something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Norco.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like an eight hour drive.
