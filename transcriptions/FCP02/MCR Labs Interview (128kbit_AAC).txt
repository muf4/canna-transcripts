[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Lobster Fam Farms here at MCR Labs
with Mike to ask a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another day in paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, could you please explain the
importance of independent labs to verify
[SPEAKER_00]: clean products in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So independent labs are really doing a
service both for the consumer of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product and also the cultivators
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that people
wouldn't necessarily know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of incredible cultivators,
people who've been growing cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years, decades even at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you never had an impetus to check
things like your heavy metal or even
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides in certain areas, if you're
growing in a home where maybe there was
[SPEAKER_01]: like extermination with a previous owner,
things you wouldn't expect, through
[SPEAKER_01]: actually testing this product,
you're able to pinpoint things that could
[SPEAKER_01]: be hazardous to the consumer or even the
producer when they're working with the
[SPEAKER_01]: material and really give you an idea to
make sure, hey, I'm growing things safely,
[SPEAKER_01]: my product's getting to the client,
it's safe, and I'm also safe while I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: producing this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome to think of not only the
consumers but the producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you please explain the value of THC
testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a side question, do you notice that
the results have more of an impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: sales in certain regions over others?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do see a lot of people are chasing
THC numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, a lot of the times it's
either really new people who don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: much about terpenes or other cannabinoids
or people who are maybe even competitive
[SPEAKER_01]: with themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to push that high THC number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really useful for a number of
reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So even just outside of THC or THCA,
which is what a lot of people are thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: of when they're thinking of the
psychedelic effect or the mental impacts
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis, there's a lot of other
cannabinoids that we test as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the consumer, them knowing the THC
number is gonna be useful because we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want anybody to consume more THC than they
want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know nobody's gonna overdose on THC,
but anybody who's spent a significant
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time around cannabis has
probably gotten uncomfortably high once or
[SPEAKER_01]: twice in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we really want to avoid,
especially if you're looking for a
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to give your grandma a
400-milligram chocolate chip cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be like, hey, Graham,
take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your arthritis is gonna feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the production standpoint,
cannabinoids can also kind of give you an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea about if you're harvesting
potentially too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we test for CBGA, which is a precursor
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually gonna break down into your
THCA or your CBDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're noticing, hey, I'm not
getting the THC numbers I wanted to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can also look at your CBGA numbers and
say, hey, that's really spiked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should go push a little further out to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna let that molecule turn more
into the cannabinoid that I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my own experience, one of the lab
tests I did a couple of months ago was a
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO cookie derivative that's known to go a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I let it go 10 and a half,
11 weeks, and it still had 2% CBG in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a clear-cut indication,
like you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know that before I started
asking people, is this something special
[SPEAKER_00]: that it has this amount of CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the other three or four tests I
had done with the same variety didn't show
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it must just be that I took those long
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as these things come across,
they're becoming more useful to me in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, even just a couple months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I know this round I'm gonna let it
go at least an extra week and let it go
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also kind of useful as a tool for
trend analysis too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you grow the same strain cycle
after cycle after cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, hey, I'm down like 5%
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you know that there's
something that's kind of wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to check out my HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I have hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of clues you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you foresee testing of a wider range of
cannabinoids and terpenes in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk a lot about the entourage
effect in campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself, I'm a pretty casual smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my younger days, I was chasing THC just
like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm really more interested in what
sort of unique effect am I gonna get when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at a bunch of different
terpenes at different concentrations and
[SPEAKER_01]: levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I gonna get from different
cannabinoid profiles?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a friend, she gets really anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, hey, you need to try maybe a
one-to-one or something with a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: high CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So broadening our ability to dial in and
quantify these different compounds I think
[SPEAKER_01]: serves the consumer in a really great way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really lets them tailor their own personal
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, when do you think that
cannabis labs will be held to the same lab
[SPEAKER_00]: standards as other industries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say calibration, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's with the asterisks if you guys
don't feel you're there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just assuming that cannabis labs are
behind the rest of any other industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question and a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a really fresh industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talk to other microbiologists a lot
and we talk about other agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: commodities and they say, hey,
if you were testing peanuts, there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: huge statewide society of peanuts and
they're like, everything needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly how we want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's really a lot more on the
individual labs themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I believe every lab needs to
have a 17.025 ISO accreditation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are minimum standards that need
to be met, but anything beyond that is
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of up to the lab standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab ownerships themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see some labs are going above and
beyond, which we really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have good data integrity there and
then others are just like, what do I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to do to meet regulatory requirements?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think hopefully sooner than later,
but if we end up at a federal legal level,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're gonna see some more
strictness and maybe some more structure
[SPEAKER_01]: to the quality of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually one of my next
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you foresee cannabis testing
developing if and when national and
[SPEAKER_00]: international markets open up?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll speculate that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just assume that three to five to 10
years, it's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you foresee the testing industry
kind of aligning with each other or the
[SPEAKER_00]: feds demanding that it gets aligned?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're gonna see kind of a change
in how things are tested and I'm hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: that we'll see more data transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a lot of the times now,
a lot of cultivators have issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiological action limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a microbiologist, so I'm more on the
side of cost reduction, but I'm also an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor grower and I understand the
reality of the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might see things like regulations
changing, maybe for an outdoor cultivator,
[SPEAKER_01]: raising those action limits, maybe with
the transparency that on the label you can
[SPEAKER_01]: read a CFU program or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to that degree as well,
as it becomes federally legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna be able to actually do
research at universities and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We oftentimes, at MCR down in
Massachusetts, we're doing speciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to say, hey, we have this
fungus that we found on your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dive into that a little deeper and it's
like, oh, it produces ABC mycotoxins that
[SPEAKER_01]: are not required by any state for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we're gonna see a broader
understanding of cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural commodity and we're gonna
know, hey, maybe we should be looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: these mycotoxins and not these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is a safe microbial action
limit versus this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, if any, are the differences between
testing a rec and med cannabis and do you
[SPEAKER_00]: notice a difference in med versus rec as
far as cleanliness, potency, or just
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever other things you guys are looking
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really seeing a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we have a big enough data
set at this point to really notice a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know in Maine, I believe it is
recreational is required testing versus
[SPEAKER_01]: medical, which is not required.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might see things that are kind of
sneaking under the table in medical if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not getting tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, as far as the quality of
production, most people that are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis want to grow the best material
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to be pretty standard across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar as far as potency and terpenes and
all that, it seems like everyone's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying as hard as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, this is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about the salary rates for
cannabis lab techs and does that match up
[SPEAKER_00]: to other industries?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, at this point, we don't
have the money that Big Pharma has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to be a lab tech who's
working for Pfizer, you're obviously going
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a lot more than a lab tech that's
working at a cannabis analytical lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference there, though, is you're
kind of associated with an industry that
[SPEAKER_01]: you might believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have more of a personal stake in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know somebody that medical cannabis
has helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of helps to dull the sting
if you're not making as much as your buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: who's working with Big Pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully, as the industry matures,
we'll see those pay rates start to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: come more in line with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that answer, though, because I
don't think that it's necessarily drawing
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the talent pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's drawing the top of the
passion pool is the way that I've thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that the salaries catch up
to that passion as it becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the society will see the
value in it, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, it's another tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of all the allegations
of labs and some that have been caught
[SPEAKER_00]: skewing the test results?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say if it's a vertically
integrated lab into a grow in a retail
[SPEAKER_00]: shop, or it's just a friend's lab,
or it's even just a business partnership
[SPEAKER_00]: that someone might not know they're
involved in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are happening in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been caught out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know, how do we keep
corruption out of the cannabis labs as
[SPEAKER_00]: these things move forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we do so that the cannabis labs do
get the respect and the verification that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to need moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an awesome question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab shopping is a real and big problem in
the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, kind of relies on the
regulators to make sure that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a couple steps we could take
to kind of bring the issues to the
[SPEAKER_01]: foreground and make everything a little
more transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I'm really in favor of data
transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you should be able to know
where products tested, and you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to see the exact results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to know, hey, this passed for
yeast mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know, hey, what was the exact
CFE program with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we see a lab and it's passing
everything for yeast mold, that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But things like secret shopper programs
like what they do down in Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_01]: are really useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy a product, maybe a regulatory
body like the CCC, take it to a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: different labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's huge discrepancies,
then that should sort of indicate to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, there's a problem here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard that being done yet
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope to see it happening all over the
place if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Maine is still ahead of that curve
because it's not so competitive yet to
[SPEAKER_00]: where people are going to those lengths to
ensure success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that we can get ahead of the
curve before we fall behind ethics and
[SPEAKER_00]: moral practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a business perspective, you want to
have the highest THC possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to pass as much product as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not doing yourself a service if
you're going to be lab shopping because
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually this will get cracked down on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your grow is full of microbes and
you've been lying about 10% of your THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to bite you in the butt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reputation is going to be more
valuable than a quick high score.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we'll use this after the
interview, but one thing that I found very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, I've lived in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved in the industry since
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Maine is the first place where I've
seen where the THC results, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: the storefront or the consumer,
they could really care less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's 25%, 30%, 12%, like it doesn't
seem to really make a difference on
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the patient or the casual consumer
or the big storefront or the casual
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I'm still shaking my head at
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't get it, but I do think it's
kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's just like results oriented or,
you know, I mean, you could call it bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science, but I feel like in conjunction
with the actual lab science and also with
[SPEAKER_00]: people just, you know, they're anecdotals,
you know, I mean, we should, we should
[SPEAKER_00]: think that that matters because that is
real data to me, even if it's like bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Maine's an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about bro science.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background's a little bit more like
plant soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty particularly when I got into the
industry, I was growing with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators and they were using the bro
science and it's not all bro science,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They might just not know the scientific
terminology to phrase what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: observing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your point, yeah, these are
anecdotes that we should be investigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as we see federal legality,
hopefully we can actually dive into that
[SPEAKER_01]: and get to the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The narrative I've been trying to kick
recently is bros with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, if anyone's heard of the
government lab in Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_00]: that grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, to me, that's science without
any bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never had the displeasure of
trying their products, but for many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: few people that have, I mean, they've
never given rave reviews of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gotta go a hundred percent science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these government labs have been
dialed in for the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at it that way, it's like,
I'm really trying to kick the narrative of
[SPEAKER_00]: bros with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people that, cause science is just
observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you say, repeating experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people are getting a skewed
vision on what science is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the bros have been doing it a
long time, even if they can't really,
[SPEAKER_00]: describe what they've noticed in the right
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you say, like, I think bros with
science is going to be the way forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for the dank, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I guess that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to call it citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
Okay.
