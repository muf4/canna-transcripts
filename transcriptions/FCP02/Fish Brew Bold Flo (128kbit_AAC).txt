[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Keith from Fishbrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're sitting here in our 3,000
square foot greenhouse where we do all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our research with our different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I wanted to talk about Bold Flow,
which is one of our products made here on
[SPEAKER_00]: Cape Cod at our trout hatchery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trout here are raised for stocking
ponds, and with those fish we extract the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste with a special filtration system
that we've designed, and that waste is our
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold Flow products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is full of beneficial fungi,
bacteria, protozoa, amoebas, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes, and also full of diatoms,
which is plankton that produces oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a key point for our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diatoms not only produce oxygen in the
water, but also produce oxygen at the root
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also are great structures for
bacteria and fungal to grow on,
[SPEAKER_00]: attach to, and also aggregate your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diatoms keep reproducing in the bottle
over as much as two years, which keeps the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle oxygenated, which keeps the product
in the bottle aerobic instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic, which is key to this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recommend for just watering,
for container gardening, for raised beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: for straight in the soil gardening,
whether it's vegetables, house plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabis, we recommend 15 milliliters,
which is as simple as three cap fulls of
[SPEAKER_00]: this product to one gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two gallon watering,
so we would add six cap fulls to this
[SPEAKER_00]: watering can, and then water your plants
at a normal watering rate so you see your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil gets damp and you have adequate
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that once a week with this product,
regardless of the age of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is also unique from our other
products in that we like to use this
[SPEAKER_00]: product from seed all the way to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it with multiple different
plants, including this cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is seeded directly in soil,
fed bold flow on day number seven from
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding, and has only been on bold flow up
until today, which is the first day of
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, it's in its budding stage,
blooming stage, so this product can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used through all stages, vegetation and
bud and bloom, of all the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've tried it on at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example is this pepper plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pepper plant has been getting
harvested since May 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now September 1, and as you can see,
it's still loaded with peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lunchbox or mini pepper plant,
and as you can see, there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit still being produced, even new buds
here at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this plant gets watered once a
week with bold flow at the given rate on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of the bottle, which is 15
milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: House plants, it can be used on house
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use it during transplant of
house plants, so as I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant this aloe plant, and I'm going
to break away, you can see the root
[SPEAKER_00]: development on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty extensive root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aloe plants tend to like to be crowded a
little bit, so as this plant gets broken
[SPEAKER_00]: off and be separated out to be
transplanted, we would do really simple
[SPEAKER_00]: root wrench of this product using the bold
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be as simple as getting the plant
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could leave it in there for five to 10
minutes, pull it out, transplant into your
[SPEAKER_00]: potting soil, water once a week with the
bold flow, and within months, your aloe
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will look like this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rosemary plant that was also
started from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was started from seed at about 28
days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also only use bold flow on that from seed
to this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the rosemary plant is
thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like to use the bold flow
for, different than some of our other
[SPEAKER_00]: products, is I like to use it for cloning,
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, once again, is as simple as using
100 mils of this product, so that's 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 mils of that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let that sit in this water out of
the direct sunlight, preferably keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: the water temperature cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we'll put a small aerator in
there to keep it aerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tomato plant will start to root and
be ready to transplant in 10 to 11 days
[SPEAKER_00]: from today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we'll do is we'll place this plant
off to the side and we'll come back in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 days and we'll see how it's
developing with just using the bold flow
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing we've used it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ginger plant where we soaked the
ginger root in bold flow at a rate of 100
[SPEAKER_00]: mils of bold flow to 100 mils of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did several bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant was done about 32 days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can once again see the root
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'll actually do is I'll break this
away a little bit so you can actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: the ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ginger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ginger root that was soaked in
bold flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Placed in soil and then later has been
watered once a week with the bold flow
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, it's really green,
bright green, getting plenty of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy uptake of any other nutrients you may
or may not want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bold flow is also a product that you can
use with other nutrient products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested it with several other
nutrient products and had good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a soil conditioner or a plant
probiotic which means it's adding your
[SPEAKER_00]: living organisms to your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product, and you can go onto our
website, fishbrew.com and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: different testing results we have with
different products including bold flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: including any testing that we've done,
heavy metal testing, biological testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as any NPK or testing of that
nature of each one of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product here has had great results
with living soil products in that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: high in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high in fungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high in beneficial protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amoebas, as I mentioned, diatoms,
which is really the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product gives your plants a nice
silica boost when needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also works very well with other living
products, other living soils that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried it on in the past and we're still
continuing to work on to see how it
[SPEAKER_00]: develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, like myself, and I'm a little biased
and this is one of my favorite products
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can use it from seed to start
and I don't have to worry about burning
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product is a biology product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has plenty of, as I mentioned,
beneficial bacteria and fungi so you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about nitrogen overload.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about burning the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it on the leaves of your
plants, use it as a foliar spray on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, it's not going to burn your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to foliar spray so
we have done some work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have used it on a few of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still doing trials on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results will be coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product has also been used on turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great on lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had several clients use it on their
lawns here on Cape Cod and have had very
[SPEAKER_00]: good results, especially this year during
a drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually helped retain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are claiming it's helped
retain water in their lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this product can be used, like I said,
for many, many different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used on blueberry,
it can be used on shrubs, it can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: on rhododendrons, we've used it on
hydrangeas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just some fig trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a fig tree here on the farm that
last year produced over 160 figs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we used it on pawpaws and we saw
our pawpaw right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pawpaw girl has roughly 142 pawpaws,
which is kind of unique here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: England on Cape Cod, but the plants are
doing really well on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product here you can use weekly is
what we recommend when you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As your plant gets developed or it's a
house plant that is going to have many
[SPEAKER_00]: years, you can extend it and go every
other week on the Gold Floor products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any questions, like I said,
you can go to our website where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find our contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
