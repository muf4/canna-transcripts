[SPEAKER_02]: So this is All Seasons Arms, this is the
distribution location, and then also
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing the R&D here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross them, grow them, test them,
keep the mums, throw away everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't make the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you want to walk down the line
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like lemon, chem, calio is genetics I
brought in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got laughing gas, what's our
genetics we're using to breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chauffeur, Skywalker, Fire OG,
GDP, Long Valley, Royal Cush, crossed with
[SPEAKER_01]: White Rhino Manic, crosses I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Lemon 91 Chem, crossed with Thin
Mints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horchata, Great Grass, crossed with Banana
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Runt, Super Runt, Lemon Cherry,
Gelatos, RS-11s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some more of the mums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is when the mums get about
this height, I have them clone them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they root, we throw them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I'm not setting myself up for a
lot of problems with big mums.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as the next one roots,
you'll throw this one away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll throw these mums away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And start our mums over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically how many clones do you root
out just to make sure you have redundancy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, two because we're pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take two of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once one roots, we replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what those are
replacements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are also the replacements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our system is when there's a hole
punched in the tag, that means they're
[SPEAKER_01]: cloned up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our way to keep track of what's
been cloned and what's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: exchanged out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plastic over the lights is because
plants have a hard time handling the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of light these put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, these are NanoLux?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't clone under these lights
and you clone under fluorescents,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get really bad lumen shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through some lumen shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I diffused the lights with plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that they're coming back, we'll get
rid of the plastic and start cloning under
[SPEAKER_01]: the LEDs only, not the fluorescents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so kind of you were saying before,
like the goal is for you to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: do breeding and selection and find some
cool, unique stuff that no one else has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way they're not all selling the
same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their own unique stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, these are the latest
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biscotti Sherberts and Rents and Lemon
Cherry Gelatos and RS-11s and Laughing
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sour Monkeys and Punk Rock Rent
Crosses, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all feminized, but kind of LA's
finest stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll germ them here,
plug them, and then they'll come,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can follow me over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come into this, our flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we do the flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the R&D flower room, because you
guys have the, like, once you select
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, you send it out to the main
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same lights, the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we only have to rent four lights,
and we're learning to do a whole tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when are you next going to put stuff in
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next step is we'll clean this all
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to plug those little suckers
in six inch cubes and start rocking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll run all these four tents
full to find the winners out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to do the hard job of
smoking it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all downstairs, the last harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even got through that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what some of these are.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the kind of pots I like,
especially outdoors in LA where everything
[SPEAKER_02]: bakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are getting big, so we threw them
in there, but normally I like to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: rock wall, because it's pretty quick and I
can flush them really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then is there kind of a balance
between, like, you know, you have some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's pretty hypey, but then also
some of your stuff, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I view it like the top pop 40 song meets,
like, the 70s, like, obscure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what you may like and what I may
like doesn't necessarily mean it applies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Joe and Derek have an idea of their
clientele.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they help me gear my breeding towards
what they think their clientele is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've got old stuff from
Colombians, the Jalalabads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Jalalabad star.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cross it to lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Manic Callios are stuff we did that's
downstairs to see if we like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, these get trimmed down a lot
because they grow so fast and we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only send a couple clones down there
and then they mom them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Manic Callios, Manic Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got and some garlic keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell the keef even.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from one of the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the garlic skunk that one of the
mills guy did, AB Mills from Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: washed it and was like freaking say like,
dude, this is some of the skunkiest stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring you some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is some of the dry sift garlic
skunk that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty reeky, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you got some Albert Walker dog,
Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put the labels on the bottom so some
times if you put them on the lids,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get the lids confused.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go with Super Defire, Colombian Haze,
two of the different phenols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stole it from a fifties pulp artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the early James Bond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you were reading the James Bond
books, like or Hardy Boys or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are like edgy adult comics in the
fifties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause everyone has to do with chicks that
are hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the artwork, like the pinup
style artwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is fun zone is the super D cross
with Albert Walker dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super D these two crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this crossed with that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fino Hunter is the Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then James Bond heads to the Casmo,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Albert Walker cross with the
super D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got the tiger eye,
which is a scene increase of the Albert
[SPEAKER_01]: Walker OG dog down in that angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got the Albert Walker cross that
Albert Walker dog, which is this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albert Hitman is just a seed increase of
the Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these are pretty, pretty
impressive little nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one was the Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'd probably be your next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what dog these are seeds
from Kana Cabana from about 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably pretty controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just reminds me of a hundred percent
NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a complete NL structure trimmed and
untrimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was one of the different females,
a little more levy, but it's a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of odd zap.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But structure, everything to me was just
screaming NL and it kind of makes sense
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it's from Pacific Northwest,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the Albert Walker dog.
Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albert Walker dog, Albert Walker dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do we have a, we had a straight
Albert Walker, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one I think is screaming in
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe it NL four ish three,
maybe not too short, but kind of short.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the hybrid texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same leaf texture, brachs,
jives, a little golden kinda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I'm not ever familiar with an NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled like that, but although I
haven't tried all the NLs either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how would you describe kind of
Colombians in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from the, how they grow and bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to those right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at these real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super D fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what made the garlic skunk some of
the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is probably my desert island
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the garlic skunk or this stuff,
especially if you squeeze one of the nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oily, super strong, just skunk gas and
some other kind of greatness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a couple of phenos out of the
haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's a little more foxtail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oily smells a lot more like Cali mist,
kind of sour, acridy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this one's a little more dense
with the redder hairs, probably a Punta
[SPEAKER_01]: Rojo possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has a little more of the
frankincense clove type of honey thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really squeeze one,
you can really get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's most likely is what made the
original haze before it goes to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially these little guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty Cali misty, sour,
Kiwi, tropical, acrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unsurprising, it's got some good kick
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work for being what?
[SPEAKER_01]: From 1977, 45 something year old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to start rolling joints of all
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're covered because you like to do
dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a little Keef and you can do
bong tokes joints, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's your power pack set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have the did the canisters come in
or not yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Kona Gold?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't ordered them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, still in limbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Kona Gold at home, but all this
is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot like Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a little worried when people grow
the seeds, they're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, but on the same hand, that's what it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't make it better than it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like compared to this, this is like,
wow, smell wise, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I made a whole lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kind of odd because you kind
of get a jacky, train wrecky, Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asian, sharp, sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed a lot of the Southeast Asian
strains have that kind of sharp sour
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, astringent, real astringent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same with this guy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you trim all the purple leaves off,
that's what you end up with green nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably more of a lumen shock or
stress than genetic purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff though, just so sticky,
greasy, oily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a chem structured nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not D, but 91 and four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smell is incredible and that is
suckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the same stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Albert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unique and different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about Albert Walker the
other week, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my story to discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know it's dirty 40 year old strain
from Pacific Northwest clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it's an Afghan skunk or
something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's fairy tales everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus looks is one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got to test drive them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like hot looking chicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You finally got the hot chick and you get
her home and she's just like a boring
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of wet wonder bread or something in
bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my goal is supermodel Polar stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to be freaking bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super good looking and wild in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's good, no flavor, no punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's strong with no flavor,
it's gotta go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells 100% like Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I could find that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it, but it's such a unique
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a biscotti sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reversed a biscotti sherbert for a
pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the H one five is biscotti
sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a whiff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where I went for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some manic Irene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's not a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super frosty, super gnarly, kind of like a
GMO real frosty Indica ish kinda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some roadkill to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the white lemon 91 cam across with
thin mints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firecracker, burnt rubber, candy,
gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a, there's a lot of stuff
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just find some good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There they grow bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Manny?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's maybe a wrench or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is all the stuff you guys are
hunting through right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you just pulled.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my favorite plant right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of the closest to skunk that
has garlic in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the parents what made this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the key is actually that the super deep
fire is the parents that made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing without the garlic,
the super deep fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for that still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the mom plant or the clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Roger.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these is the Chinese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like noodles or.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cabbage, grease, the wonton wrapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you smoke it, it's kind of
orangey sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually super good when you smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a smell I've never smelled
in the weed world before ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got some zip locks right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I
[SPEAKER_01]: also made some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albert Walker garlic skunk seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to be epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also there's a Sharpie zip
locks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got plenty of stuff to throw your goods
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking to these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you need to make a like
whenever you're at an event and someone
[SPEAKER_02]: gives you a nug, just like something to
put it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be cool if they made these,
but they had little dividers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone gave you a nug, you could
slide that one in there and then you could
[SPEAKER_01]: keep your little nug separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: My big thing was just like the white,
like something like this, like white that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could write on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of sour to eat to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I try that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your bag and throw LG on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, your Ziploc right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad for an old and out of touch dude,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, it's I'm just making fun of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all sarcasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I laugh at all the it's funny to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jesus.
What's?
[SPEAKER_02]: Laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little one, but that's that 2012
white lemon 91 thin mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to try that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that gunpowder skunky candy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2012 was a strain I made in 2012 and it
was the white cross my lemon cost with 91
[SPEAKER_01]: chem and that's what I called 2012 because
it was 2012 and everybody thought the
[SPEAKER_01]: world was going to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, oh, I get to play off that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was 2012 white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2012 cross thin mints.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manic Calio number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's Manic Calio number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you were selecting through these,
what did you like about the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as it doesn't have that obnoxious
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you took some of the buds,
there's resin all over your hands,
[SPEAKER_01]: just caked with resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a nice clean little orange
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all from the last round.
Yeah.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different lines do you hunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manic Irene number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell that separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super like your hands are just caked with
powder resins all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some form, the original Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all smaller nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was this from a clone?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what would you do with something
like this in terms of the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, would you cross it with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hit it with the biscotti sherbert
and the lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are where we're going to grow
next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's some of the seeds that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is a Laughing Gas White Rhino
Manic that I made the round before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that wash well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they all do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most everything is pretty frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let me get some of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I feel like this is rosin wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Laughing Gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross with White Rhino Manic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Manic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Manic clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manic is some crazy clone that's similar
to OG and Chem, but it predates them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some punk rockers in Santa Barbara had
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only know of Oregon Kid had it and
loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Fletcher had it a long time ago and
did some breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not many other people have this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's very tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what are you most excited in terms
of expectations?
[SPEAKER_01]: All those seeds, all those in that tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had to pick one that you're most
excited about, one of your children that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're most excited about, about the
potential or most intrigued about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough because what I like and what
I'm making for them in the market are two
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's that biscotti sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty it's got some zap to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might be trying to find the
lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you smelled that one yet?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's number 275 popping gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it gets tough babysitting all
these strains, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like a teacher with 80 kids in the
class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to remember all their names,
what they eat, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then does stuff get kept for long
term?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you guys, you know, I'm thinking
if you're going for the commercial market,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like rotations, but then maybe
sometimes coming back to stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what all those moms are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point, you'd have like 800
moms because you keep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this one is better, then we have to
get rid of that one because this one is
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if whoever's like like a king of the
hill, whoever can stay at the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hill and push the other guy out,
then that person is out and we move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could just be like something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the only benefit to that was it's
all in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could always try to pull it back
because everything is backed up in seed
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything will be in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everything we see except for a
couple is all from seed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for some of the clones that I
wanted to do the pollinations with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a good example of laughing
gas, but that's the laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some more somewhere, but this is
one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you give it a good squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's got to be it's good because
everybody's using it right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's trying to tease it because
so many people have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because it's just good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's something that you that you
would love to introduce to the commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: market that the lemon or relevant of what
people currently like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm hoping is the lemon cherry gelato
on the Colombians might make something
[SPEAKER_01]: special because of the flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have something really old that's
Pirsativa with something that's extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: modern, pure indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually when you do the indica to sativa,
you get really good hybrid crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty anxious about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't bring any, but the gelalabad star
is amazingly crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good loud weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a cross of the lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this like the same Irene that's an
Irene Colombian from Cagu?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's it's clone only, and I think
he got it from he got it from Radio Ridge,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm pretty sure they're pretty
reputable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all around, this is really good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The garlic skunk I really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the number three, the number
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some manic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more downstairs, but here's some
of the previous rounds of all the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: we've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got about the same amount
downstairs in one of those rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So example, that's how I do the crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: RS-11, H-15, we put them in little jars
with the tags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, where is the RS-11?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mark the branches that I pollinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top is the plant that I pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottom is the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gets clipped on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Branch gets hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the seeds from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We harvest that branch and then pull out
the seeds and put them back on their jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Example, there's a lot more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some pollen takes a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants are a little more fertile than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross with lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is I get the whole punch and cut
a thing and then attach it to the branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, got it, got it, got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I look in there, I know where the
branch is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any plants are next to it and I see
seeds in there, I know what pollen it was
[SPEAKER_01]: because that tag is next to that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have any problems with cross
pollination or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just get to R&D all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep knocking them out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Use my knowledge and their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect those genetics, cross them,
and see what we get.
