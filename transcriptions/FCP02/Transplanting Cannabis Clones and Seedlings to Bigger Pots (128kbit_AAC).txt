[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so today I'm going to be sharing
with you the first of many tips,
[SPEAKER_00]: just little things that can save you time
or make your life a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may know these things already,
but for those of you who don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see it and you'll face palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of things that we
can do that save us a lot of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes life easier, that are common
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't know until you know,
so that's the point of these tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today what I'm going to do is show you
how to make transplanting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier on your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already started, we're going to be up
potting, and I've already started with a
[SPEAKER_00]: new bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're containers, they're pots,
they're whatever they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also pre-filled a little bit of
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you put your existing plant
and root ball in, you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's sitting at about the same
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might be able to bury a
little bit of stem if you need to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, we would typically be up
potting something with a decent size root
[SPEAKER_00]: ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure it has some extra
soil to go down into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave it exactly like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the nice height, good equal
distance all around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just start filling in the soil
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use, you know, a little tray
underneath, try to prevent it from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if you're on a concrete floor,
if you have a tarp, that makes life a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier and clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a broom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to keep filling it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the soil goes into the middle pot,
don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take advantage of that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're getting close to the top of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just smooth it out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to give it a little bit of a
push down, just gently kind of make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it binds against the side of the pot,
you know, solid wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to push it down too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to create compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good root zone needs oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just push it all down, you're not
doing yourself any favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go gently, but do get it a little
bit tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, looks good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all this stuff in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you not to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where it kind of comes in
handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it and you just scoop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take it to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of fills it in and brings
you to the level that you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice and simple there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's going to bring that to the
level that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy little pottery, potty pot pots,
happy little perlites and soil clouds for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to basically do is
give this a little twist and a shout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a perfect hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take your pot or your plant
out of here and you're going to plug it
[SPEAKER_00]: in, boom, you got something perfect to
plug it into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get our new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd plug it right in, maybe give it a
little bit more of a tamp down,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe put some extra topsoil on top of it,
give it a water and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we've covered the big pot,
we're going to do the little pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically my progress of potting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start all my clones,
all my seeds in a small four by four tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically will then move them up to a
gallon pot and finally into a three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, which for the size of the tents that
I'm growing in is really the maximum size
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could use larger pots, but I'm going to
get a lot larger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while larger plants sound great,
I don't necessarily want that because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount that I have and the space that
I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plug that back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to walk through this just
like we did the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to add some soil in the bottom
of the pot first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that that is a little too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when you put a seed in
there, it'll get a bit of a stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cotyledon, which is the very,
very little first leaf, not even really a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, but let's not get too technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stretch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes you can bury the stem up to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to take a little bit, back it out
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that actually looks like it's going to
be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a tighter fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this time, like I said last
time, if you spill the soil into that
[SPEAKER_00]: middle container, don't worry,
you'll use it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's fill it up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm just going to take the stuff
from the middle, fill the outsides and
[SPEAKER_00]: make it perfect to my heart's desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that looks like it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like the last time, little twist
and shout and pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got your perfect hole to put your
seedling in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear any tips you guys have,
and we will be doing this every show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you guys next time.
