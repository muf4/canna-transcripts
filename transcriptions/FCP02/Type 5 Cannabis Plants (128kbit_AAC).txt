[SPEAKER_00]: Travis, do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was quite curious what the
practical application of type five plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going for fiber?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going for seed production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just for the purpose of trialing and
being able to test as like a neutral
[SPEAKER_02]: almost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it's hard to say what the
practical application is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that they were selected out
of this Eastern European breeding program
[SPEAKER_01]: originally, and that was a result of very
strict THC thresholds on hemp production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal was just to kind of reduce all
cannabinoid production to try to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: total THC, because their threshold was
basically zero at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in modern applications,
there are some people who are talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about using hemp as like a hop alternative
to like flavor beer, which could be
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a really interesting kind of
control in medical studies, like clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, right, to have the same
background, but no cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's hard to say what like
actual practical applications there are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting, nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of using it almost as like
a hop alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming it was for seed production
coming from Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like am I mistaken with thinking that they
grow mostly over there for food,
[SPEAKER_02]: for seed as food?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm figuring if it was from like the
Eastern Bloc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it was mostly for like dual
purpose hemp grain and fiber production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were harvesting the fiber and the
grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had the one question of,
so the type five does not produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, but is there a gland there
or is it just bract and leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some scanning electron microscopy
of type five plants and compared them with
[SPEAKER_01]: type four and type three and other type
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like they do have the
glandular trichomes, but the heads where
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabinoids and terpenoids usually
are appear collapsed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of interesting for a few
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that they appear collapsed,
which is an interesting phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is that they're not
non-existent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like they had to inflate and
then collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a question of what were they
inflated with and at what point do they
[SPEAKER_01]: collapse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously in plants that produce
cannabinoids, they inflate and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that summarizes my and answers my
question really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting because when
Damon first mentioned it, that was where
[SPEAKER_00]: my head first went is like, okay,
no cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the trichome itself appear?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the head is collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are there any research papers that
we can look at on online to see something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that if we wanted to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we published a paper earlier this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at the impact or the role of
cannabinoids in defense against insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were looking at comparing type
three, four, and five plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some SEM images there which
showed the collapsed glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a nice paper by DeMeyer and
colleagues from 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2009 where they're discussing the
inheritance of this cannabinoid free
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they show that it's a single locus,
kind of recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have some nice SEM images that
show these kind of collapsed or very
[SPEAKER_01]: deformed trichomes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
