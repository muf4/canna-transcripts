[SPEAKER_01]: Yo everyone, I'm Pax of the Future and
we're here in OG is My Oxygen's glass
[SPEAKER_01]: studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up gang?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just feel super lucky because you
are indulging me in an idea that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to explore for a while,
which is like smoking the entire drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of people hit me
from a view perspective and ask about the
[SPEAKER_01]: drops in total and brands more than they
talk about any individual jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are sort of wanting,
yeah, more of a complete picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a way for us to show it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What better way to start off than Candido
Craft?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have rolled up two joints here of
the Candido Craft rainbow belts and
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Included in this video will be some
footage and time lapse of the flower as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the roll up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what the process was like
breaking the flower down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're excited to smoke these
with y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're super stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Candido's rainbow belts is something
they've had for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gained some popularity with,
but also the Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rainbow belt side of 2.0 or 3.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the rainbow belts back onto the
moon bow, but it definitely has really
[SPEAKER_01]: strong Z-terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We crushed the half ounce of this already.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Blueberry Z was a little bit more
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna be both of our first time
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, but like historically Candido has
for me been one of the top five growers
[SPEAKER_01]: since I first tried their stuff a little
bit over a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like the moon glow at that
point of being was called the moon dough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also rainbow belts and it was
all phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there was a really strong
Z-terp through line, incredibly clean
[SPEAKER_01]: organic burn and more potency than I get
from an average or a commercially grown
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also made waves with some like
funkier strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they had a shoreline skunk
that people really loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an OG that people really cared
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think limited amounts of that came
out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this current drop, but they're really
focusing on these flavors, which is why
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sick to get into both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you rolled them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start with the Blueberry Z
because we haven't tried that one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry Z and rainbow belts this batch,
both are super, super resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trim is the trim I would say is more
of an old school trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's leaf leftover, but it's coated in
sugary trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't quite show you guys how sticky it
is, but believe me, this has definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: been one of the tougher ones to roll up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were saying some of the stickiest
we've ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is some of the stickiest we've
ever rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which did you think was stickier as you
were rolling them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Blueberry Z was stickier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Blueberry Z is from Turpogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I think, an Emerald Cup 2022 qualm
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that it's Blueberry across to Z3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the drive-thru it almost tastes like
raspberries and cream, like a raspberry
[SPEAKER_01]: and cream yogurt or ice cream situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really berry forward, acidic and
sweet, but also super, almost milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like Froot Loops almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the kind of sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the milkiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely, definitely a lot of
Froot Loops flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smelled it, first thing opening the
jar, my initial reaction in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I said was that it smelled like
Froot Loops, which is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's August.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a glass studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we opened the jar, the room fucking
ruined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really smelled pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Blueberry Z more than the Rainbow
Gulls, I'd say, which is why I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope it just doesn't overpower our
palette, but I'm also really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: The homie Kushis did these jars,
and he's been really making me jealous as
[SPEAKER_01]: he smoked through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been sitting on the jars for a couple
of weeks wanting to find a way to make
[SPEAKER_01]: good content with them, but it feels like
people have really enjoyed this drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a big foam up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the homie Kushis,
talented graphic designer for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off-Rip, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lighting up nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't quite gotten the flavor yet
completely, but when you light a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes that can be part of the
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes when you first light a joint,
it can be hard to get the initial flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: until you've let the cherry cool down from
the ignition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like, yeah, it makes sense here
as the smoke is passing through the joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hotter the temperature, the more
vaporization will be of the volatile
[SPEAKER_01]: turbines, and the less you'll really get
to experience that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're huge advocates of letting the
cherry cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of the proper doggies guys
talk about that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there really is something to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is pretty true to the smell
after letting it chill and taking a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more drags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely getting a lot of that Froot
Loops flavor I described.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that milky creaminess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never much of a super sugar cereal
advocate, but the flavor is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: reminiscent of Froot Loops straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's transferring pretty well on the
first pulls of the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: After letting it cool off from the
ignition, I'm definitely getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a really defined berry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost tastes like an under-ripe
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't as much of the creaminess that
I noted in the aroma on the dry pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more almost just like an amplified
and more modern version of old-school
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you had told me that this was a
really great forward, great pass,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you know, I'd believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is all to say that it's really
delicious smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard that this one is really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this one, I mean, it tastes pretty
true to the smell so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice when those line up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you roll a really tight joint
filter-less, and I think that that also
[SPEAKER_01]: helps with cherry temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as I'm drawing, I'm really getting,
I don't know, it just tastes purple.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best I can explain it.
Super purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if more of that sort of Z3
Hindu-y tone would come through if it was
[SPEAKER_01]: combusted a little bit hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's definitely a good
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try with our next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to try it after the
first roto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I'm hogging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the Z notes are more reminiscent
of a blue sushi than they are straight
[SPEAKER_01]: skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to explain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has that latent funk in the background,
which the purple tones accentuate really
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really, really delicious smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The texture is a little bit, not to read
as a word, but volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't harsh, but it's similar to the
experience of smoking really, really
[SPEAKER_01]: turkey hash, where it leaves an effect on
the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely feel the turps when
they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the way this is rolled definitely
compliments it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to find out how the flavor is
doing after a few more pulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually getting back to this after
you smoked it, I'm getting more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and more of the funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first few hits were way more fruit
loops forward, and now it's starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: relax into the funky notes, the older
purpley notes, things I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of a mixed berry fruit by
the foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not purple in a great way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purple in a red-blue swirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's delicious though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think on par with the quality that
I'd expect from dandy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rolling this up, you do have to be
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stray leaf and material
that you'll want to pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe if you want your experience to
be more flavor forward, you have to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: stems, you have to remove leaf,
and anything that is not something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you think you want to smoke to get flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this in particular, you have to be
extra vigilant with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem like there was any water
leaf material on the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a lot of sugar leaf,
and it probably was left there
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did a good job preserving the trichomes
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, when I was rolling it up,
it was incredibly sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor was pretty true to the taste
we're getting as well, so the preservation
[SPEAKER_00]: through that method definitely works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a grower or a producer,
anyone who's going from A to B,
[SPEAKER_00]: A being you with the flour, B being the
person smoking it, it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider whether or not your customer
knows to remove that, or if they even want
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly that will affect the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's interesting because this is
so incredibly turpy and enjoyable to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the harvests were probably
upwards of 45 days ago, and it's wildly
[SPEAKER_01]: flavorful, which is sometimes something
that does degrade over time, and very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly with certain commercial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final thoughts on the blueberry Z is that
this is really what I'd expect from
[SPEAKER_01]: candida.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that once you do break down the
plant matter in a way that is swirlable
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've removed all the material,
it will simply burn too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a pleasant joint,
you get some of the finest weed on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's burning really nicely,
certainly not in an artificial bone white
[SPEAKER_01]: way, but it certainly is clean and there's
none of that background sort of carbonate
[SPEAKER_01]: core leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other flavors that you get when you
have a darker or more rustic ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor is really dead on for the
aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a berry turp and it's a good,
interesting water turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on top of it all, it's potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a little sillier than before we
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sort of more familiar with the
rainbow belts, and I think we can almost
[SPEAKER_01]: just say off the bat we don't enjoy the
rainbow belts as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into it and offer our thoughts,
but to give an honest reflection of or
[SPEAKER_01]: just an honest reaction to this,
this has been far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like this blueberry Z more than
I like the rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, the rainbow belts is good
and we'll spark it up and let you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, do you want to dry pull it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll do that and let you enjoy this
a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the dry pull, just off that first dry
pull right there, I was getting more old
[SPEAKER_00]: school funky flavors than I was straight Z
or straight belts as I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think this has been my
experience in the past, but I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: straight lemon heads off the dry pull,
which is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to really notice that,
but it's this sharp citric acid with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a yellow coloring to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's trade back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, spark that I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'll enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, getting that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old school flavor is more mothball-y,
more mothball-y, not in a bad way,
[SPEAKER_00]: more like in the perfume of the mothball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that lemoniness is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have that tart citric note.
[SPEAKER_01]: There definitely is a funk to the way that
they select, in particular, their work
[SPEAKER_01]: from archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dosi, even though it's so far back,
but on both sides with the rainbow belts
[SPEAKER_01]: and the moon bow, is a really dynamic,
almost nutty kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they, Candido in particular,
selects phenos of belts that are sure more
[SPEAKER_01]: of that kushy, nutty range as opposed to
that straight Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was straight hazelnut on the first
puff, which is interesting because right
[SPEAKER_00]: after combustion, as you light the joint,
you don't typically get a ton of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is leaning kind of like,
I don't know what you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like a rich nut or like a fatty
nut, like a hazelnut or a kind of chestnut
[SPEAKER_00]: almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the lemony citrus is starting to come
through, but I definitely think there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: chestnut undertones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent some time with a breeder who once
really advocated for the rainbow belts
[SPEAKER_01]: because he felt it had more of a defined
lemon-lime citrus tongue than Skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I really liked that
grapefruit, cardamom, just candy element
[SPEAKER_01]: of the original Skittles cut, but it's
interesting that lemon is something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more available in belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool that folks are finding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the first pull of that belt,
it's definitely lemon, definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: chestnuts or something funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I, you know, there's kind of,
yeah, it's like, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's creamy at first, but then it develops
into the kind of nutty, chestnutty type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like macadamia nut or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fatty, excuse the words I'm going to
describe this with, but it's like a fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mothball-y too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I didn't get mothball in the dry
fall, but I very much get into smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that it's a note that I
picked up on with previous ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the citrus had really stood out to
me, but I also think people maybe hadn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been breaking it down as meticulously as
you just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm enjoying this more than my previous
experiences with it, though it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think being honest is a big part of
what we're trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one does irritate my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes really turby strains will do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly really turby hash will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I sometimes steer clear of
fresh-fresh, particularly when it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus, limonium dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can give you the wasabi effect,
light your nose up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's less of this right now,
and maybe it was just also the extended
[SPEAKER_01]: jar care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I would have really leaned
into that comment based on my first jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is pleasant smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to try that one again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's interesting that there's
latent, like Pac said, from the dosie or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of latent funk to be found
in this genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hand this back to you,
but on the exhale, that time, there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: real sort of jet fuel cushiness,
and it was not present on the inhale,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was that expansive, almost like
sarsaparilla-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really, and I should just say the
thing that I'm thinking, it has that
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a cola gummy on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I associate that with some of the
darkest and strongest cushions when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: paired with a fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely getting the cola gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because that almost fits
as a overarching descriptor for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we described at first, because the
nuttiness, slash sarsaparilla,
[SPEAKER_00]: slash more deep kind of robust notes,
plus the light citrus that you actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdly enough, get if you bite into a
cola gummy, the first taste you get is the
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus, citric acid, and then immediately
it devolves into that cola sarsaparilla
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, and there's not much citrus left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the experience is very similar
with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm excited to be focusing on the
rainbow belts, but I will say around
[SPEAKER_01]: halfway through the joint, this has lost a
little bit of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still really enjoying it, but a lot of
the brighter quality and the sharper
[SPEAKER_01]: richer sort of buried tones have muted,
and it now is smoking kind of more like,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost what I associate with like an old
school blueberry, that kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not piney, but it's, to quote that
same reader, kind of fruit of the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm really leaning into the cola
gummy on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and like Pac said, it's a very
distinctly different experience than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other joints we've smoked through this
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we've smoked one or two per week of
these for the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the experience was definitely
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny, the only thing I can
think right now is that this is their,
[SPEAKER_01]: their jar of rainbow belts in particular,
and it is rainbow belts that we point out,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is back cross from rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being said, is less Z than their rainbow
selection, and it shows the range of
[SPEAKER_01]: variation of polyhybrids, and people sort
of assume based on these crosses that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to know what the drink
profile is, but there's so many potential
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive combinations that I do think
Candido has a rainbow that leads more
[SPEAKER_01]: skittles than their belts, and their belts
is kind of almost something entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this is still nice, but the flavor
has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing, you know, makes me want nothing
that makes me want to put it down or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just interesting always to kind of
think about how your flavor is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change throughout your joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is definitely funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, super funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit peppery, but in a
pleasant way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of that cardamom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not as much citrus as I had
experienced when it was fresher,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I think that really is worth noting
that, you know, those limonium turps are
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the most volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever else sort of contributes to those
citrus tones, and that it kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a bit of a jerk here, has tapered
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think it's gotten smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm enjoying smoking it more than I had
previously, which isn't to say that we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't enjoy the punch, it was in rotation
all the time, but it was always like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oof, like they're extending out a little
bit scratchy, and some of that's fallen
[SPEAKER_01]: off too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely marketably stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: than the Blueberry Z, and I think that
every time that we smoked this previously,
[SPEAKER_01]: it absolutely throttled me, and now that
it's been in rotation for about two
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds, the Blueberry Z was very
pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was certainly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got the job done, but this one is
stupefying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I don't like the flavor or the
combustion really as much, the effects are
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's ridiculously strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Blueberry Z was euphoric when
we first hit it, and then we lit this
[SPEAKER_00]: joint up, and immediately I got
ridiculously stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has little bits of confusion
and bits of, I don't know, just everything
[SPEAKER_01]: goes a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stonier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less euphoric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different strokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, by and large, my opinion of
Candido hasn't really changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the kind of thing that, when it's
available, I'm always going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm eager to try their other cultivars,
and I don't know if Rabobots, this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular Fino, is the kind of thing that
I'd gravitate towards again and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do think every time that Blueberry
is available, it's the kind of thing I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grab, because it's definitely
potent enough.
