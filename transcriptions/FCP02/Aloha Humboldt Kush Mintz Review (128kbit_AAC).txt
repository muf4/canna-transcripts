[SPEAKER_01]: what up future cannabis project we're here
with another strain review this time we
[SPEAKER_01]: have some kushments we're super stoked
about this we've already smoked it a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's fire for sure um grown by aloha
humble sun grown as we understand it
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor again um and again i think proving
that outdoor can be really really good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality definitely man i mean this stuff
does not disappoint the flavor is on point
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke is on point and just taking out
of the jar here i mean these these are big
[SPEAKER_00]: nugs they're not even wanting to come out
of the jar on their own gotta pull them
[SPEAKER_00]: out there we go um yeah just taking this
out here you can see really nice kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dark color on the kushments of course dude
yeah i mean it's sticky it smells good
[SPEAKER_00]: first smell is kind of like tea tree kind
of like mentholated almost uh with those
[SPEAKER_01]: of like kush funk totally no i agree with
everything you said there's a subtlety to
[SPEAKER_01]: the tea tree thing it's it's like
eucalyptus there's almost a seaweed smell
[SPEAKER_01]: to it and there's definitely a bit of a
funkiness it's kind of like aloe and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a bit of a fermented lactic funk
thing that has an age quality almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: bonito flakes definitely cracking open the
jar my first reaction was ultimately just
[SPEAKER_00]: bonito flake funk for those who don't know
what bonito flakes are it's a it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fish flake that's on japanese food it's
kind of smoky funky almost kind of cushy
[SPEAKER_01]: and delicious definitely like not a bad
funk super umami yeah um and the the
[SPEAKER_01]: texture of this is kind of crumbly it is
dried and cared very well again the
[SPEAKER_01]: sungrown buds are providing this really
great tactile element where it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a tackiness and there's like a
slick almost oiliness to the buds it is
[SPEAKER_01]: not just enormous swollen trichomes that
you could almost shake off it i mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky man it is very sticky breaking it
apart there's definitely some good
[SPEAKER_00]: well-grown resin on there my fingers are
sticky after having broken that down
[SPEAKER_00]: grinding it up too like when you shape it
into a joint it just it's really nice i
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it just shapes into that cone or
whatever shape you want it to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly without having to compact it
together and mess up your airflow too much
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ultimately just really really
pleasant flour to roll up and really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: to break down and that inner resin when
you craft the nug has more of that aloe
[SPEAKER_01]: freshness totally the more i smell this
the more i enjoy it and notice the nuances
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more typical of kushments yeah i
mean like having you know smoked probably
[SPEAKER_00]: two joints before this video uh well done
sungrown outdoor and greenhouse cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to uh peter at future cannabis
project it's a nice joint already burned
[SPEAKER_01]: in one white yeah i think that the smoke
on this is what is most impressive we we
[SPEAKER_01]: went through the nose and the appearance
but i i don't think those would be this
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily the standout qualities that
i'd highlight it's the smoke on this that
[SPEAKER_01]: is so wonderful yeah it smokes super super
well a resin ring begins to form instantly
[SPEAKER_01]: like you said the ash is clean which not
the bl end all but in negative of a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy grow environment for sure totally
i mean yeah i don't know i like to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: white ash it might not mean anything who
knows it might mean everything but i like
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it um and a lot of good stuff
usually has it um man this stuff is just
[SPEAKER_00]: really delightful you know we're just
breaking into another joint here and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: uh it's got very like kind of stupefying
effects almost but it doesn't sedate you
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes you want to like get up and like
have fun or do something you know do
[SPEAKER_00]: something active it's stoner movie weed it
makes me like you know i feel the pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: here but it makes me want to like kind of
like squeeze my eyes together and like
[SPEAKER_01]: just like smoke a bunch this joint would
rival a lot of the best stuff on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market totally and it's really strong yeah
i like this i i think it's best suited for
[SPEAKER_01]: evening use because it has some woozy
qualities but that does speak to a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good product yeah definitely i agree this
stuff is really really good it does have
[SPEAKER_01]: that bubba in the smoke there's that sweet
quality um there definitely is it is
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter than some of the super potent
mentholated strains that are being you
[SPEAKER_01]: know distributed right now and are equally
interesting but this does have a softer
[SPEAKER_00]: more organic touch shout out to aloha
humboldt and peter from future cannabis
