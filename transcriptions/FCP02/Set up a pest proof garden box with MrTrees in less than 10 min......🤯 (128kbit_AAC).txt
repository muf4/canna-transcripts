[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, Tyler, Mr. Trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're setting up a little garden
vegetable box and wanted to give a little
[SPEAKER_01]: tip on slug and snail prevention as well
as other bugs and stuff and show you kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of what I do to set up a little mini
garden box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first things first, I get my box,
I get things planted, seeds put in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to get it covered up and I
want to get it protected, put a barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always set up some copper tape
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper is... What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing your thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So copper actually interferes with the...
Yeah, that's you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocking and rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So copper actually interferes with the
slime of slugs and snails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them this electric shock or
charge as they get near it and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: cross over it, kind of like an electric
fence for a dog or a cattle or chickens or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gives them that kind of jolt,
pisses them off just enough to send them
[SPEAKER_01]: the other direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't kill them, doesn't hurt them,
just kind of lets them know that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not allowed to go in this little area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to reapply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to buy anything new.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use any types of
products and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, you're just sticking and
forgetting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your slug and snail free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the copper tape comes from a lot of the
different nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do all kinds of stuff,
but you just get a roll of this little
[SPEAKER_01]: tape here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper on one side and it's a sticky
backside here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just peel it off slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then usually on the top of a garden
box or around any rim of any pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put it around anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will stick to most anything,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as a slug or a snail tries to
pass over it, they will not be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just run this around the entire top
rim or bottom rim or whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you ensure,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little extra ladder there for them
[SPEAKER_01]: around this whole box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it breaks off like it just did,
just tape it back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start working it all the way
around the entirety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're done, it breaks off super
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuck it in the roll and we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This box is now super protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can go around and you want to
press it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that you've got it
stuck on there nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do some reinforcing of,
you know, various kinds to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it sticks perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's essentially all you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to reapply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough to piss off anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, slugs and snails are taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, we get some PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the edges of all corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We push it down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: About, you know, a foot, foot and a half
to two feet usually is where I start
[SPEAKER_01]: setting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every foot and a half, two feet in the
ground it goes.
Boom.
Two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that as best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab yourself another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stacked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab yourself another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just do this for however long your
box or bed is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically you're building a little tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little hoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't even have to be crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or super secured unless you're in a real
windy area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can, you can pound these in
and make them really loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Demonstration purposes, we don't need to
do anything crazy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get my favorite thing in the
world, mosquito netting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blocks out most pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if this piece is going to
be big enough, but I got lots of other
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically you get yourself a piece that's
going to cover your box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order it online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it at fabric stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you basically cover, cover up your
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw a couple of bricks or
something on here to keep this down so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get in and out of it easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bang, you got yourself a vegetable
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: 95% of pests, they're not going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing can get there through the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing can kind of get through on the
underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in great shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of take extra precautions and
tuck this around your tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really make it nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to throw it out there
just quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took us just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done and over with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can walk away and not really worry much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler, Mr. Trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw your comments or questions down
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if we can get to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my best to touch everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got ideas or questions,
just hammer them at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care of each other.
Bye.
