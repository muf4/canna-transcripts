[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go inside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gemma, we're going to do a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we start up here and then you
can get to the pond story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the Connecticut Rhode Island
border and we are on 30 acres of woodland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Japanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invasive Japanese beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Japanese beetles that Gemma is
going to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma's in charge of, she's the Grim
Reaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the house that is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from 1802.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original house.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our perennial flower gardens going
on around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you put all these in recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, these were here but the issue was
that, so we got this two and a half years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, the issue was that the person we got
it from was very old and was all by
[SPEAKER_00]: herself and hadn't been able to take care
of anything for about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had just an insane amount of
invasives that we've been clearing out
[SPEAKER_00]: such as multiflora rose and oriental
bittersweet and other things that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty and overwhelmed stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've just been trying to fight
that back which we have pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: succeeded around here and have discovered
stuff like, if you give this a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a mint?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lemon balm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like randomly we discovered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nice, it's just elderberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll harvest the berry and make jams
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can make like, isn't there a
yeast that grows on the outside of these?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can make like, you can jar it
up and then it ferments and creates a
[SPEAKER_01]: sparkling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I do not know, but I will look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the box hedges were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, this whole thing was just a
crazy mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually been very cool to watch
it from kind of April, May onwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it all dies back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little woody stuff that stays up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of like big mud patches
coming through the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a couple of these sort of
giant hostas which are pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that we're going to
tackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is burning bush, which is just
everywhere and grows everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it invasive?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful, but it's invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to have it for privacy from
the very well traveled dirt road out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invasive means that, oh, this plant here,
this is a burning bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns a fiery red in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so our current thinking is that we're
going to replace these with something
[SPEAKER_00]: called mock orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a dragonfly probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of different cool species
of dragonflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but anyway, it's a lovely little spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grape here is a Concord grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you excited?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you eat them last year or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're totally tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to bring it down and
probably train.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started training it along that the wall
chain link chain link.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moths usually, I think, come out more in
the late twilight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a bunch of Concord grapes,
and then we just have a lot of wild
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of figuring out between the
two because the wild grapes are just like
[SPEAKER_00]: a big seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mildly tasty, but with a lot of seeds to
spit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I can give you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a whole bunch of Keoho grapes
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one has, I think, like one seed
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to get various cultivars
because wherever there were just there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever we see wherever we see wild
grapes growing and stuff, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we know grapes grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean every cultivar will grow
here, but we know it's grape friendly and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can bring in some cultivars and sort of
pick and choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a giant grapevine Gemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all burning bush and it pops up
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this keeps the erosion control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like before removing it,
it's like, what would we put in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me show you the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can tell you, you had a
question about the pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the funny thing was the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see that, what's all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this was this was going to be,
look, these are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they were making love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're making this was going to be
cilantro.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, they don't bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't bite Gemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was going to be cilantro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put the stuff in and instead we're
getting a melon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, if you look at this railing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this house was 1802.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have plumbing in 1802.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this little thing right here is that
looks like a pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: About two years, two summers ago,
there was a big drought and the water had
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped running through and we wanted to
scrub it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't get around to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they kind of made it so it would
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we need to hop in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so this part of the pond they
dug out and the stream that comes in is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right hand side there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, I got rid of it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Michael, with his bare hands,
removed all the poison ivy and developed a
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you call it when you no longer get
immunity and immunity to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this little pump that draws
from the pond and waters everything up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these guys here are the wild
grapes that are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by so this was a wild grape vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't come down yet, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm starting to punch into here
because we want to reclaim this if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just see how dense it is.
Tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these tomatoes were from the compost
bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened up the bin and there were a
bunch of tomatoes growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured instead of just tossing
them, we'll see what happens right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is this probably store bought
tomatoes and they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know what that is, but they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was wondering if it was like
some GMO tomato that only fruits once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's it's coming out and I don't
really care if the animals get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get to it first, we'll get to it
if not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is kind of what this is what that
flower garden look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just binds over everything, binds over
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's you know, this is a grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you start putting your hands
in, it gets very prickery and with the
[SPEAKER_00]: multiflora rose here we've put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this spot here was a big jungle
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cleared it out and we have put in some
little baby cherry trees, cherry tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for context, the ultimate goal is an
orchard for seasonal fruits for white
[SPEAKER_00]: mustache yogurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and this is more this area is this
more kind of you get the vibe that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there's fruit growing because we want
to do everything back where everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have cherry tree, cherry tree,
cherry tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a black cherry that was originally
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see if once we have cherries
around it, if that will actually fruit the
[SPEAKER_00]: black cherry over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just actually that's a wing of
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a plum over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one that's fenced in is a plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of this is just native
blackberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut it all down, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all has popped up since the
springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figure, you know, see how they
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of thornless blackberry
that I've planted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a pain in the butt to try to
if you were like, I'm going to harvest all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this for jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just grows dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at how kind of prickly it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the blackberries taste decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you get your child labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got two kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got nieces and nephews.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the issues is that it's a bramble
and it will just kind of it just pops up
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's trying to how do you kind of
contain it in one area, which is just sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of keep on chopping where it's sprouting
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of this high bush
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the season has come and gone,
but it has little tiny blueberries that
[SPEAKER_00]: were tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's high bush blueberry,
high bush blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've planted these have big
bulbous blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in two years, that'll grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pear tree, pear tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two pears, pear and pear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down here is
[SPEAKER_00]: persimmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is persimmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a yurt style tent that I got for
Father's Day?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do a sleepover in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go check out the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go check out the tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all going to go on the ground
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is apricot, Persian mulberry,
which is different than our North American
[SPEAKER_00]: mulberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in here, Homa's dad brought these
from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a hardy pomegranate from
Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can handle the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't tell anybody, but he smuggled it
in from Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did not declare it in his customs forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grew them in Orange County, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he brought them over here like
six weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They totally died off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at them coming back to life,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're bringing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kill that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little inchworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is going to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a cricket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have pomegranate fig that he's
brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have Persian mulberry,
which is the mulberry that... Sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one is Persian mulberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hardy almond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these guys over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The little ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, our hardy almond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going to happen in the fall is
we're going to take out a bunch of trees
[SPEAKER_00]: on this side and create space for these to
kind of go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the... Yeah, I see the
underbrush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've started clearing out the
multiflora rose because you can't cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the rose goes like way up high into
the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before cutting down the trees,
kind of get out all the stuff that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, take off your shoes, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's blow up mattresses that are not
currently blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Michael, of all these safe places,
you could have put those cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in that fenced in area?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were next to it with like,
I'm going to come and open up the fencing
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is...
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gemma here is from the mean streets of
Los Angeles and is just getting her
[SPEAKER_00]: country legs on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma is spooked by every, everything,
every bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, that spider is going to eat all
the... That's a good guy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That little spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like our spiders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to look in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take off, just step in,
take off your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add whether you want to come out here and
do a sleepover, although it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: rain for the next three days.
It's too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, during the day it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night time, you go to the fire pit,
you make a fire, you eat s'mores,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you come back out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fireflies everywhere,
which is pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a fireworks display.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you cozy up in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fireflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you got to come spend the
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're not going to do it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have to hack through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like this area, tons of grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to clear it out and then put
grape cultivars in and do it like proper
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of vineyard style.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should run naked through the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one, we're in tick country,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two, it's all thorns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of like... Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Japanese barber, we have a
ton of that, and that is like ground zero
[SPEAKER_00]: for ticks because it's a prickly bushy
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ticks go from the deer to little
rodents like mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mice hide in the Japanese
barberry because it's like safe from
[SPEAKER_00]: predators there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ticks climb up and wait for
the deer to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know, wait for people to come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim, no, we're going on a tour and then
we'll...
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a little bit of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now we're going in the shade,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut down a bunch of trees here and
we'll kind of clear out the ground because
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll line some tree crops up on that
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few more of these trees are coming
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm waiting for the foliage to leave
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, we planted bare root
raspberry that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's funny with the bare root
raspberry, if you come, so they're coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and with the mulch for each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have our garden vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that happens in my yard all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there's one, here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of this stuff is invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the multiflora rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to come through and I have
something to yank this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or bring in little push tiller to kind of
go around because I want to kind of feed
[SPEAKER_00]: out the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's our firm strategy up here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I go stand in the shade right
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be much cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be much easier for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built, I did some trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these are getting nice and big.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are raspberry too?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's raspberry, raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 20 of them on that side and
that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are little mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the weird worms called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The invasive ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget their real name, but it's like a
jumping worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like twice as thick and about
twice as long as your regular earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you touch them, like a regular
earthworm would be like, Ooh, get away
[SPEAKER_00]: from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these ones like spring up and like
land some places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen as many this year as I saw
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I feel like they like owned.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a high bush blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so I've been doing trails
through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll, we'll do a lot of undershoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Story stuff here in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that's pretty
interesting, I find interesting is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll show it to you when we get there,
is we have a lot of what's called hillside
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, which we'll start to fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give it a little bit of sun,
not so much sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the canopy is too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll take out some trees and get some
sun down onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stone walls here are back in the
19th century through the early 20th
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was livestock farm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the holding pens for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael, alpaca would be very happy in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the first one I'm going to
work on and turn it into like,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, it'll be like, eventually we'll
do like a dining room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you come up and you have
your, your eating in the woods and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically just kind of thoughtfully
plant around it, both kind of woodland
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals and food crop, whatever grows
in the shade, such as your, what was your
[SPEAKER_00]: shade tobacco?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Connecticut shade tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think would enjoy being grown in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have plenty of shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partial sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this, what we're walking on all
was like that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've made, started doing a trail
system through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do a tree house and zip line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip line from, because we have a couple of
really nice rock outcroppings that are up
[SPEAKER_00]: on a hill all the way down to drop into
the pond for your bath time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do some swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent actually is going to go way back
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to build a platform for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the one that Gemma was just in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that Gemma was just in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggested sneakers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there
[SPEAKER_00]: are lots of little micro climates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a Oak Hickory woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is technically an Oak Hickory
Savannah, which I think is a funny name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I think of Savannah,
I think of giant African planes or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, we're walking up through the
middle of the property and just watch
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're, even though it's clear,
you still got to watch where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what uncle Michael's wearing on
his feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so this stuff that you see
here, this is hillside blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see like, and it's kind of
late, but you'll see a couple of little
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries, but supposedly if,
and we have a ton of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supposedly if you get at least a
little bit of sun on it, they start to
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and, and it's kind of do it in,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Oak trees kind of go bonkers with
their acorns every two or three years to
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wildlife kind of just defeat with
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll make a hillside blueberry
jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Maine orchard is generally going to be
where?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to walk down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: See on the ground there, Gemma,
see how there's that Brown strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably a log there that I
moved when I was making this path.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get some, some, uh, alcohol to dry
it out at CBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, it's probably from the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you do Gemma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what we did with
Valentina's ears when she was complaining
[SPEAKER_01]: that her ears hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dries out the water that's in your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a rubbing alcohol, not a
drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so this is the blueberry, the hillside
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stuff's getting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are some patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously there's just so much,
there's a tree blight on a beach trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of these are beach, but there's a
bunch of blight in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, you see so much dead stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so it's just kind of over the
years, thin out all the stuff that's dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: take out some of the bigger trees,
let some of the smaller ones grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll start bringing some light down
onto the ground here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the trail system was sort of to
help me see what's back here and to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: around in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gemma here's some good spots for a zip
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't quite have bungee jumping,
but, uh, but we do have some perches that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could do some zip lines on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we'll go over to that one over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so your cousins like to climb on these
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, cleaned off this one from all the
prickers and stuff that were on it
[SPEAKER_00]: so that, uh, so that it was safe for a six
year old and a four year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they like to climb on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This big one right over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took off, um, there's, there was just
like a bunch of fallen branches that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could slide on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, um, green briar, which is a
prickery type of thing, native,
[SPEAKER_00]: but got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then, uh, I brought them out here
and they spent a good two hours climbing
[SPEAKER_00]: over this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab, grab the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready?
Gemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got to scramble up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so step up to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step up to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can find a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go, you can go up this way then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow me right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now step up there right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: My God, Gemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think of, uh, if you had a
zip line from here, would this work,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma down for the city girls,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a little escalator, solar powered
escalator elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of bring you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we did a zip line down that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could do a tree house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come and help build it,
we can do all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do some platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do a play in the woods,
make a little stage out here, zip line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you kind of have to move yourself
along your jump down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That over there is a big stand of mountain
coral, uh, which is pretty when it blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get you some stuff at
CVS to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be some wax as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably water, uh, from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we'll go down this way and then
I'll show you where we're going to do the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow uncle Mikey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma, I'm in flip flops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then ultimately a house, you'd want to
put where somewhere up over in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much further back does the
property go?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of dead center of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably like four or five acres in that
direction and four or five acres in the
[SPEAKER_00]: other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so 800 yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this may be another, four or 300
yards that way to the end of the property
[SPEAKER_00]: after the mountain Laurel is, um,
is, uh, the stone wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other side of the
property, uh, the federal fish and
[SPEAKER_00]: wildlife bought that because they're doing
a study on flora and fauna and coastal
[SPEAKER_03]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you jump off the road?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock down to a trampoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could do a net like a circus net,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold your hand as you step down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step, step, step
[SPEAKER_01]: acorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Gemma, we could whistle into the
acorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you looking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I don't know, but not Gemma.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not a tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow me this way and then up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good uncle, Mikey,
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco Polo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we find each other in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a little walkie talkies for
fun to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncle Michael is going to show you how he
whistles with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good cap?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't done this in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to probably get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Gemma, you're going to master.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I used to do that when I was your
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably one of the last times I
did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look here, there's a stone wall
that shoots down that way, comes across
[SPEAKER_00]: here and then on that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the first area of future
orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this area right here, this area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, it's going to be,
it's a woodland orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be kind of like we have
a big open field and start planting trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll take down a ton of this,
leave some of the existing trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, we're in
Connecticut in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of, lots of rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of plant your stuff all through
here, um, where you can, but maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks provide nice minerals, mineral
treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it'll be, um, uh, a lot of peach
probably, and a lot of quints,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is probably the two main things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, then I've also, um, uh,
uh, some guy that I follow on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media, uh, sent me a bunch of persimmon
seeds that I've started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they're like this big,
uh, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, then I've also started from last
year's, um, peach jam batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was these Jersey peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a feather, these Jersey peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've started those and that type of
thing is, uh, there's this guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Shepherd, who talks about the stun
method, which is sheer total utter
[SPEAKER_00]: neglect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm growing those and I will just
stick them in the woods somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them kind of a happy home and just
like see if, see if they grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and how they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll let, I'll do that when they're
like two years old, give them a fighting
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but this will be cultivated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, our big issue is figuring out how to
get, uh, some larger machines in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that pond has a brook that runs
across the front of the property and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't, and we only have a footpath to get
over the brook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we have to either build a bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, didn't I send you those like pontoon
bridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well we had this one guy come and,
uh, he's like, I could clear this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's like the issue because we would
keep all of the, the, uh, chipped trees
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, um, and just use the,
the wood, the, we would just use the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wood clippings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, but his machine, which is one
of those giant things that like comes down
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree and just like grinds it down,
like cuts it like flesh with the earth is
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he said it was 70 tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we are going to petition the fish
and wildlife if we can get a access from
[SPEAKER_00]: their side and coming through the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so is there a road?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a little access road,
uh, but we would then have to kind of cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down 25 yards of trees like this,
um, on the fish and wildlife, fish and
[SPEAKER_00]: wildlife side to come on in or like 20
yards, uh, archeological discovery
[SPEAKER_00]: glasses, old bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our archeological discovery
from whenever, however many years ago.
Uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then these things are interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have them kind of all over the
property and, uh, one of my neighbors gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me a book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one pound beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a neighbor gave me a book on,
um, indigenous ceremonial, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of rock formations and not saying it
is, but we have a bunch of it when very
[SPEAKER_00]: well could be, um, from hundreds of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie, you want to see where the chickens
are going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nice size animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the some poop, some animal poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gemma, slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma, what are you doing in Los Angeles
when you see bugs or are there no bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like roly polys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like lady bugs and roly polys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when you were three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carolina likes snails.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were three or four, your dad got
a bunch of lady bugs and you were the
[SPEAKER_00]: official lady bug keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was probably built when?
[SPEAKER_00]: This early 20th century, like 1920s,
1930s.
Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: hold that open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably a little spot as
you're letting your cow and sheep graze
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just need a little hangout spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have the candle thing above you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a hundred years, maybe 90 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fireplace works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, it was just kind of, uh,
a spot to hang out as your cows were busy
[SPEAKER_00]: eating and your sheep were busy eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you could make yourself a cup of tea
or a coffee or a stew or stew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the original ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like a hundred years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma, should we make some tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll clean, we'll clean them out one of
these days.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we're not throwing that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to clean off these tables and,
and make it a nice little spot to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overlooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, uh, this right here was just a
mess of invasive stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cleaned it out and there's clover
growing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fenced in area, saffron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how's the saffron doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so actually we need to give it a good
weeding, uh, and give it space to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so where are those little?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one's the saffron?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dies back and then it emerges in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically where you see the pink,
uh, little stakes, uh, that's the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three or four rows and we're
just doing a test to see how it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if it grows well, we'll plant more
saffron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down here Gemma is where the chicken
coop will go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning out space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have chicken coop with little
chickens and you'll be eating the chicken
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs when you visit next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chicken shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, we're going to have egg chickens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to probably get little
chicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the eggs hatch and turn in the
chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they give birth to, uh,
you get your rooster and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: um,
[SPEAKER_00]: so more blueberry, blueberry blueberry
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's all that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side of that stone wall,
which I haven't even barely even touched
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma, you survived a walk in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go inside and take down a grow
tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, here, smell this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crush that and smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one is a different type of
mint and this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more like a spearmint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a spearmint.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one, I don't know which one that
I forget which one is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's a good one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's like a spearmint.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also like those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to like, you know,
it's like plant rhubarb in places and
[SPEAKER_00]: echinacea in places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of foraging opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you might not need it every season or
every year, but you know where you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: find it when you need it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So berms and, uh, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your vision for water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when it rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is bring up here to holding tanks
and then feed it that way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm saying when it rains to try
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have mad flooding, uh, issues here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've witnessed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, which is either the soil is
so compacted or the bedrock is only like a
[SPEAKER_00]: limited amount of space underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but we will do, um, that side is worse
cause there's a giant rock face over there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just comes down and we're going to
do, um, uh, uh, berm and swales over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then kind of just an initial one
just, and then as we start needing water,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of branch, branch things out,
um, water comes down here, not as bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this could end up being some sort of
like holding pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I would like to see if I could do,
um, uh, grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're not mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a rice patty, but yeah, it comes
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you, yeah, you were here when this
was just all mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, um, this also when the water was
just like going right over the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, this spring, like in March,
like the average March rain around here is
[SPEAKER_00]: three inches and we had something like 14
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water was all up in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I remember it's coming down that way
and then the pond itself is overflowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so basically this is what you would
need to get heavy equipment over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, but it goes down this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it goes down this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if we did do some sort of what,
like pontoon bridge, it would be down over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then that's a matter of talking
with, uh, with folk about doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you could get just a,
like a regular Kubota tractor over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do like a small little excavator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to get a little small
excavator, but like, uh, like the Kubota
[SPEAKER_01]: we had growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could get one of those over
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I'm talking back where we want to
do the orchard where it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had like a big excavation,
like one, it's not wide enough to come
[SPEAKER_00]: over, but there are fish in here and
turtles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's turtles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I saw a big giant turtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ducks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a family of geese this spring,
which was really cute with little baby
[SPEAKER_00]: goslings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ducks live somewhere right in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally you see them pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're not in the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come in the pond, if you come to
the pond side, and then you might see our,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a great blue heron that hangs out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bird about yay tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about your height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, it doesn't let you get close.
Uh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically if you either stare at the
water here or go to that little bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: over there, you'll see some fish poking
around every so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, those are peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, those are the peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those are the, um, these are the ones
that James is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then this is a hearty banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found, I found this, uh, uh,
this spring and, uh, this area floods and
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, you found it where you bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a local, it wasn't just wildly growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a, um, uh, I was at a native
nurse or I was at a nursery, not a native
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw it as from Japan and I was like,
that looks like a banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a hearty banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're in zone six, rapidly turning into
your zone seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were in zone eight,
you would actually get little bananas on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, unless you put it in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have it in the ground and basically
each fall you cut it down to about here
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it just go, uh, goes dormant in
the winter and then pops back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put in two, one here, one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then this is funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a willow that probably fell 30
years ago or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was clearing out this area,
I chopped a bunch of branches from it that
[SPEAKER_00]: were coming off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this willow is still growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's some roots somewhere with
some little vein that comes through,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is the willow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't go in that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got sealed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, there's so many of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the spotted lantern fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't made it up here yet,
but, uh, I've been following it's in like
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairfield County down towards New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, at Naheed's house in
Brooklyn, last summer, you saw them?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they're slowly making their way
North.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dragon lily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it has it's like little thing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is, so I have a couple of these
at, uh, at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the false indigo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want these pods, like you take them
off and, um, and, uh, like the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a very pretty, uh, ornamental.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, what I was thinking is like,
if you had a dump truck of spent barley,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, theoretically they, we could like,
just let it go back that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things I was thinking,
so the big issue for having events here is
[SPEAKER_00]: limited parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have three acres over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, what I was thinking of doing is,
uh, just like taking out the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: grading it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a, there's a stream back
there, but basically having this area here
[SPEAKER_00]: where when you need it, you could park 30
or 40 cars.
Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying is if, Oh,
and so then you could also just dump your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, I think, uh, there's a,
there's a spirits company and a beer
[SPEAKER_00]: company that would have both kind of said,
yeah, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a whaler brewing keeps calling me
asking, they're like, do you want to come
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday with a dump truck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I, like, I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I just don't feel like having a
giant pile here where I'm like with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny wheelbarrow, but you could
leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have a big pile of,
I mean, it starts to, uh, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, it doesn't get stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it's like, this is the front of a
beautiful house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we put in some blueberry and
blackberry here, some sage, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just letting like this here was basically
looks like that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which some of that is little native
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other of it is, uh, the multiflora rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the multiflora rose hanging
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that bind?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pain in the ass to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, what I'd love, I mean,
I'd love to do it if it could just be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit further, but if I had like,
there's four of us ready to move it around
[SPEAKER_00]: the property, it's like dump it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's why I was thinking of the
truck backed up here, put it's and just
[SPEAKER_01]: dumped it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can leave it over the winter and just
let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one load.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see, are there any
issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I take another load?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, there's no downside to
having one load of stuff decomposing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back where I said we're going to put the
chickens is also where we want to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's also where it'd be awesome
where it's like, yeah, I can get just a
[SPEAKER_00]: big truck to drive over there and dump it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next event is the summer sweets party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
