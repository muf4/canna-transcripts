[SPEAKER_01]: What's up FCP community?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Lobster Fam Farms here,
going to go through my process of how I
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest for fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one thing to take into consideration
before you start harvesting a large amount
[SPEAKER_01]: for fresh frozen, you want to do at least
some small amount of testing to know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be happy with the quality
or with the yield of the material you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think it's going to dump and
you're going to have a winner,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's better to be safe and do a test
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now my buddy, who's a hash wizard,
he tested this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Hella Jelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like it wasn't quite to the
yield that we'd typically be looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the quality was really, really good
and unique where we're going to run it at
[SPEAKER_01]: least once and see what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he described it as some grape soda,
kind of grape jelly turps, and it sounded
[SPEAKER_01]: real fun and uncommon for what's available
and sold to us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a couple ways to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm far from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an expert on this, but from what
I've seen, you put X amount of grams into
[SPEAKER_01]: a mason jar with ice, give it a vigorous
shake for X amount of time, and then kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of just visually inspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want to see something along a
disco ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite sure how to judge the
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more so on this side of the process,
just getting it to be frozen, but a more
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced and new way to check is a device
called the resin dial from dudes simply
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really seems like a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure on the price of them,
but I would definitely look into it if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to try to commit a large
batch to fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this way you could have some solid
data before you proceed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that you will need, an ice cold
freezer, two if possible, a pair of clean
[SPEAKER_01]: sharp scissors, a clean work area,
packages to put your material in,
[SPEAKER_01]: a marker to clearly label your packages,
and a scale to measure your weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more things to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to be harvesting the whole
plant for fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to be taking the tops for
flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to be able to move the entire
plant to our workspace?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we going to have to take branches
or little pieces up to the workspace to
[SPEAKER_01]: work on individually?
[SPEAKER_01]: These all have advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I know that this isn't the highest
yielding, I took most of the tops for
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then let the bottoms bulk up for another
week so they got to crank on some more
[SPEAKER_01]: weight and really put on some more resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I would have to bring these up
branch by branch, which isn't ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like whatever container you
put them in or however you transport them,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the weight of the flowers themselves
and the little microclimate that they
[SPEAKER_01]: might create and start degrading the resin
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So situationally, I was able to bring
these up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to the work area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is where it becomes a little bit
more of an art than a science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of us can agree that you want
to touch the flower as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to use the stem as the only
way to kind of maneuver it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to start by getting most of the big
leaves off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you can kind of assess the rest of
the flower from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now each genetic and each person's
preference is going to dictate that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just my style for this genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see on the underneath,
there's a good amount of resin there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll want to check underneath as well
as don't just look on the top and think,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, that leaf looks bare because it might
be coated underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, for this genetic, it's going to
end up looking something about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring it over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some techniques where people
will have a stainless steel table and then
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of use a magnet to drop the material
onto there as they're booking it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: My situation doesn't allow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I prefer to use an aluminum turkey tray
because aluminum has a slightly negative
[SPEAKER_01]: static electrical charge and it kind of
makes the resin not want to stick there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to keep booking it down until
you get to your desired weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to keep track.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like kind of what percentage
you're getting, if that matters to you at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to measure them in pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep going branch by
branch until I get to a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you guys in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to our desired weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many different containers you can
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like turkey bags so it can
breathe a little, some like a half gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just out of convenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer a vac seal bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get it in there as gently as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll put it in the first freezer
about an hour or so before it goes into
[SPEAKER_01]: the main freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thought process behind that is to not
have it be room temperature or too warm
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's going in the second freezer,
the long-term storage so that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: making the motor in the freezer have to
flux up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like giving little warm
pockets to other units that are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you put a warm unit on top of a
frozen one, it might just kind of change
[SPEAKER_01]: the temperature inside the other turkey
bag and give some moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to start seal them, start them
in one freezer for an hour and then move
[SPEAKER_01]: them to long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our amount weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our vac seal bag clearly labeled
because it's hard to tell after they're
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen and it's easier for whoever's going
to make it, whether that be you or someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it in there as gently as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to suck just a little bit of the
air out but not squish it at all and then
[SPEAKER_01]: seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take out our last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we did about an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the second new one in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last step on my part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take the one that's been in
the first freezer for an hour and then put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the long-term freezer until I get it
over to the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my duties are essentially done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out through some of the
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone out there can enjoy fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to you Future Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
See you next time.
