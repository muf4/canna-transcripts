Welcome to MCR Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grant Hill, the business development
manager here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited to give you a little idea of
what we're doing in our happy little house
[SPEAKER_03]: here up in Gardner, Maine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we get scanned in and hop
right back.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Behind the scenes tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Howdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to MCR Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our little home here in Gardner,
Maine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting in this first little room,
what we have is all of our information
[SPEAKER_03]: technology for data analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then over here are a little schedule
for internal lab jazz, stuff to be
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got this new thermocycler in,
which we're very excited about for hop
[SPEAKER_03]: late and then sex testing, which should be
available within the month.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's going on in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we move on into the lab, we have this
nice little setup, our fancy little den.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a bunch of centrifuges over there
for sample prep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as things come into the lab,
to walk you kind of one by one through it,
[SPEAKER_03]: we come in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our sample prep room, the weight
rope room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So samples get stored in these security
containers that are brought over to these
[SPEAKER_03]: stations to be weighed out and prepped out
for their subsequent tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as those move along, they come out to
the bench where they're then prepped by
[SPEAKER_03]: our awesome lab analysts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we go along here, we have the
HDLC, which is what you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: running all of, or what we are running all
of our cannabinoid tests on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run a 19-medals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so that's this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything runs live over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so along with the heavy metals
testing that we carry out on the ICP-MS,
[SPEAKER_01]: we also run plant nutrient analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really great tool for a grower
to diagnose problems with their plant
[SPEAKER_01]: before they become apparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of really highly skilled growers
know exactly what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're looking at their plant,
they can say, oh, we have deficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: with XYZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you use plant nutrient analysis,
you're able to actually catch these
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies or toxicities before they
become symptomatic, before they display on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to really allow you to
prevent any risk of decreased health rate
[SPEAKER_01]: for your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, we all know that
strains feed really differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have one strain that pulls up
fertilizer at a crazy rate compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running plant nutrient analysis,
you can say, hey, my plant has these
[SPEAKER_01]: certain elements at the exact ranges I
want them to be at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could save a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can cut back on a feed on this one
versus, hey, this guy's really hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to pump up cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to pump up, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, we have a lot of elements
that are considered mobile or immobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certain things like a phosphorus,
the plant can actually relocate within its
[SPEAKER_01]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a deficiency in a leaf,
it's going to pull phosphorus from another
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf and bring it over to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have elements like calcium that
are known as immobile, and these only move
[SPEAKER_01]: through the plant with transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you're following a VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you're right on there,
but maybe it's a little too humid,
[SPEAKER_01]: and your plants are kind of water-locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see they're a little bit
water-bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got curling leaves, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You run plant nutrient analysis,
and you realize, hey, my young tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have calcium, but I've been
feeding calcium like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lets you into kind of an
understanding of what's going on with your
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need to look at your HVAC a
little more carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here we have our
microbiolab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of isolated from the rest of
the lab, and here's where we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be working with samples that might have
microbial contaminants or even potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to start over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the area where we're running QPCR,
and this is for detection of those really
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous pathogenic organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are going to be things like
shigatopsin-producing enterobactyls like
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially what happens here is we'll
take a sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be put into an enrichment broth,
and then it will go into an incubator for
[SPEAKER_01]: a set amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this is doing is enriching any
presence of those potentially pathogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes to the point where we're
guaranteed to detect them with our
[SPEAKER_01]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these are one CFU program,
we really need to do that step to grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: out because we want to be extremely
confident that we're going to capture it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the sample has been adequately
enriched, we load it into a block,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it goes into this lovely automated
instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: This instrument is pretty much responsible
for setting up our PCR plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: PCR is a molecular-based detection screen
that's looking for target strands of DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: that are associated with what causes these
organisms to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, we're looking at genes that are
responsible for the toxin producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just like to compare this fresh mobile
phase A.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mobile phase is sort of like the blood
of this instrument here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It carries a sample through in a liquid
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows it to be separated out and
analyzed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it runs through the entire system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets red in this detector system down
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once it's been read, it's now
considered waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the waste bucket,
which is the solvent after it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then this is our GCFID, which we run
our terpene analysis on, as well as our
[SPEAKER_03]: residual solvent analysis.
So this is a kind of comprehensive GC
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have our headspace injector system
over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we run the residual solvents
test on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just aliquot, for example,
to a glass vial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heated up in the oven and then
analyzed through the column with a flame
[SPEAKER_02]: ionization detector, a high heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use a similar system, but it's
called a liquid injection system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually do solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's for our terpenes analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get an extract, put it into one of
these little vials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a syringe in here,
where samples takes one microliter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be vaporized as it turns into
the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's analyzed through the same
column system as residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, instead of a liquid mobile
phase, like in liquid chromatography,
[SPEAKER_02]: we use carrier gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have our gas system up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pull gas from the load downstairs in
these large tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's brought up at pressure here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use a gas matrix that the sample's
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last machine we have here is the
ICPMS, which is the machine that we run
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy metals on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Joe, do you feel comfortable talking
about that as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run heavy metals and plant nutrition
essentially here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for the leap analysis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of the way this works on nutshell
is we use nitric acid to digest the
[SPEAKER_02]: samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an inorganic chemistry test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're basically taking a sample,
breaking it down to its elemental atomic
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we break it down to its atoms,
digest it with acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we run it through plasma torch,
is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually uses argon gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it heats up and ionizes the atoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the atom has a charge and it's
been ionized, it's sent through the
[SPEAKER_02]: quadrupole detector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's sort of where non-charged ions
are considered for analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the charged ions are the ones that
we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this case, we're looking for charged
metallic ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say lead or iron or cadmium.
[SPEAKER_02]: The intellect of interest will be charged
and analyzed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way the magnet works is it's sent
straight through the detector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that spec is able to quantify based on
the mass-to-charge ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this gives us total counts of atoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty unique, very technically
advanced system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something in common in the
cannabis testing industry so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: So metals testing is required.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that machine specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few different instruments you
can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the AA, the atomic absorption
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bit simpler.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ICPMS is probably the standard of what
you want to be using.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can use a triple-quad system
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the 7700, 7800 Magilin are kind of the
standard ICPMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's definitely a step above the
atomic absorption method, which is sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: the base level for those tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So along with the heavy metals testing
that we carry out on the ICPMS,
[SPEAKER_01]: we also run plant nutrient analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really great tool for a grower
to diagnose problems with their plant
[SPEAKER_01]: before they become apparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of really highly skilled growers
know exactly what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're looking at their plant,
they can say, oh, we have deficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: with XYZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you use plant nutrient analysis,
you're able to actually catch these
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies or toxicities before they
become symptomatic, before they display on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to really allow you to
prevent any risk of decreased health rate
[SPEAKER_01]: for your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, we all know that
strains feed really differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have one strain that pulls up
fertilizer at a crazy rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to another one, if you're running
plant nutrient analysis, you can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, my plant has these certain elements
at the exact ranges I want them to be at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could save a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can cut back on a feed on this one
versus, hey, this guy's really hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to pump up cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to pump up, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, we have a lot of elements
that are considered mobile or immobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certain things like the phosphorus,

[SPEAKER_01]: tissues.

[SPEAKER_01]: plants are kind of water locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see they're a little bit water
bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got curling leaves, et cetera.

[SPEAKER_01]: environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need to look at your HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here we have our microbiome
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of isolated from the rest of

[SPEAKER_01]: And here's where we're going to be working
with samples that might have microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants or even potentially

we have the area where we're running QPCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is for detection of those really

[SPEAKER_01]: These are going to be things like shiga
toxin producing enterobacteria like really
[SPEAKER_01]: bad E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially what happens here is we'll
take a sample.

[SPEAKER_01]: PCR is a molecular based detection screen
that's looking for target strands of DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: that are associated with what causes these
organisms to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, we're looking at genes that are
responsible for the toxin producing
[SPEAKER_01]: elements of these bacteria as well as the
proteins that let them bind to the gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have a bacteria that produces
toxins but won't necessarily stick to your
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach, you'll be able to pass that and
you won't run into horrible medical
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli that sticks to your stomach but it
doesn't produce toxins, you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: totally healthy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why our QPCR screen is really
looking for those pathogenic genes in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular to make sure that you have the
safest product possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aside from our presence-absence
screens, we also do some quantitative
[SPEAKER_01]: assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things like your total aerobic
count, your total yeast and mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: or your interobacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that we use the BioVariu Tempo system,
which is a really user-friendly and
[SPEAKER_01]: high-throughput system that takes what is
known as most probable number testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: it puts it into these really small
cassettes that are super easy to handle
[SPEAKER_01]: and work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially what we see in this
cassette is really similar to like a
[SPEAKER_01]: growth plate where you would see you take
your sample, apply it to a grow media,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you're going to count what grows
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of take away the guesswork there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a tech that's manual,
you count through those organisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might be a little less accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have an automated system,
we really take a lot of human error out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is useful for counting things that
have action limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organisms like total yeast and mold or
total aerobic count bacteria have a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: action limit than the more dangerous ones
like the interobacter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because those things like
interobacter are associated with things
[SPEAKER_01]: like fecal-borne illnesses, viruses,
pathogenic organisms that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make you really sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like total aerobic or total yeast
and mold, these are slightly less
[SPEAKER_01]: innocuous, so they have a higher limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, you don't want to have
something that's outrageous because that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be harmful to the consumer and to the
individual who's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want people to be sitting in a
trim room handling extremely moldy
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis over time because that can lead
to chronic health issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's essentially our microbiote suite.
Thank you.
Thank you.
