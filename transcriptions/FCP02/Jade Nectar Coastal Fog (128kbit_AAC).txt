[SPEAKER_00]: Howdy!
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Friday!
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's October 14th, Friday, and just
wanted to demonstrate, by the way it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about 9 a.m., but just wanted to show sort
of the the perils of growing in coastal
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're usually fairly high above the marine
layer, but when we really get socked in
[SPEAKER_00]: with fog, this is the kind of experience
we get, and fog and high humidity at night
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis is not always a good match.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow, most of our genetics are
landrace, or just hybrids of just landrace
[SPEAKER_00]: to landrace and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, this is a lamb-zam,
we're calling it, but this is Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: lamb's bread crossed to zamal,
but the point being is even though we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get rain, I don't know,
I'm going to shake this plant here and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see if you can see all the water on
it from the fog all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you come this way, I'm going to show
you, this is our last Syrian plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think you can see here too all the
fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so when we start getting that
consistent marine layer coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it can, the buds will sit wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a testament to how mold
resistant these plants are because we
[SPEAKER_00]: still don't have any mold, but you know if
this goes on for weeks and weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, it can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why each environment is a little
bit different, and then you just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have to select genetics that fit your
environment and all the different elements
[SPEAKER_00]: and variables of your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, so far no mold, but I just wanted
to demonstrate because some folks don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know anything about fog and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Santa Cruz Mountains,
which is a beautiful thing, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get that marine layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just while we're here, I wanted to show
you another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually surprisingly,
just in the last few days I need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting a little yellow, so I'm going
to feed it just a little bit to kick it
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a Santa Cruz haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually original haze right here,
so it seems to be pretty darn happy about
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it probably won't be ready until
Thanksgiving or later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you guys have a wonderful Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
