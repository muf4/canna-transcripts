[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've got a blueberry chimera
that I need to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is blueberry muffin crossed with
chimera 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've seen me make all my compost in
IMO 4s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do is make a longer
video and just take you with me and show
[SPEAKER_00]: you how I'm going to make my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we're going to start off with some
of this fresh compost that I just moved
[SPEAKER_00]: all my compost, those two bins over here
to this bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bin, this bin is completely done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to need enough to fill up
just a small little pot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off with compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I grow in compost and I grow in IMO
3, which is basically an IMO 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some good material right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get IMO 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the acorn IMO 3 that I just made
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, about half and half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do, man, whenever we're mixing
this up, I'm just trying to make it look
[SPEAKER_00]: like something that I would want to grow
in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'd want to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be adding some moisture to it by
adding JLF.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like a good plate of soil right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be raining today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have to cover everything up,
I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is my compost and IMO 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I say it's basically an IMO 4 is
because I'm not cooking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not adding anything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this would be what an IMO 4 is made
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got plenty of nutrients in it
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got worms in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got fungi, bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the pot in there first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all fresh made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is made from my backyard,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is made from the woods right
here or my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics, I made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my soil looks like right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all free, all made from right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of my page is to teach you
how to do stuff for free so that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go buy stuff or you don't have to
go pay to learn things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see what old Blueberry
Commerry looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not very old at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need any mycelium or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use a little JLF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is a little moist right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need anything, but I will use my
nutrients would be JLF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, that is some free growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
