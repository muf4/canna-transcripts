[SPEAKER_00]: What's up friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants to make some brownies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: First things first, I just keep it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly what I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: A box of brownie mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Ghirardelli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghirardelli's the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got all sorts of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has got to be one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this recipe asks for is an egg,
a quarter cup of water, and a third cup of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what kind of oil we're going
to be adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing we got to do is preheat our
oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it gets nice and toasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: One 325.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to press start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a couple of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mix it all together, but I just highly
recommend that you add the egg first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, in case if you get any cracks
from the shell, you could go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: pick them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I save my eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to rinse them off and let
them dry out and save them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes for great calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whip up that egg really nice with the
whisk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I add a little water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add some cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we made this in the last video I
shared with you guys how to make cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and cannabis butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This recipe calls for vegetable oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used that coconut oil that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the regular virgin coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that up nice and well.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we pull out our bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of really great and
amazing recipes online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're up for a nice challenge,
then take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has caramel in it, which is super
yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could add pecans to this if you wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally would if I had pecans on me
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that I really like is just
chocolate with a bit of a peppermint
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tastes like peppermint chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any brownie recipes or
anything that you love adding to your
[SPEAKER_00]: brownies, go ahead and let us know in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear it because I love baking,
especially baking with canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and stirred up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how thick that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to get the chocolate off of
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like making my brownies in a square pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parchment paper is your best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps so that the brownies don't
stick to the bottom of the pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes baking easy and it makes cleanup
way easier too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to press my parchment paper
on the bottom of this pan here and fold in
[SPEAKER_00]: the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite spatula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just dunk the brownie mix
right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to get it on the parchment paper,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then scrape it off the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next step is to make sure that the brownie
is going into all of the corners of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using the spatula just to kind of
pull this brownie mixture to the corners
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one comes with the caramel pouch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what you do is you kind of
warm it up like this for about a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get your scissors and you cut out
the tiniest corner because you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be squeezing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a thick cut off of the
corner because then you end up getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: much caramel in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be nice and even with like
a smooth drizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I'm going to be doing on my
brownie pan is putting zigzags going up
[SPEAKER_00]: and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got a little bit left for the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency of your brownies is going to
depend on what cannabis product that you
[SPEAKER_00]: added into the oils when you made your
oils because this asks for a third cup of
[SPEAKER_00]: oil regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you want like a lighter
potency, you could just cut the brownies
[SPEAKER_00]: up into smaller parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how we have this right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, let me see if I can,
that would be a lot easier for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take the knife and I go across this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it made that design?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do the same thing going the
opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to drag it too deep,
just dragging my knife across the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon as the timer is ready, it's all ready
to go in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't take me no time to make these
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oven just went off 325 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this perfect pan is ready to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says 38 to 42 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like to go exactly in the middle
of what it's suggesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go with 40 minutes on this
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timer for 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to it soon as he's come out
of the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timer just went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing about brownies, I'm going to
turn the oven completely off so no more
[SPEAKER_00]: heat is being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to let the heat stay in
there because the thing about brownies is
[SPEAKER_00]: they take a long time to slowly cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most baked goods aren't like that,
like cookies or cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon as the timer goes off, you do the
little poke test with a fork or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that the batter is cooked all
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: With brownies and cheesecakes,
you just got to leave it in the oven for
[SPEAKER_00]: about a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to sit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's been a minute since I've
turned the oven off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what I'm going to do is just give
this door a small little crack like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way it gives the oven a chance to
completely cool off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brownies take a long time to,
they're still baking while they're cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to rush the cool off
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it take its time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably come back here in about
five to 10 minutes and pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to be cooling out
on the counter for probably about another
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 minutes until they're completely ready
to be cut up.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about five minutes, so now it's
time to take them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, these are looking really nice.
See?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to let these cool off
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe about five minutes total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you the fork test I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a fork and you dip it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes out clean, you know it's
baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to cool off on here for
about 10 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's easy to just take it out and to
cut it up into slices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how much you take is how
much of a dose you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't forget about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend starting with just a
much smaller bite at first and waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: half an hour and see how it affects you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people it could take up to one
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brownies are easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love making them.
