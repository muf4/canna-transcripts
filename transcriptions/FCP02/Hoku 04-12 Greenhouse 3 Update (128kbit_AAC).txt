[SPEAKER_00]: This is usually my seasonal storage
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got a bunch of pots and irrigation,
lights, a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this year I'm going to be just
running what I got 44 pots in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just do a little fino hunt,
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really sure quite yet, but I do have,
you know, like the party lights that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: control the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some soil in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing around with the recipe,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another little grow room back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of my outdoor breeding area,
which is going crazy with the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really got this thing up and
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did throw some tobacco seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just pull a couple of those out
and thin them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is got the pollen donor pot set up
and then the main beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this greenhouse is kind of
seasonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really use it a whole lot unless
I've got a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I've been busy filling pots and
whatnot, it's kind of just been sitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for me to plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some of my OZ selections back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunch of the CBG dominant F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, I've got a, actually found a CBG
dominant Death Eater Kush and a Wizard of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oz CBG dominant, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, starting off slow,
but I feel like this is what I had
[SPEAKER_00]: envisioned for the farm, you know,
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, you know, it just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, got everything set up here for
the drip lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically running, you know, four rows per
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got high mineral content in our,
in our well water, and then just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta get that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this is a little, our little
family farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys enjoyed the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's been going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been posting a lot,
but yeah, got some fresh cow manure that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe doing some, some worm compost with
trying to get that rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all screened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little fresh though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, hope everyone has a good day.
