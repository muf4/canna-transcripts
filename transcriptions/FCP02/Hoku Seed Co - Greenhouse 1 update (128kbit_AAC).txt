[SPEAKER_00]: Figured I'd do a little garden update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of crazy last month and or
so getting the harvest done and trimmed
[SPEAKER_00]: up, but we are reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: About to flip these in at the end of the
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we've got, I'm going through my
mango tree and back to Jaffee again,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a Seba by Karmatonic Sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pretty cool flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get like licorice, coffee, some cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got, I think it's the lemon
cookie dough here and the pineapple sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies back there from Thomas at Alpine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're running through Swiss
Cannabinoids CBDV, which this is his CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a couple runs in here, but and then
his CBDV back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I got to bring in some gravel
every time I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse fills up, but yeah,
everything's looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got the second topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bug yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, check out this volunteer tobacco
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is topped it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start flowering, but I mean,
look at this freaking leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monster leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if it doesn't justice,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other greenhouse is filled with some
OZ gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was harvest and then did some
columns of BioLive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, apart from the flies that love
that shit, everything is looking pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will definitely keep you guys,
except for this, I don't know if it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot or the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll see how they perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, everything else is looking
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope everyone's having a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
