[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, Chad Westport here and I am
back with another Nakatomi Plaza update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time we saw these plants,
they weren't looking that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just come back from vacation and
well, you know, the babysitter failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these back to health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might notice there's less of them
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off with 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because they got pretty stressed
while I was on vacation, they all showed
[SPEAKER_00]: me pre flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to determine which ones were
males and which ones were females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five females, five males, 50 percent
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it rolled with this batch of
the Nakatomi Plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've done a few things to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting them ready for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flip them into 1212 later
this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go in and take a closer look and
let me show you how I prepped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember the last video,
there were some pretty gnarly looking
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking lease on their definite
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a lockout which caused the
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plenty of the nutrient in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's why diagnosis and
understanding the cause of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: are important, because if I just saw it as
a deficiency and I added more,
[SPEAKER_00]: that wasn't going to correct my problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would actually create more of a problem
because there would be a giant imbalance
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil needs a balance of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got through that lockout by,
well, letting the soil dry out amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I potted them, which drastically helped
also because I'm using the so home living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had kind of a fresh nutrient draw it
can pull from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that you notice here is,
you know, I've cleaned up the legs on
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone in and removed some of the lower
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not actually done any training on
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing like a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can all see how it wants to
grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I would top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I would do some low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to create more apical colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a test run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for you all to see the Nakatomi
Plaza just growing naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm letting it do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I said I pulled off some leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cleaned up the legs before I flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to go in and remove
some of these extra leaves as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me actually scroll up and you guys
can take in the plants in their entirety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, there are two feet or
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get these flowered,
give you guys an example of what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect, kind of show you how the different
expressions are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we're looking at right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a little defoliation real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll then show you a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll wrap this up and we'll put them in
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've defoliated these pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before they go into flower, I really don't
think I'll have to do much after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the surviving five Nakatomi
plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other five were males.
[SPEAKER_00]: These five seem to be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to flip them into flower
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on day 10 of flower in the Nakatomi
Plaza test group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go in and take a closer look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little pan down, get you kind of a
full shot of what the Nakatomi plazas are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you saw the last video and how
much I actually defoliated before putting
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, if you look at them now,
they've definitely bounced back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, day 10, you definitely see some
bud formation on these plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting to bud up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited because I know what they're
going to finish like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they're not stretching very
much at all, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The front two, this one and that one,
they're staying pretty darn compact as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as the apical cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one in the back, little bit of
spacing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in the middle here, little bit of
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one in the back to a little
bit of spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are just minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the Nakatomi plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my test being group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, as you can see, day 10,
things are starting to bud up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 21 of the Nakatomi Plaza testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using that Sohum living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's water only soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've up potted those gnarly looking plants
into these three gallons, got the watering
[SPEAKER_00]: right, recovering from somebody else
taking care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's kind of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad they went through the stress
because it's a test run of the Nakatomi
[SPEAKER_00]: plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes stress is welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to bring the camera down to
this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how they are growing as far as
comparing the uniformity of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they are pretty darn close
to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, there's two sizes in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, you know, this front corner
here, this front corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one in the back, those are all the
same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got the one in the middle and
the one in the back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the same size as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those had just a little bit more stretch
in the epical cola area during the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things pretty much should have
stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very minimal stretching on these,
which is kind of indicative of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Westport grape juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to try to keep things short,
but we'll go in and have a closer look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the fan leaves, see how those
compare to each other and also how the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: formation is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the Nakatomi plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see again, the color along all
of these are pretty uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that center one in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the other one on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of, you know, the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, you know, not a lot of
stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still very compact here in that
epical cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: These don't have any training.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just growing all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can zoom out here and get this center
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's zoom in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the ones that had a little
bit more stretch there in that epical cola
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get it to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 28 of the Nakatomi plaza grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, let's go in and take a look at
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been growing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the Sohum living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been giving them water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did top dress this last week with
the Kiss Organic Nutrient Pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's what I typically have been
using for top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just gave it one top dressing and
it's been a few waters since.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that will work its way into the root
zone soon enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a last little kick to get it
through flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, day 28 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, you know, Bon Jovi about halfway
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go in and just take a look at the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nakatomi plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you all a quick scan of the canopy
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budding up nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we'll just call this the number
one Nakatomi plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the shorter size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's two sizes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a short one and then
there's one that's about, oh, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six inches taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the Apricola at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to get some nice trichomes
as well as the auxiliary branches behind
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over here to another one that's
about the same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I get that to focus for everybody
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of trichomes coming in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, kind of all over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice healthy green canopy spread out on
the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So decent amount of bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we'll call that number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go in here to the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the taller two that I have
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as you can see, it's really
like a four inch height difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a big deal, but little difference
anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled off a couple of the leaves on
this one already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, plenty, plenty of bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to grow plenty of nice buds
for me to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty stoked on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about seeing, we'll check out
the trichomes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 28, starting to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, then we go to this back one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is definitely putting on some
trichomes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually, just the way that the
pistols look, this one reminds me of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Westport grape juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more so than the father of
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran the daughters out of the father,
so I know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so this one, I guess we're
calling number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll come over to the number
five, which is one of the shorter ones as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one just has a little bit
different bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a different color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more leaves here, if you notice
there on the apical cola, but it's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: some nice, you know, auxiliary buds as
well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is day 28, so there's
going to be a lot more trichomes coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot more bud growth
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty stoked about these Nakatomi
plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you picked up a pack, thank you
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will enjoy them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 28, the Nakatomi plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boo yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twin Peaks cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody out there growing these,
the Nakatomi plazas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're enjoying them as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I am on this run, if you ever have any
questions about any of the gear that I
[SPEAKER_00]: make, definitely hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always happy to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to support my gear right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing it out.
