[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this would be a cool broad
point of view from all three of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy management.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the cuttings behind Corey,
which, you know, are obviously taken
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all they're all about the same
height.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the large canopy behind
Anthony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I imagine if that's a grow behind
Damon, I imagine he's paid some attention
[SPEAKER_02]: to canopy management as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like there's no real no,
I feel like there's no standard or like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's regular where art becomes
more than it becomes more of an art than a
[SPEAKER_02]: science from grow room to grow room
facility to facility, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, and I feel like it's a very under
discussed topic, but I feel like it's such
[SPEAKER_02]: an important one to maybe maximize yield
or maximize the happiness of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize airflow, just try to maximize all
the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like in the ABC book of
growing, there's just not many references.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want to get that narrative going
and see like people's point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corey, you want to go first?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go first if not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a little bit of a break here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's something that's I
would say there's like not a one size fits
[SPEAKER_01]: all for anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only way that it can be like sort
of standardized in the future is by,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, like teaching growers how
to discern like if you can do a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: style of training in your facility or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for example, if you don't have the
systems to handle like a massive amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower weight in your room, it might be
unwise to go like with a super thick sea
[SPEAKER_01]: of green like you see behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, there's plenty of
benefits to just going with a clone that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't mess with at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't prune it and it's just apicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a little bit easier in
those cases when you're not doing as much
[SPEAKER_01]: plant training to just maintain the
environment a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like just growers just need to
learn how to discern like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: can I do this even?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, like push your, you know,
push your crop to the limits of your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's, it's hard to
standardize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a right now a wave out West
for sure of a lot of guys touting a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits of not topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's really,
there's benefits to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, I've done a million
studies side by side and I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people are convinced of one way
or the other, but I think it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily a matter of which way is
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to be your grow space is
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be a best way for your
space, but it's just about discerning that
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and figuring that out for me and
for this space, we had great HVAC and our
[SPEAKER_01]: systems can handle a super thick canopy,
which is why we pushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do like a whole lot of like
topping and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially it's like a one top and
veg, let them run through the end of a
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during those first three weeks of
stretch, we are, you know, doing some LST
[SPEAKER_01]: under the trellis and bending and whatnot,
but it's very minimal on like plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely think that to speak to
your yield point, this is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: is huge for maximizing your crop,
but it's, it's again, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: like always go with this approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it can certainly be too much of
your systems can't handle it, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: my long winded answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad someone else has a long winded
answer on this thing other than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's like, yeah,
there's a lot of parameters for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel free to cut me off whenever
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm going to do that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, like, yeah, your space or also
the way I also kind of take a look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, what are your, goals,
particularly, you know, are you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow, you know, are you hanging
out and just doing stuff in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: tents?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a totally different strategies,
you know, before I was just, I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: topping pretty much anything in my tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just, you know, filling pots side by
side and just trying to get as much kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant material there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same thing when I was,
you know, testing out auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you just kind of put them in,
drop them and just kind of see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what different types of cannabis
plants do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're in the commercial
space, a few parameters for you in your
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial space is definitely your
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that all of your
trellis squares have something in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want any empty space
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that maximized for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty spaces is a wasted opportunity
financially for the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that those are
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then also have like, other parameters
in your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also will apply at home,
but it's like, what system do you have at
[SPEAKER_00]: home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing in Rockwell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing a living soil system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the response rate of your plants
and your ability to feed them is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be pretty aggressive in the
hydroponic setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're going over in living
soil, you probably want to chill out a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, understand your liquid feed
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what also you're doing in a
robust living soil system and try and
[SPEAKER_00]: manage that when you're pinching your
plant, you have to, you know, also think
[SPEAKER_00]: about that, you know, are you going to
need an increased calcium so that you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, helping your shoot tips actually
grow while you're, you know, doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're just pinching your plant lacking
in calcium and then not getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: response that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also having that nutritional
understanding of what you're doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like if you're in the greenhouse,
you have different seasons, so you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different light level that is going to
affect the growth rate of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're indoors, you're maximizing
PPFD all the time, you can just fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: slam it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the greenhouse,
you know, even if you do have supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, it's still not going to be the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, when I was working in the
greenhouse, we had distinct times when we
[SPEAKER_00]: would reduce the amount of shoots on our
plants and, you know, increase the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of shoots on every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter time, we would try and have
more shoots that are out there because we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't getting as much development if we
had less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the summertime, I mean,
the plants were just fucking rocking and
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would reduce the number of shoots
because the plant was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just developing all this biomass where we
didn't need to have as many shoots that
[SPEAKER_00]: were in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants themselves were doing really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for me currently right now,
what I'm trying to understand is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how many shoots am I going for
because I do have some math in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a quick calculation is I pinched to six
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll go and count six,
pinch that on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a week to 10 days after that,
I'm going to pinch those six and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a week after that, I'm going to
go and pinch those 12 and I'll have 24 at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way then I can calculate stem
density on my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try and deliver the right amount
of nutrition equally to all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one of the worst things that
you can do for canopy management is make
[SPEAKER_00]: that uneven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a different amount of stems
per different plant, that is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a different nutrition requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that if you have
those targets, you have those goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's one consistent target that
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you are going to do, you know,
two different strategies in a room,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that one strategy in a place where
you're going to remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to lose track of it,
but make sure that they're all together
[SPEAKER_00]: because that canopy size is going to be
different than the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I'm doing a six shoot
strategy and a four shoot strategy right
[SPEAKER_00]: now because I don't know what the fuck is
this new cultivar that I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put my ones that I pinched,
you know, they reached a six inch stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pinching that at four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let those fly in a bay and
then everything else I pinched to six and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll kind of figure it out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those are grouped together so that
I can make sure that that canopy is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one of the other ways people do a
canopy management is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mac one, for example, that cut that I
was growing, we would go by heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really give a fuck about stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go by heights, strict heights,
11 inches, 22 inches, and then another one
[SPEAKER_00]: at 34.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, that is what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely more than one way to
fry a fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just understand what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, you know, again, at the
commercial space, one last kind of piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of advice is I would be really careful
about, you know, stretching out your stems
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing any LST training things in there
because at the end of it, you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest those fucking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like pulling your plant out
and it's a little bit crooked and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting caught in the trellis because your
worker isn't really doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention to the plant,
that could potentially cause you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you kind of,
you know, be a little bit strict about it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are at that commercial space,
because it might be nice that you do end
[SPEAKER_00]: up getting that bud, but you might lose it
when people are handling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I've seen that a few too
many times across this country in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a Canadian thing, but yeah,
we've kind of avoided trying to do some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things in there because when you
just pull it through the trellis net,
[SPEAKER_00]: people get, you know, in a mindset and
they're just trying to get those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think, I think that should end
my rant at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered enough in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's such a complex subject
and yet it never gets discussed enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the real art to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depends on your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, you know, if you've got some of
those columnly, column layer ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing like this instead of like
that, you're going to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's just, it's a wide open
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take so many different ways at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get that same height, it's
hilarious the different things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about like negative differential?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody do negative differential to
control the height of their plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the temperature warmer at nighttime
than the daytime by two degrees and to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the stretch of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also a real brilliant way to do
canopy management.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a real stretchy ass plant,
I've been able to keep, there's one in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, it was like a super thin leaf
and she would do about a three to four X
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking like we'd get to about nine
foot plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd go in there and de-leaf those
fucking things and try to keep them down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they just kept on moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, negative differential was also
another thing that I would use as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: environment management was concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that was mentioned by my
esteemed colleague above me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here was a brilliant fucking thing for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing you can do to keep
your plants, you know, a little bit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do one follow-up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like one major nuance to me,
you guys didn't cover, you guys covered so
[SPEAKER_02]: much canopy depth and doors and maybe even
versus outdoors, even though I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: well known that the sun penetrates all the
way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the carpet of canopy is always
an interesting nuance to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some grows, maybe it should only be
eight inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some grows, maybe it should be three feet
and like sky's the limit kind of quite
[SPEAKER_02]: literally for sun grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what you guys think of like
canopy depth, like how thick is the
[SPEAKER_02]: blanket of flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're talking vertical flowering
canopy.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, again, uh, I feel like you can
almost safely answer any question by
[SPEAKER_01]: saying it's nuanced, but like,
it just depends on your environment to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it depends on your setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, if, if everything's cool,
I'm shooting for a three or four foot
[SPEAKER_01]: fricking canopy and like a six or seven
foot plant and then calling it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tall plant, but that's a lot of
flowering canopy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just my preference and like my
target, even like in my own grow space is
[SPEAKER_01]: like roughly three feet of flowering
canopy, but it takes a solid life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light with, you know, quality parts to be
able to throw the light deep in there or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that paired with your
defoliation strategy also plays a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what would you say, Corey?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, God, it's like as big as we
can get them in commercial space,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like really just like how
effective those buds actually are down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, there's, there's that,
that greenhouse picture that showed
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier there, like that was, it's a
really good thing where you can see like
[SPEAKER_00]: how much we actually leave on that plant,
which is like almost all of the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, versus like indoor where, yeah,
you're trying to like figure that part
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what I have kind of come to
the conclusion of those, if you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, number one, if you're taking
those big leaves off, you're definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: really upsetting your photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess just all over the fucking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause those leaves are solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking that goodness from the sun
and creating your goodness for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to like keep some
of those, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to manage what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really surprised the amount of
leaves on the plant that they were leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it was growing consistent,
but definitely it was not the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is, you know, definitely more
generic and that sort of says value weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the plant was consistent in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see a lot of interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were growing seven,
eight strains of room and all of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: like pretty consistent, you know,
obviously like there's some pretty basic
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological changes that'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, we were able to
have a good, you know, gap three feet
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum, um, canopy that was going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I briefly talked to you Benzing at
university of Guelph on the fucking plant
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me fucking powdery mildew and fucking
thrips in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that guy who gave me that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ended up being really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, go ahead about Guelph.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's to the spider mates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like I use the other hand,
but that's like a salute to Ai Weiwei.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most brilliant dissident
artists of like all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a, I was randomly Roman around
in Portugal and his, um, I've been trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to see his art installation for like a
decade now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just walking down the road and I
saw that and I said, you've got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking joking me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just walked right in and saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, shout out Ai Weiwei.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is a yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pulling up some, uh, I almost feel
like I'm, I need to get like hot wings and
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot sauce here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This for like the in depth shit that
you're coming in and pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, that's like golden oldie
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like almost four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chloe's for Kobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go off question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, it kind of, it falls in line
with the canopy depth question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, I shoot for a generic three
feet because I feel like I could achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but you know, to really dial it in,
you've been brought up a great point and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is his recommendation alone,
but I'm sure there's like a range like
[SPEAKER_01]: this that each grower can find in their
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but he was basically saying,
you know, if you peek out at 1200 PPFD,
[SPEAKER_01]: try it to go no lower than 300 PPFD to
like ensure a better product quality or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So defoliate up to a certain PPFD level,
maybe not 300, but like, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that would be an interesting thing
to dial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like find the efficiency of like,
where, where's the flower like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, starting to, to get hard or,
you know, obviously some strands it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: brick and rock hard the whole way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some strands, it certainly plays a
huge role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and things can get real larky down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have those PPFD targets or
just like a height target, I think is a
[SPEAKER_01]: more basic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been sway is definitely more dialed
in, but I think that it's got a very per
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar probably, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also like, again, like having
that, like same amount of shoots that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going for is really key to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then you'll find consistency all the
way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the shoot math for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you pinch one of your shoots,
one too many or two too many, or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you just have an imbalance shoot in
there, that whole thing is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen that that was, you know,
it's a really great way to troubleshoot
[SPEAKER_00]: your workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go around your plan and if you
see like one branch just f*****g monster
[SPEAKER_00]: vegging out from the other ones,
well, you notice that one definitely got
[SPEAKER_00]: missed the pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, five or six or flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got this one just f*****g giving her
for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's, it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those, that nutrient
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, you know, feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I really encourage people to try that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you do have access to a few
different plants, like, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say just an amount of plants,
you know, like do some of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pinch plants at different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like see what it does, like understand
what that plants do and it, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll advance you so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was, again, like one of the
really good things about working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: place with that many units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to do so many f*****g
experiments in the last three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: like even just outside of the zemir punja
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And f**k, like I learned so much stuff
about the morphology and the physiology of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plan and reactions, you know,
and it's just, yeah, it's, it's advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: so quickly in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oxins, phytohormones, Tony knows all about
phytohormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I like hanging around you,
smart young guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do any sort of canopy management
and I, I have, but the reason why I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: is cause I don't feel like I'm getting a
true expression of, that particular plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm manipulating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you do the low stress training
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to just, you're saying seed
plants or even clone plants as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't worked with clones for quite
some time, but even with clones,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found it busy work, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather just let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cumber, like for Cumber, you have to,
you have to, because it all comes down to
[SPEAKER_03]: square footage, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, so, and, and efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he, I agree with what you guys are
saying, but for me, I just, I want to see
[SPEAKER_03]: the true expression and I don't want to
get into your expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do a hard top, like if you do
low stress training and just, you still
[SPEAKER_00]: have your branches and you haven't done
like a destructive topping as I would call
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do with the commercial space that you
would still, you're not really like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not inducing any like pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're down into the roots to force a
reaction to get some nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're not, I think you're still
getting the true expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not buying a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not dry trimming my plants and I am
not training a canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get off my lawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that perspective, Damon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew there would be like three very
interesting points of views.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and even a clone plant, if you do
get a clone, you'll just let it run.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like on the complete other side,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a clone of Mike fucking top it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take a cut right off the top of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get moving, I'm like first top is
best cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me, I had a, I had a homie who sent
me a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't really used to think like
this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like at least six or four,
but like I had a homie who works in a
[SPEAKER_00]: micro space, like micro cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got like 2,500 square feet,
3000 somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he like, as soon as he transplants his
clones, he tops that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just removes a pickle right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really like before the root,
like when he's like rooting his plugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's topping them or as soon as he's
transplanting them after after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was like, I don't think I've ever
goofballed experimented out that with that
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get him to like send the video
cause I was like, okay, you're not even
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it in a fucking commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you had to have hit targets
or else your ass would have been fired by
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, there has to be something going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got in, you know, I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some R and D stuff like a couple of
weeks ago and I fucking said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is a cookies variety,
so it is going to stretch like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certain of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, well, this, if I'm going to
top one that early, this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put on my big boy pants and decided
to completely go, left field and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have man that is people who
brought me up in the game would hear me
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize guys, but I'm just doing it in
the name of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems.
Okay.
