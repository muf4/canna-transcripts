[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, this is Peace of Mind Farming doing
a video of the garden of the herb garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start off with Moon
Mountain Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in a 45 gallon pot with all these
are in living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Moon Mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of LSD training, scrogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Purple Pez.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in a 35 gallon and these all get LSD
training and a regiment of top dressings,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually worm castings, bakashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately we did recently a, this is a Holy
Rosa type 2 by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in a 45 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little companion plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recently did a soil drench with pumpkin
one day and then the next day we did
[SPEAKER_00]: micronized gypsum with a whole bunch of
different bio ag stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hundred gallon and these are our
autofill.
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest are photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is Pure Royal Lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with this one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is a Dutch Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be harvested probably next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is the Durban Runts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is in a 35 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this here is the Afghani
currently hosted by a 45 gallon and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking nice and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is very, very thick and she is very,
very thick underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is Love Laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't realize she was a photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put her in a earth box bought from
Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great product by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized she was a photo period
about December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's been in here for quite some time
and it's about, I think seven gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and it's got a hydroponic system down
below in the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is doing fantastic in it and doing
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is another Moon Mountain Kush in
a 35 gallon and put in the soil same time
[SPEAKER_00]: as the other Moon Mountain in the 45
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's just taken her sweet time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this over here was one of our mothers
that is currently being retired to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of her clones was now becoming the
new mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is French Macaroon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, this plant smells like
chocolate pastries when it's in flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some hot weather coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, we're currently trying to keep
them on a tight water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, underneath that straw is our
inline drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these plants are hooked up to a
timer drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
