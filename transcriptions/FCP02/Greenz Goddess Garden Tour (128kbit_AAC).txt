[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Julie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may know me as Green Scottis
on Instagram or up in chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a Colorado cultivator caregiver,
which means that I grow cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also one of the founding trustee
members of Luna Gardens Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we like to do is help educate the
community about cannabis medicine and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps people heal from various ailments
and diseases, and which types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes they should be
going after when choosing medication,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on their ailment and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to help share research and
information to help people understand
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine and plant medicine in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my way of advocating for the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we do as a
cultivator caregiver is we make medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: oils for our patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one in particular is a THC strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go after terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple different one-to-one
strains of oils that have an equal amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just got some seeds, so we're
looking at getting into growing more
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-rich strains, CBG-rich strains,
and looking for ones with a really high
[SPEAKER_00]: loud terpene profile, because terpenes,
cannabinoids, they're actually found in
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of plants and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I love about growing
organically is mainly the microbials that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pulling up out of the soil into the
plant and consuming it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to eat healthy foods
grown organically with microbial and I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe a lot of reasons why most people
get really bad ailments and diseases is
[SPEAKER_00]: because their diets are not high-enriched
microbial-grown food or even medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what got me to change my mind about
growing cannabis organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first learned how to grow,
it was with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I started getting to the
medicinal sides of things, I realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: My weed was tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tasting amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My products are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I continued on with that and I feel
like it's really important to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and food organically because it's
all medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter which plant you're
getting your medicine from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I wanted to share a video with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly learned so much this past year
about growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: First person who brought living soil to my
attention was Brian years ago at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a talk about living soil and I was
really into it and a lot of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was growing with weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time I was the only one but
throughout the years and through FCP and
[SPEAKER_00]: through meeting all the friends that I
did, I found out there's so many people
[SPEAKER_00]: out there just like me who love growing
cannabis and food organically and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned so many different ways of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are using microbial teas to
inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are doing top dressing to
inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the Korean natural farming
side of things that I learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: a JDOM way of doing things and I've taken
a few courses over this past year just
[SPEAKER_00]: learning how to grow cannabis in general
and I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply it all in the garden which might
be a little bit too much but I swear one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these days I'm going to find that right
basic easy formula that just works out
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to share my outdoors garden
because if it wasn't for Future Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Project and everyone who's came on the
show, I wouldn't have been able to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things I was able to learn how to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a quick shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much Peter, Leighton and
especially Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for all your guests,
everyone you've had on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing all the education
for free to teach people how to grow their
[SPEAKER_00]: own medicine whether it's cannabis or hemp
or even tomatoes and cucumbers or peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have a receptor system and each
different plant, terpene, cannabinoid can
[SPEAKER_00]: attach to different receptors in our
systems and help us heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First I'll introduce you to the ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These first four plants that you see right
here, here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behind her is another over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big one over there and this one right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: FCP had a guy Masonic Seeds on and he was
given out free seeds which I was so
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful to get, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are Los Angeles Peer Cush,
cross with Panama Red, cross with Wilson
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what these four lovely ladies
are right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had Mr. Toad on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really tall plant back here is
Hayesfordays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really skinny because when I first
moved the plant back here these ones have
[SPEAKER_00]: already been growing back here for a
couple of months and I figured it would
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up and it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were started in January,
the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayesfordays, that was started in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that seed in the ground in the
beginning of June and it's just as tall as
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just needs some more sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet if it got plenty of sunlight it
would have grown a lot bigger than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to give you an idea, let's come
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about five feet tall, three inches and
these plants are clearly taller than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't even touch the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how tall these plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my third year growing outdoors so
plants in here are doing absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and I've learned so much more this
past year about growing organically than I
[SPEAKER_00]: have before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course this season is going to be my
best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys remember how having, son of a
bitch, sorry, I just saw a grasshopper
[SPEAKER_00]: jumping on my plant and I had to take it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, these two back here, you guys
know Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy that creates We Should Taste
Good gear t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also does fermented plant extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using his pumpkin ferment if
you've seen any of my videos on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also does seeds too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is wolf glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's crossed with gorilla glue but
I'm not going to say that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be my season's one-to-one
strain, equal amounts of CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I had learned last season was
about chopping my CBD plants down a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit early because I do want to keep that
volume equal so that way there's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: much THC dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to harvest this a little bit
early than I would like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just learned that from doing it last
year so this year I want to make sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's this one, wolf glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also back here is a wolf glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty freaking huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them up in nets and it's not good
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to net them up some
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, way, way, way tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here I have my favorite,
Bubblicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are for oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got these from Nirvana Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they're out in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has always been my one-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've gone with these guys and I
kept getting their seeds for so many years
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've never had issues other than,
you know, just making sure to harvest it
[SPEAKER_00]: early so you can have a good product that
has very equal amounts of CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait too long to harvest then the
THC amount might go up a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: but not by much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I'm trying to go for that
one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got shaded out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started this little grow bed,
I walk in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down here on that's the soil and I,
as you can tell, I got steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was plenty of room when I first
started it with just six plants and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, well, there's so much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could put some more plants back
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put in the two Bubblicious and then I
put in the one Hayes for Days and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not enough room for these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this Bubblicious hardly sees any
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Hayes for Days hardly sees any sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens with the rain when it
comes down is it goes into the gutter back
[SPEAKER_00]: here and drops down into a trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I collect all the rainwater and a lot
of times I'll water with that rainwater
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like the Jadam liquid fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make a cannabis Jadam liquid
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in March we had some pretty heavy
snow and I put a bunch of old cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that I had to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turned out to be males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chopped them all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in a big bucket, actually a big
brook barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filled it with some of the snow water and
just let it sit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For six months and sometimes I'll put a
little bit of that juice into my big
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also right now, since they are still in
the veg phase, when I'm down here watering
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground, I'll also spray the leaves
to get the food on the leaves as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to come out here early, early in the
morning before it gets too hot because in
[SPEAKER_00]: here it does get really, really,
really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably why these plants are
so huge right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a whole lineup of things that
I like to foliar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is K&F maintenance spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my favorite things to foliar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to do some sort of like plant
ferment with things like aloe or silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to foliar with EM 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it from Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of my stuff from Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar spray with sulfur as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow I'm about to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar spray with some sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them got, you know, like little
bug bites on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love, I love being out here and I
love growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I absolutely love making is
just homegrown medicine for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love making it organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the sun, the natural sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love coming out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my chill zone where I want to
smoke some weed or relax or just listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite places to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let you guys go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've got things you want to do
today too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to let you get back at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions about how to
make anything, feel free to reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the KNF formulations and some of
the JDOM I have made myself and I share
[SPEAKER_00]: that on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys want to check it out,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned it all for free basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one thing I really like being able
to do is being a thrifty farmer and saving
[SPEAKER_00]: some money so that way I could grow
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, hit me up,
reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email is greensgoddess420 at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not always on there, but if you leave
a message, I'll get back to you when I
[SPEAKER_00]: have time because I'm usually in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I also wanted to give one
quick shout out to my husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony, because if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be able to do all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm able to do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in and say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi, Ange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear she's taller than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just doing some editing on the video
and a whole bunch of stuff got cut out,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the most important part of the
whole video.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little view of what we got going
on down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some redwood bark mulch,
which worked out really nicely to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my second year going in this bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically do a coots mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coots mix is one third peat, one third
aeration, like pumice or rice hulls,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one third compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of that could be worm castings,
and the other half could be regular
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your basic coots mix, and then you
have some amendments added into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like gypsum, glacial rock dust,
and azomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basalt, crab meal, oyster shell,
neem meal, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google coots mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have in my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made that a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't use this bed last year,
and in fact, last year there were so many
[SPEAKER_00]: fires, there was ashes all over,
and I bet a lot of those ashes fell into
[SPEAKER_00]: this bed from a lot of the fires that
happened last summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year what I did was, I grabbed a
little bit more peat and a lot of compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I tilled that into what I already had
in the ground, and I let that sit for
[SPEAKER_00]: about a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I came in and I made another big ass
batch of coots mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did like 100 gallons,
and I put that in here, along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to top dress at least once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this little mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a recipe from Gold Dust Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got your basic top dressing
amendments, products from down to earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, like oyster shell,
kelp, alfalfa, gypsum, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't name it all off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put it all in a mix, and that's what
I put, probably about a cup of that per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do bokashi once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love bokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you have leaves you've got to
defan or pull down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it fall to the ground and
naturally do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanted to share that with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't let you go without the most
important part, what's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is straight in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's nothing really.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in pots or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hope you guys have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spark one up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
