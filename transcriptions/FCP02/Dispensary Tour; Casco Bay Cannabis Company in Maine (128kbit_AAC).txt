How's
[SPEAKER_00]: it going Tom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a holiday in Maine,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vacation land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, would you like to introduce yourself
in the shower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Tom Falby.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Casco Bay Cannabis Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the owner of the company and this
owner of this fine building here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just opened the beginning of April.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we carry MOFGA certified clean
cannabis that is grown by Casco Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to carry some additional
people who will also be cultivating with
[SPEAKER_01]: that standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of Elaine Ingham's
composting style and all that the living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil growing method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we grow and then we've got
some edibles and now some live resin and
[SPEAKER_01]: some live resin carts and some cartridges
and we're just tucked away here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of a small neighborhood in South
Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know about four to six thousand people
around here and we're just looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: serve serve the medical community as best
we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved with the medical
program since 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got started when I had Lyme disease and
I was I was using medical marijuana for
[SPEAKER_01]: that and and then just wanted to help
other people as best I could because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was it was an amazing experience for me
and and I've seen it make an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: difference for so many people and in
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know people walking with a cane to
walking without a cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: People with MS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just love I just love growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you can't beat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't you can't beat it and the
microbial scientific stuff that's always
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed on on future canvas project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I tune in every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on every Thursday to listen to
Leighton and everyone else talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how was the process of getting open
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was a long it was a long road
2020 was when I started May of 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was I was looking around being
like, yeah, should I do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know because this was a commercial
kitchen at the time and it would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to just leave it as a commercial
kitchen and rent it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, New England is in my
opinion, I grew up in New Hampshire and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, New England is famous for being
progressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once the floodgates of
progressivism open, they put the brakes on
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of was what I expected to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, man, if I'm going to do it,
I better apply now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I filled out, you know, the initial
application with the town planner and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to work with the town planner and
fill out, you know, several hundred pages
[SPEAKER_01]: of of site plans and all that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go before the town and they
decide whether or not they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: give you the thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they give you the thumbs up,
which happened to for me in December 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you've got six months to start and
you've got a complete 25 percent of any
[SPEAKER_01]: changes within six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what counted as 25 percent for me
was paving and it was the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I couldn't get paving done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it went down to the wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the paving done in April 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we're in the middle of
Covid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, my carpenter's coming
in to do work in here and he couldn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies and getting windows like a
skylight and that kind of thing put in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, took until August and then
getting security put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Security is all backed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting all their stuff from China
and then everybody and their mom is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting an adult use grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have huge projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was kind of back seated for a
while and that got put in in December and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that delayed for two months because I
had the wrong recorder and I had to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that from China and that took two months
to get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we're in February 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go before the town again,
because I initially applied as I initially
[SPEAKER_01]: applied as one company and I thought I
could just easily change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, no, you have to get
a new license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to get a new license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go before the town that happened in March.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I opened this month in April just
in time for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a grueling process,
but I'm glad you made it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine it might be even less
grueling than some states, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it didn't sound easy, but yeah,
glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think in Maine, at least the
small guy has a shot, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that that's why you see such a
thriving community of kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of caregivers in the state
and you see such active legislative
[SPEAKER_01]: participation from caregivers because they
have a shot and they have a voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas I think in other states,
at least my impression is that there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: even a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slight chance of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: A slight chance of rolling the dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What products have the most movement or if
there's anything that you're just stoked
[SPEAKER_00]: to share, you want to show us a couple of
the flowers that you think are the best or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever products in general are moving,
whether it be vapes or rosin or edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shiatsu Kush has been moving and
that's a good one for pain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the, what else has been moving?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grape Gushers has been moving pretty
well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape Gushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Grape Gushers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys see the most traction here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mostly flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mostly flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some edibles are starting to move as
people, you know, it was funny because I,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I'm waiting on the town to get a
sign put up on the side of the building
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I put out a green cross flag and
people didn't really come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got a sandwich with like a sandwich
board with, you know, Casco Bay Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Company written on it and people have
started coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, you know, it's getting a little
bit of traction, but there's some people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the neighborhood are starting to come
in looking for, you know, to get edibles
[SPEAKER_01]: and those caramels are starting to go
pretty well because they're based with
[SPEAKER_01]: FECO and so those are cruising along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some shiatsu for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is most of this in-house or do you have
some trusted caregivers that you also work
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've got some, we've got,
we're adding more caregivers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now this is mostly in-house,
but adding more caregivers as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the goal is just to have,
you know, local caregivers that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: featured in here and kind of spread the
love of like a small operation and the
[SPEAKER_01]: small grower, you know, just the craft
grower is, you know, more tuned into
[SPEAKER_01]: quality than quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we have, you know, we've got
medical cards that you can get on demand
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone can come in that doesn't have a
medical card and they can call this number
[SPEAKER_01]: right here and say urgent, they can text
urgent Casco Bay Cannabis Company with a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of their ID and a selfie and they
can get a medical card within 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a question for Mr. Guerrero.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your favorite daytime snack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily an edible, but whether it
be a chip or a cookie or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, what's your go-to daytime snack?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite daytime snack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I say blue corn chips and hummus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue corn chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm a big connoisseur of,
you know, and buy like all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of health food stores and that
Tito's whatever that place in Mexico is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even pronounce it, but it's
Chitolan or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, those are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of that question is do you
foresee in 2023 an absolute explosion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry tied into the snack
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, Doritos and Nestle are
going to start getting involved with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry or even the smaller,
you know, let's say craft, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: snackers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like some, some, I mean,
there's, there's like, I've got ice cream
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the, you know, the view,
look around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, the more you look around,
there's more, more and more products
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figuring out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, I think Doritos or,
you know, I mean, you see chocolate bars
[SPEAKER_01]: and all those kinds of things,
but snackies would be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and hummus, I would love to have
it in hummus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I ask is I think, uh,
Mr. Guerrero, he's forecasting that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the next explosion of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to share that info.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, um, you had touched briefly on it
in the beginning, but do you have anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else that you want to tell the people and
the future cannabis project about yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: or how they can find you or follow you or.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at Casco Bay cannabis company on
Instagram, we're located at 575 Westbrook
[SPEAKER_01]: street in South Portland, right in the
middle of red bank and old English
[SPEAKER_01]: village, right across from the new
development there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, come on by, we'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, serve you if you're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is live from Maine signing out back
to you, future cannabis projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you.
