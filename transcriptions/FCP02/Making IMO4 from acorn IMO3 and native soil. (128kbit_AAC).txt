[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, today I'm going to be making IMO
4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Acorn IMO 3 that just came out of
Gasoline Alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a chunk of it, let's look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Acorn IMO 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the IMO all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Acorn IMO 3 was made with logs that
look like this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushrooms growing out of them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground up tons of logs like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added Acorn meal that I gathered around my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got them all crushed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added some inputs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooked that in Gasoline Alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll be taking this IMO 3 and I'm
going to be using some native soil I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you where I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be adding some inputs and I'll
show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, and this is IMO 4 material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting some native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out from underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all those mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be native soil I'll be using to
advance my IMO 3 to IMO 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just went and got a bunch of chicken
manure today for IMO 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're getting right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so first I'm going to mix this
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically equal parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still under a 5 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equal parts of native soil that I got from
Outback that you saw in those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about the same amount of Acorn
IMO 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also be adding the inputs and I'll
show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of mix it up to something I
think it looks like I could grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need to add a little more soil,
remember it's going to get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that right there was wet,
would it be a good growing medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's getting real close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to add a little more soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so there's the first batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like something that I could
grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much a good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to make a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little tote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acorn IMO 3 native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want enough to fill this tote right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the contrast in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what comes with native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never worry about creatures or things I
see out in the native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let them come along and keep doing
what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here's the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a little JLF in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour it all in and then if I need more
moisture, I'm just going to add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hash water lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the purple hue to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis we used or the cannabis we
washed was very purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is alfalfa and kelp FPE made by
Atgonja Pharma Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some seawater.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is oriental herbal nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fish amino acid from Marco's
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that going to get mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the full wheelbarrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to get poured all over it
and then if I need more moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: I add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has a little bit of moisture in
it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That native soil does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get this all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water kind of drains to the bottom a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little more water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might even add some rice holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break this up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The native soil is a little more compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: More compact than compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often use compost for this method for my
own growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see how the dirt will kind of
clump.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of rice hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of wheat bran.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help break that soil up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of wheat bran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have to add more moisture
with all these dry ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will just make it a better growing
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a firm experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have to be moist because it has to
get inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dry, it just doesn't work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, not wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so the IMO 4 has been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are two different types of IMO
4.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both made from Acorn IMO 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was made from native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was made from compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the bucket that I took to
the mushroom farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a few batches of IMO 4
because you need IMO 4 to advance the IMO
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need a couple of IMO 4s and you
need a couple of IMO 5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I've made all that Acorn IMO
3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make a lot of IMO 4s so that I
can make a couple more IMO 5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'm going to close this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in gasoline alley and show you the
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, here's the cooking conditions
inside gasoline alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: One space heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some gunny sacks that I'll put on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of poke some holes in it
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those holes will start to see high
feet grow all in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take about four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to stay covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space heater kind of close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: About five days I have some good IMO 4.
Alright.
Thanks for watching.
