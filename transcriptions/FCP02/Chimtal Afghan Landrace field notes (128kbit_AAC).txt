[SPEAKER_00]: hey there okay field notes afghan landrace
this variety is called chim tall chim tall
[SPEAKER_00]: and very impressed with this one this is
definitely a keeper so we grew a few
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos of this we've already harvested a
few but this one is probably the favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whole mix and maybe we'll just take
a little cruise around so you can see this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant and all of its
[SPEAKER_00]: splendor yeah very traditional afghan and
then we're finally getting some colder
[SPEAKER_00]: nights so we're starting to get a little
bit of that you can see like on this leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that black purple action going
that's common with afghans but still we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had a lot of cold nights so if it
got colder at night this whole plant would
[SPEAKER_00]: start turning black which is really
striking and beautiful but right now this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and by the way this one's i think
we're going to harvest it today field
[SPEAKER_00]: notes the smell on this is like um it's
like mango chutney like a spiced mango
[SPEAKER_00]: really beautiful stunning delicious but
deep it's got like a deep earthy ancient
[SPEAKER_00]: thing going along with the fruit so anyway
uh chim tall absolutely love it oh by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way while we're in the neighborhood if you
guys just want to see a big honking plant
[SPEAKER_00]: here's like a south african variety and by
the way this thing it's even route root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound we haven't been had a chance to fill
in all the dirt so next year we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow these again and they'll probably
be twice as big so anyway if you guys if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to grow county fair size
ridiculous ridiculously large plants uh
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these south african varieties are
just insanely vigorous but we'll get to
[SPEAKER_00]: those later anyway we're focusing on you
right now chim tall killer plant all right
