[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be a interesting conversation
tonight we're gonna talk about the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere and we'll probably get a
little bit into the rhizosphere and we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: probably talk a little bit about the regen
conference this weekend because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: where I am heading in the morning so
definitely be talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things going on this weekend depending on
how the show goes hello Nick good evening
[SPEAKER_02]: next week we're gonna do because you're
not gonna be here Nick I do have a
[SPEAKER_02]: different guest coming next week a
gentleman by the name of Jesse and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna come and we're gonna talk about HVAC
and humidifying and dehumidifying and why
[SPEAKER_02]: do humidify tires may not necessarily be
the right choice especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: running AC because they can be somewhat
the same thing interesting if I could join
[SPEAKER_05]: that one actually I like the conversation
around environmental controls because it
[SPEAKER_05]: seems like in most cases the physical
constraint that large-scale operations run
[SPEAKER_05]: into is their total dehumidification
capacity so yeah yeah absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely too many things going on this
week and again getting ready for the regen
[SPEAKER_02]: conference so I spent I spent an hour
going through seeds earlier trying to pick
[SPEAKER_02]: packs of seeds to bring with me to trade
this weekend and because there is a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: swap on Sunday so looking forward to that
as well be good to trade some genetics and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what what else is out there I've got a
lot of genetics just going through stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: was kind of crazy trying to figure out you
know what I want to keep and what I may or
[SPEAKER_02]: may not actually get to it's only so much
room in the tent you know I think at my
[SPEAKER_02]: best run let me let me go ahead and pull
this up and I don't see any activity on
[SPEAKER_02]: the FCP on the YouTube side so let me go
ahead and pull this up but I I was
[SPEAKER_02]: counting you know how many cultivars I was
running a year and I think my one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: better years the most I did was let's see
21 different cultivars from 15 breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was that was even a little bit of
a stretch so you know 25 plants a year at
[SPEAKER_02]: most I possibly could get away with and if
you have 200 packs of seeds that's eight
[SPEAKER_02]: years right there and that's just you know
if I ran one seed from every one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: packs I might just have to you know at
some point in time I've always had this
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of just you know paying somebody to
borrow their facility for around and run
[SPEAKER_02]: as many of those seeds as possible to see
what to see what came out although you
[SPEAKER_02]: know with all the metrics stuff it's kind
of hard to see I don't think anybody would
[SPEAKER_02]: actually let me into the facility with all
those genetics because they have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: tagged you know they have to be entered
into the system before you could actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have them in the facility legally
depending on the state yeah right the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability yeah exactly like you said
depending on the state and certain states
[SPEAKER_05]: the traceability is taken pretty seriously
and in other states maybe one of the newer
[SPEAKER_02]: states coming online maybe would get away
with it under the radar sneak them all in
[SPEAKER_01]: there all right nothing from either one of
them so I'm gonna assume that the YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: feed is a no-go for tonight which is
definitely cuts into some of our crowd and
[SPEAKER_02]: so I apologize there for that and we'll go
ahead and we'll you know we'll have our
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation about rhizosphere and
phylosphere and this is recorded here on
[SPEAKER_02]: Clubhouse so it is possible that they
might be able to do something with it and
[SPEAKER_02]: throw it through the YouTube magic later
on make it available
[SPEAKER_02]: so rhizosphere and phylosphere so let's go
ahead and kick off with a little
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction you know the phylosphere is a
term used in microbiology to refer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: total above-ground surface of a plant when
viewed as a habitat for microorganisms the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere can be further subdivided into
the colosphere which is the stems the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylo plane the leaves the anthos fear the
flowers and the carp of sphere which is
[SPEAKER_02]: the fruits which is usually our favorite
part of it the below-grand microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: habitats the thin volume soil surrounding
the roots of the subterranean stem surface
[SPEAKER_02]: are referred to as the rhizosphere and the
Lama sphere most plants host diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: communities of microorganisms including
bacteria fungi archaea and protists some
[SPEAKER_02]: are beneficial to the plant others
function as plant pathogens and may be
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous to the host or kill it and you
know I think it's an interesting topic to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about the phylosphere we've talked
about foliar and we get into lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations around soil conditioning and
you know the soil health and the soil food
[SPEAKER_02]: web is a constant conversation but we
don't really talk about the phylosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: all that much
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf surface or the phylosphere harbors a
microbiome comprising diverse communities
[SPEAKER_02]: of bacteria archaea and fungi and algae
and viruses you know I know again we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot about the fungal bodies and you know
the need to put good things in your foliar
[SPEAKER_02]: sprays but you know one of the things that
I didn't learn until recently was that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could actually spray predator nematodes on
as a foliar as well and predator nematodes
[SPEAKER_02]: can actually be very productive in the
phylosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: in addition these environmental elements
affect plant physiology such as
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis respiration water uptake
etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: and indirectly influence the microbiome
composition water and wind also cause
[SPEAKER_02]: temporal variations to the phylosphere
microbiome again getting back into talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about insects and pests rain you know will
knock a lot of pests off of a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the type of pest it is I know
you know thrips are clumsy they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily hang on really well and
blasting plants with water is a great
[SPEAKER_02]: knockback technique you know it's not
going to solve your problems but it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good way to kind of break down some of
those populations and then coming in with
[SPEAKER_02]: you know some of the predators and some of
the sprays and some of the other things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you could apply to help with taking
care of that issue Nick sir how are you
[SPEAKER_05]: doing tonight yeah I'm doing pretty well
I'm doing well I just kind of missed the
[SPEAKER_05]: usual introduction I thought we were gonna
get the welcome welcome welcome and the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole introductory spiel but we launched
right into it which I'm happy to do as
[SPEAKER_02]: well yeah you know and you're right and I
was thinking about that part way through
[SPEAKER_02]: the as I was getting into the conversation
in the phylosphere and obviously this
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube thing is completely throwing my
game off tonight so welcome welcome
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome to how terms grow and tell and I
appreciate you for reminding me Nick that
[SPEAKER_02]: I do need to welcome people to the show
even if we are not being recorded in
[SPEAKER_02]: simulcast on YouTube tonight which we
normally are through the future cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: project we are still on the future
cannabis project channel here on clubhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess all of you get an exclusive
grow and tell tonight so I appreciate Ron
[SPEAKER_02]: and Mikkel and Laurie and big and Chiara
and Artemis and Caleb and Taylor as well
[SPEAKER_02]: as Drew and Dr. Chris and Jacob and Justin
who just joined us for joining us here on
[SPEAKER_02]: clubhouse because everybody else is gonna
miss out hopefully those who are normally
[SPEAKER_02]: on the YouTube feed and do use clubhouse
remember to come join us here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: clubhouse room tonight thank you for
joining us now that appreciate you coming
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb I see you're new to clubhouse as
well welcome to clubhouse and make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you haven't already that you click
on the little green house at the top join
[SPEAKER_02]: the future cannabis project make sure you
follow myself and Nick as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: other folks here in the room it's a great
way to build your follower list and find
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the other great contact content
that is on clubhouse so Drew for instance
[SPEAKER_02]: is commonly in the Wednesday K&F club so
you constantly see him taking part in
[SPEAKER_02]: those fantastic fermentation conversations
that we tend to have on Wednesdays
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate you for being here tonight and
of course Dr. Christ Dr. Christ who is our
[SPEAKER_02]: man in the future coming to us from
Aotearoa New Zealand always happy to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about hemp and farming and growing so this
week unfortunately we do not seem to have
[SPEAKER_02]: our normal YouTube feed as I mentioned but
we are recorded here on clubhouse so if
[SPEAKER_02]: you do miss any of the conversation and
want to replay it later please feel free
[SPEAKER_02]: to go back and replay the show and with
that I want to remind everybody that this
[SPEAKER_02]: is our Thursday cultivation club we are
here every Thursday at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific time to hear to talk about the
plant that we love ways to grow ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: care for it ways to grow it occasionally
ways to consume it and use utilize it
[SPEAKER_02]: although we tend to focus mostly on the
cultivation of the plants as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: different aspects of chemistry biochem and
biology that are going on within the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and also around the plant so thank you all
for joining us this week I do appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: you being here and for joining us every
week actually for all those who've joined
[SPEAKER_02]: us before this is episode 28 I believe and
actually let me bring up my list so that I
[SPEAKER_02]: get my numbers right since I did not
create my script tonight we are on episode
[SPEAKER_02]: 27 excuse me and we are talking about the
phylosphere and the rhizosphere tonight
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily that we're going to focus on the
phylosphere because as I mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_02]: intro I don't think it gets quite as much
attention as the rhizosphere we spend a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of time talking about the rhizosphere
things like the rhizophasic cycle and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know ways to to help get improved soil
biology and fungal balances and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that we don't really talk about the
phylosphere too much and I think that was
[SPEAKER_02]: a great idea to have that as a topic
tonight Nick hosting me with me tonight as
[SPEAKER_02]: always is my good friend Nick almost
always because he's actually not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be with us next week is my good friend
Nick from the rooted leaf how you doing
[SPEAKER_05]: tonight Nick is that better it is it is
it's much better I'm doing great as you
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned the phylosphere it's kind of
intriguing to me for a number of reasons
[SPEAKER_05]: first and foremost because studying the
phylosphere kind of represents the latest
[SPEAKER_05]: and greatest in like botanical
understandings like when you know people
[SPEAKER_05]: are studying plants and they say well how
do plants grow one of the things that's
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a hot topic right now is looking
in great detail at the phylosphere and
[SPEAKER_05]: examining some of the microbial
interactions and some of the relationships
[SPEAKER_05]: that happen up there so I thought it would
be interesting to kind of reflect on a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of points about the phylosphere and
then make some references back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: rhizosphere because there's some sort of
metaphor oracle stuff to understand so I
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like a lot of the people that are
here right now listening may already kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of intuitively understand what happens in
the phylosphere but it's still
[SPEAKER_05]: nevertheless going to be good for us to
create some of this connective tissue and
[SPEAKER_05]: then also you know there's actual hard
connections between the rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_05]: the phylosphere one of the examples would
be mycorrhizal fungi that funnel water you
[SPEAKER_05]: know to plants you know when it goes up
through their roots and enters the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: surface a lot of times the microbial
relationships and populations in the
[SPEAKER_05]: phylosphere can actually be dictated and
influenced is perhaps another more
[SPEAKER_05]: adequate word it can be influenced by
what's going on underground and the
[SPEAKER_05]: reverse is true as well that the microbes
and fungi in the phylosphere can kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: you know create substances and modify
sugars produced by plants and then release
[SPEAKER_05]: that you know back through the phloem
tissue out of the roots again and during
[SPEAKER_05]: the night time the the rhizosphere
organisms and inhabitants will sort of you
[SPEAKER_05]: know feed on that so it's it's kind of
interesting because nothing's really known
[SPEAKER_05]: in great detail except for the one thing
we do know for sure is that we don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: anything for sure it's like there's a lot
of information learning is kind of a very
[SPEAKER_02]: hot topic so yeah yeah looking forward to
it awesome awesome awesome I did just hear
[SPEAKER_02]: back from London and unfortunately he had
he had some personal stuff is just not
[SPEAKER_02]: available to do the feed tonight so maybe
Peter will pop in and we can get him on
[SPEAKER_02]: but unfortunately London is not available
tonight but everything's okay so he's all
[SPEAKER_02]: good but just not available to help us
with the YouTube tonight so yeah let's go
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead and get back into it you know I did
talk about a couple of points around the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere to kick it off right so you
know talking about the fact that it does
[SPEAKER_02]: harbor its own microbiome which to me is
is also you know it's obvious when we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about we often compare the rhizosphere to
the stomach in humans right there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole set of biology and bacteria in your
gut biome that is responsible for helping
[SPEAKER_02]: you actually digest the food and and
allowing you to get at those elements and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and but similarly we often also
have our own kind of phylosphere in our
[SPEAKER_02]: skin surface and our skin surface is
actually our largest organ in the human
[SPEAKER_02]: body is the skin and the skin is
responsible for you know all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: activity both inhaling and exhaling
different types of chemicals and signals
[SPEAKER_02]: and all sorts of different things that
happen in our skin surface and there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole biome and set of bacteria and things
that run around in our skin surfaces that
[SPEAKER_02]: also help keep us healthy and in some
cases aren't necessarily great for us as
[SPEAKER_02]: well so it's similar and and should be of
no surprise that it's similar with plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and plants have this whole microbiome
going on that is on the leaf surface not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily all about what's going on
under the ground and it's not all
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily just about the stomata either
I think that's another thing that we tend
[SPEAKER_02]: to focus on not so much about all of those
different microorganisms so you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions between plants and their
associated microorganisms and many of
[SPEAKER_02]: these microbiomes can play a pivotal role
in the host plant health as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: function and evolution interactions
between the host plant and phylosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria have to have the potential to
drive various aspects of the host plant
[SPEAKER_02]: physiology however as of 2020 knowledge of
these bacterial associations in the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere remain relatively modest and
there is a need to advance fundamental
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of the phylosphere biome
dynamics again just like you were saying
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick not only are we kind of just learning
about what happens with the phloem and the
[SPEAKER_02]: movement of these things there's also a
lack of knowledge about how this
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction works in the phylosphere yeah
yeah and to kind of piggyback off that too
[SPEAKER_05]: it's interesting because in the
phylosphere at least the changes that
[SPEAKER_05]: happen across the leaf surface are a lot
more dramatic and they're a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: intense it's a lot more severe in certain
cases and microbes are subject to a much
[SPEAKER_05]: higher degree of oxidative stress
particularly in presence of the light so
[SPEAKER_05]: in a lot of ways you know if you think
about the soil it's kind of like if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: a microbe and you're a fungi that's kind
of the place to be because at least down
[SPEAKER_05]: there there's resources and there's shade
and you can better resist desiccation if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're up on a leaf surface and you have
to deal with the harsh conditions that are
[SPEAKER_05]: present on the leaf surface which is you
know dealing with the air so it's high in
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen it's you know depending on the
humidity you're going to get desiccated
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty quick there's intense and direct
sunlight in most cases so it's a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: harsh of an environment and to boot
there's no carbon substrate you're dealing
[SPEAKER_05]: with the air so very very limited
resources overall very limited water
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients very high probability of
desiccation and oxidative stress so in a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of ways the phylosphere is like the
ultimate conditioner for microbes that can
[SPEAKER_05]: survive pretty stressful environments and
you know if you zoom in under a microscope
[SPEAKER_05]: you can kind of see like these these
microbes they're buttered up right next to
[SPEAKER_05]: plant cells you know they're kind of
sharing the same space they're occupying
[SPEAKER_05]: the same more or less like square
centimeter in fact i think if you took
[SPEAKER_05]: like one square centimeter of any leaf
surface you know if it's really healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to have hundreds of thousands
potentially even millions of different
[SPEAKER_05]: bacillus species then you may you may have
tens of thousands if not hundreds of
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands of beneficial fungi hopefully
hopefully they're beneficial but the other
[SPEAKER_05]: reason the phylosphere is kind of
interesting besides that is you know you
[SPEAKER_05]: look at the overall surface area of just
like hey i wonder how much surface area is
[SPEAKER_05]: occupied by all of the leaves on this
planet it's kind of like a you know crazy
[SPEAKER_05]: hypothetical question but think about it
there's a very large surface area that
[SPEAKER_05]: makes up this space we're calling the
phylosphere so the right microbes if they
[SPEAKER_05]: get into the space they occupy this
massive surface area across the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: planet they can kind of eventually start
to you know form their own specialized
[SPEAKER_05]: functions over time and this is something
that's i think going to start to be more
[SPEAKER_05]: and more evidenced that there are distinct
microbes that exist just in the
[SPEAKER_05]: phylosphere then there's overlapping
microbes that exist kind of both in the
[SPEAKER_05]: phylosphere and the rhizosphere and then
all you know also there's microbes that
[SPEAKER_05]: exist just in the rhizosphere and have not
yet been found in the phylosphere so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting to see this dynamic at play
and like i said part of it is just the
[SPEAKER_05]: intense environment and the conditions
that are present i also think the
[SPEAKER_05]: phylosphere gets a pretty bad rap overall
because most of the studies that have been
[SPEAKER_05]: done on polar surfaces have been from the
context of dealing with pathogenic fungi
[SPEAKER_05]: which is kind of casting the delicate and
nuanced nature of the phylosphere in a
[SPEAKER_05]: weird light when you're only studying it
because there's a disease present and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's imbalance present so when people
kind of go in and start learning about the
[SPEAKER_05]: phylosphere one of the most immediate
things is like oh you want to keep that as
[SPEAKER_05]: a sterile environment you want to kill
everything on it you want it to be
[SPEAKER_05]: perfectly clean and you want it to be
spotless and you know at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day stop powdery mildew yeah yeah so you
know it's like you have an imbalance in
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's happening and that you
know may lead to an overcorrection and i
[SPEAKER_05]: think that in a really healthy environment
your phylosphere is going to be strong
[SPEAKER_05]: just like your rhizospheres that's going
to be able to out compete any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens that are trying to get in so
yeah yeah um yeah the um yeah the the the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere micro microbes uh from
different plants uh from what i was
[SPEAKER_02]: reading um is uh you know there's somewhat
similar um in uh at the high levels of the
[SPEAKER_02]: taxa but at lower levels uh there's uh
different signif there's some significant
[SPEAKER_02]: differences between the plants so uh you
know as you were saying the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: has a big effect on it so whatever the you
know the microbiome of the environment is
[SPEAKER_02]: has a big impact on the types of microbes
that exist in that environment overall and
[SPEAKER_02]: at a higher level and a you know macro
level when you look at you know the the
[SPEAKER_02]: groupings and stuff a lot of it's the same
even between different plants because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just all over the environment and
uh but when you get down to the you know
[SPEAKER_02]: to the individual leaf surfaces on each of
these individual plants that's where you
[SPEAKER_02]: start to see some of the specialization
and as you were saying in certain cases
[SPEAKER_02]: where they've created an interaction or
there's certain cases where the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: producing uh compounds that tend to push
those bacterial things away like in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis you know terpenes are one of
those things that are used uh to help
[SPEAKER_02]: protect the plant that it releases in uh
in a way to help drive things away from it
[SPEAKER_02]: that are bad for it so uh it's it's
interesting that uh as you were saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that the you know the environment does
have an effect on it and and but you do
[SPEAKER_02]: have these different micro interactions
not just what's in the larger uh macro
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and um you know the types of
communities the balance of those
[SPEAKER_02]: communities is also different depending on
the types of regions you're in and um so
[SPEAKER_02]: you will have a larger um you know a
larger makeup of fungal bacterial in a
[SPEAKER_02]: jungle and tropical regions and a lot less
in a temperate region um or you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have less diversity in a in a temperate
region and more diversity in a jungle
[SPEAKER_02]: region uh because you have more diverse
plant species and animal species you're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably also by association going to have
a more you know diverse fungal community
[SPEAKER_02]: and bacterial community within those leaf
surfaces yeah yeah and everything you said
[SPEAKER_05]: there over the past couple of minutes
actually interestingly enough apply us to
[SPEAKER_05]: tea pretty well because there is a style
of tea called puer that is aged and
[SPEAKER_05]: fermented with microbes and if you look in
the literature you can see uh you know
[SPEAKER_05]: several studies have been done to identify
what is the microbiome and you know what
[SPEAKER_05]: species of microbes and fungi are present
and everything you just said right down to
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about you know jungle-like regions
that have you know even if there's changes
[SPEAKER_05]: in humidity changes in altitude things
like this um the degree of oxidation of
[SPEAKER_05]: the tea leaf obviously plays a big role
and there's two distinct styles of
[SPEAKER_05]: processing puer but you know without
getting too far into it the premise is
[SPEAKER_05]: overall that you know microbes and fungi
these are organisms that are highly active
[SPEAKER_05]: in leaf surfaces and you know if you look
specifically at puer it's basically just
[SPEAKER_05]: tea that's been harvested you know dried
in the sun and then processed uh you know
[SPEAKER_05]: further dehydrated sometimes it's pressed
into a cake otherwise it's you know kept
[SPEAKER_05]: loose but the idea is that these microbes
will continue to age on the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_05]: for decades and the longer that you let
them age the more potent the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_05]: tea becomes and so it's like it's almost
like the plants are producing certain
[SPEAKER_05]: metabolites that are going to get unlocked
over very long periods of time and
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly puer is one of those uh luxuries
that you know if you can afford something
[SPEAKER_05]: that's 30 or 40 years old um it's going to
be you know one heck of an experience um
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's interesting you know to to also
think that for cannabis plants there are
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps microbes and fungi that um you
know participate in very complex uh
[SPEAKER_05]: interactions on the leaf surface to maybe
deter pests you know to keep disease
[SPEAKER_05]: pressures at bay and ultimately maybe in
some more realistic or practical
[SPEAKER_05]: environments uh deal with light intensity
or to deal with dehydration you know
[SPEAKER_05]: things of that nature biotic and abiotic
stress i think is a is a big factor at
[SPEAKER_05]: least for you know commercial cannabis
producers and um you know that being said
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're also growing uh medicinally you
know having that uh population of microbes
[SPEAKER_05]: and fungi in check also i think improves
the sort of nutritional value of your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants overall if you do things like juice
you know with the leaves and also the
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutic qualities of the flowers
because you get those broader spectrum
[SPEAKER_05]: metabolites produced by the cannabis
plants you know particularly because they
[SPEAKER_05]: had these interactions with the microbes
and fungi um you know i think a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: times it's easy to you know easy to forget
that when plants produce secondary
[SPEAKER_05]: metabolites it's in response to something
and sometimes that response can be
[SPEAKER_05]: mediated by a relationship that's present
on a leaf surface or within the roots and
[SPEAKER_05]: the rhizosphere so yeah these things
ultimately come together to kind of create
[SPEAKER_05]: the you know broad spectrum flavor
profiles that we all know and love
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to produce yeah and uh like even
interestingly enough those microorganisms
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves have to even adjust their own
biology to their metabolic you know they
[SPEAKER_02]: have to adjust their metabolic rates and
stuff to be able to survive in many cases
[SPEAKER_02]: in some of these environments because they
can be harsh for for bacterial bodies and
[SPEAKER_02]: so they they need to even adjust
themselves so that they can survive be
[SPEAKER_02]: more fine finely tuned to survive on that
specific surface and i imagine that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: same case with the specific especially
something like cannabis that kicks out so
[SPEAKER_02]: many different types of terpenes and
esters and and all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_05]: types of chemicals yeah and you know it's
interesting that you know a lot of like
[SPEAKER_05]: the active pesticide ingredients are
actually in some cases derivatives of
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes that might actually be present on
the leaf surface like there's a bacillus
[SPEAKER_05]: subtilis qst 713 strain that i think is
called cease is the commercialized name
[SPEAKER_05]: and then there's also other products that
feature enzymes you know that are derived
[SPEAKER_05]: from the exact same species so it's very
interesting you know because you can take
[SPEAKER_05]: that approach which has shown efficacy you
know it's it's uh it's good to take a
[SPEAKER_05]: biological route like that but it also
kind of raises the question of you know
[SPEAKER_05]: well i wonder if we can do something to
set up the chemical you know equilibrium
[SPEAKER_05]: in the phylosphere such that these
microbes have access to resources that
[SPEAKER_05]: they need to you know have healthy amounts
of populations and prevent these
[SPEAKER_05]: infections from happening so that we have
you know we're not so reliant on taking
[SPEAKER_05]: reactive approaches but rather we can take
preventative approaches through good
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation sops you know having this
understanding of taking care of the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: and taking care of the roots i think you
know the more growers focus on that the
[SPEAKER_05]: better they become at growing healthier
plants and so it also kind of stands to
[SPEAKER_05]: reason that if you understand the complex
dynamic of what's happening in the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: surface and you strive to improve the
quality of the air and improve the quality
[SPEAKER_05]: of the environment in that leaf surface
for your plants i think you're also going
[SPEAKER_05]: to see similar results as far as being
able to improve the quality of the flower
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're growing the extract that
you're making and the overall health of
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants absolutely absolutely it's uh
it's really it's interesting to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about making applications to support the
protobacteria the bacteriodites the
[SPEAKER_02]: actinobacteria all the different types of
species or at least supporting the types
[SPEAKER_02]: of ones that are going to be the most
helpful and productive you know some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those bacillus species are definitely
known to be helpful in both the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere as well as the phylosphere you
know we talk a lot about lab lactic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria is a very very good foliar as
well it's it's fantastic many many old
[SPEAKER_02]: school growers have been known to dump
milk on their plants to help fight powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew and that's because the lactic acid
bacteria in the milk is helping counteract
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the powdery mildew and helping
create a better core microbiome for the
[SPEAKER_05]: for the plant yeah yeah and a lot of times
for plants the the ability to resist
[SPEAKER_05]: disease pressures like pathogens is
actually something that's mediated by
[SPEAKER_05]: other microbes other microbes like
lactobacillus acidophilus which i think is
[SPEAKER_05]: the the lab culture that you're talking
about those will produce compounds that
[SPEAKER_05]: will destroy the cell walls of pathogens
and they interestingly enough don't do
[SPEAKER_05]: that in all cases but when certain species
like pseudomonas for example that genus of
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes can be plant pathogenic and so
oftentimes if you have the correct species
[SPEAKER_05]: profile you've got good diversity of
bacillus species they can actually help
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of prevent that pseudomonas from you
know infecting the plants and producing
[SPEAKER_05]: harmful substances um that's the part
that's a little bit unknown and you know
[SPEAKER_05]: again this is a very complex thing to try
to monitor because you know it's so it
[SPEAKER_05]: requires such delicate instrumentation
just to be able to observe even for very
[SPEAKER_05]: very small periods of time what's going on
and what exactly is allowing certain
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes to mediate the interaction that
other microbes have with plants and if
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't get along well with the plant
then they basically can get their
[SPEAKER_05]: cytoplasm blown out um you know and this
is kind of more specifically how uh some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these compounds work is they they do
things like they denature the cell wall so
[SPEAKER_05]: they allow for the leakage of the internal
guts of you know the the microbes to come
[SPEAKER_05]: out and then subsequently get oxidized and
all the DNA gets destroyed so it's a very
[SPEAKER_05]: effective way of killing something else um
and then on the flip side too there's
[SPEAKER_05]: something uh along the lines of they
produce like sugars these
[SPEAKER_05]: exopolysaccharides that sort of make a
little biofilms very microscopic biofilms
[SPEAKER_05]: and these biofilms will actually prevent
they're like a little protective layer uh
[SPEAKER_05]: that prevents other microbes from coming
in and physically attaching to the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: cells so you can have a disease pressure
present in the environment but that
[SPEAKER_05]: disease pressure is going to be unable to
actually interact with the plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: infect it and get inside because this
biofilm formed by the protective
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial microbe in the phylosphere uh
you know it did its job and it prevented
[SPEAKER_05]: the bad guys from coming in and stealing
all the resources and robbing the bank
[SPEAKER_02]: basically yeah uh biofilm is um is a
really interesting topic in itself hey
[SPEAKER_02]: peter how you doing tonight i'm good i had
no idea we wanted to go live tonight yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i i apologize i was not good at
advertising this week but we are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to stay consistent and show up every
thursday so all right well i'll uh i'll
[SPEAKER_04]: grab this after and we'll put it up on
youtube but uh carry on yeah i appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: that and i apologize for my lack of
pre-notification to keep everybody in line
[SPEAKER_02]: that's my job i'm a project manager i
should know better and um so anyway thank
[SPEAKER_02]: you and and uh again uh you know i hope uh
everything is uh sending positive vibe
[SPEAKER_02]: london's way i uh and uh he's our usual
co-pilot for the evening as well i'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in the middle of dinner uh probably
with your in-laws or you're in the middle
[SPEAKER_04]: of cooking something no i'm cooking uh
yeah fantastic fantastic well thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: for being here and since we are uh past a
half hour mark we'll go ahead and relight
[SPEAKER_02]: the room and then we'll talk we'll get
back to that conversation about biofilm i
[SPEAKER_02]: was just about to to to mention um so this
is hote ervs groentel we are here every
[SPEAKER_02]: thursday night every thursday night
whether i notify people or not at 9 p.m
[SPEAKER_02]: eastern 6 p.m pacific uh we are uh
available and usually uh recorded in
[SPEAKER_02]: simulcast on youtube on the future
cannabis project fcp p o two channel and
[SPEAKER_02]: as peter said uh later on folks will be
able to go ahead and relisten to this uh
[SPEAKER_02]: through youtube or as you know you can
also relisten to it here in uh clubhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: if you feel it necessary to check back in
on some of the things that we covered
[SPEAKER_02]: already tonight um and as i said the folks
in the room tonight you get the exclusive
[SPEAKER_02]: live version everybody else it's just a
replay for tonight if you haven't already
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you click on the little
greenhouse and join the future cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: project and uh hit the you know hit the
little bell so that every time there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something going on you'll be notified so
uh back to it so as i was about to say
[SPEAKER_02]: biofilm is is actually a topic in itself
and it's actually something uh lighten
[SPEAKER_02]: talks about so i'm not sure if he's
actually done a future cannabis project on
[SPEAKER_02]: it already peter uh but biofilm is
definitely a topic i know lighten likes
[SPEAKER_02]: the talk about and it's um you know
biofilm is a very natural occurring thing
[SPEAKER_02]: i think people think about it uh in a
negative way because it does uh it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: slimy stuff a lot of the time right um but
biofilm is actually one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_02]: natural childbirth is actually better than
uh cesarean uh because of the biofilm and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the other things that come out as
part of the natural childbirth and so a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of time we think about these slimy
biofilms and things like that is a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: thing uh but in many cases they're a
really good and productive thing um you
[SPEAKER_02]: know in vinegars a lot of vinegars if you
have a good vinegar that has a mother
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll get a slimy rubbery kind of biofilm
build up on top and that's that mother and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's actually a living biological soup
that is part of the fermentation process
[SPEAKER_02]: and is part of that living body that's in
there so if you ever get like a bottle of
[SPEAKER_02]: dr bragg's apple cider vinegar or
something like that and you let that puppy
[SPEAKER_02]: sit out you're going to get that kind of
biofilm starts to form on it and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the mother what they call the mother and
you'll see on the label vinegar with
[SPEAKER_02]: mother and it means that there is some of
that in there to help kind of form that
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool uh bio slime or biofilm yeah
that biofilm is interesting too because
[SPEAKER_05]: you know like i mentioned earlier if you
just consider how harsh the phyllosphere
[SPEAKER_05]: is as an environment it does a good job of
you know conditioning the microbes that
[SPEAKER_05]: can resist major swings and fluctuations
uh in temperature and humidity and light
[SPEAKER_05]: intensity um so it kind of stands to
reason that part of you know the the
[SPEAKER_05]: evolutionary advantage of biofilms may
actually be in creating a more stable
[SPEAKER_05]: environment for the microbes and certainly
enough if you kind of look more
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically at some of the properties and
some of the benefits that these biofilms
[SPEAKER_05]: have they do help offset some of the
stressors of dehydration for example or
[SPEAKER_05]: desiccation which is very common in the
leaf surface uh whereas in the roots
[SPEAKER_05]: ideally you know the the microbes that are
in the roots don't have to deal with
[SPEAKER_05]: dehydration or desiccation stress nearly
as much and then furthermore because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: also a nutrient deplete environment you
know the phyllosphere is not the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no minerals you know there's
there's no nutrients present the microbes
[SPEAKER_05]: have to do with very very little and so
part of the benefit of these biofilms is
[SPEAKER_05]: that they can act as many nutrient stores
uh for microbes and so they can you know
[SPEAKER_05]: be accessed at later times to help pull
out certain resources while at the same
[SPEAKER_05]: time they can kind of you know act like
sponges to soak up extra water and help
[SPEAKER_05]: store that so as the environment around
the microbes changes very rapidly they've
[SPEAKER_05]: got a little bit of a buffer that they've
built up to kind of help you know deal
[SPEAKER_05]: with that um like jason said the the topic
of biofilms is pretty complex it's one
[SPEAKER_05]: word but it actually uh refers to you know
probably a variety of different actual
[SPEAKER_05]: distinct sugars uh you know and in perhaps
the architecture of the way that those
[SPEAKER_05]: sugars are linked together is also
something to consider just like if we're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about humic acids or fulvic acids
the three-dimensional shape of a humic
[SPEAKER_05]: versus the three-dimensional shape of a
fulvic almost defines the differences
[SPEAKER_05]: between them even though they come from
the same parent material so in a similar
[SPEAKER_05]: way i think there's the structure of you
know some of these biofilms is something
[SPEAKER_05]: that um you know could be examined at
great length so it is definitely an
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting topic we won't get too far
into it but the biofilms that are formed
[SPEAKER_05]: on the phylosphere uh are definitely
formidable because they have to you know
[SPEAKER_05]: regulate these massive swings and all
kinds of different environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters oh caught me away from my mute
button um you know and and you know i was
[SPEAKER_02]: uh as i was reading through some of the
stuff on this interestingly enough um you
[SPEAKER_02]: know just similarly there is i know we
don't think about it but there is also a
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere on uh marine plants uh they
also have a phylosphere and they also have
[SPEAKER_02]: the same uh types of epiphytic bacteria
that's found in the marine environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: um exists on that surfaces and i imagine
they could not exist on those surfaces
[SPEAKER_02]: without a biofilm that would allow them to
attach in those extreme environments i
[SPEAKER_02]: mean talking about being in an extreme
environment um probably more moisture as
[SPEAKER_02]: you were saying earlier they don't
necessarily have to worry as much about
[SPEAKER_02]: drying out although the the effect of the
salt waters on their uh bodies might be
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting but in the uh in the marine
environment they have a role they're
[SPEAKER_02]: thought to have a role in the nitrogen
cycle so um you know without uh epiphytic
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria playing a role um you might not
necessarily be getting as much nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_02]: uh marine plants uh they're not able to
pull that you know atmospheric nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: out that our land-based plants love to
utilize yeah yeah the sea plants are are
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting you know they uh do it's
interesting because i think there are some
[SPEAKER_05]: um you know there's some differences but
there's also some similarities in the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbial populations that you can find on
um sea plants and versus land plants too
[SPEAKER_05]: and in a lot of cases you know the sea
plants are producing certain types of
[SPEAKER_05]: sugars that do a really good job at
resisting dehydration stress in case you
[SPEAKER_05]: know during high tide they get smashed up
on a rock and it starts to turn to low
[SPEAKER_05]: tide and you know they don't get pulled
back into water um a lot of sea plants
[SPEAKER_05]: basically have to deal with being totally
dehydrated after being completely
[SPEAKER_05]: submerged you know for hours and hours and
hours on end and rapid changes in humidity
[SPEAKER_05]: and salinity so part of this complex soup
of metabolites that are being produced in
[SPEAKER_05]: the cell walls of uh aquatic plants um you
know there's overlap with the the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbial species you know and in terms of
some of the enzymes that are being
[SPEAKER_05]: produced by these species of microbes and
with the land plants too uh it's
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting if you look at some of the
epiphytes like the some of the bacillus
[SPEAKER_05]: species in the phyllosphere of land plants
you see that they actually produce
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds that help recycle cell walls and
so they have like cellulase enzymes for
[SPEAKER_05]: instance to help break down old dead cell
material just like in the roots we know
[SPEAKER_05]: that there are some beneficial microbes
that will help break down old dead root
[SPEAKER_05]: material and convert it back into soluble
sugars and feed younger plants and help
[SPEAKER_05]: them create new root material so this
process of recycling uh is kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting to point out that the same
thing also exists in the phyllosphere and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's uh interestingly enough similar if
not the same microbes that participate in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same way it's very fascinating yeah
it's really cool i was i just kept uh
[SPEAKER_02]: digging deeper deeper down different uh
rabbit holes while i was reading reading
[SPEAKER_02]: through some of this because again um most
of my focus and and a lot of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that i've read about uh tend to focus on
the soil the rhizosphere uh how do we get
[SPEAKER_02]: you know how do we improve the fungal and
the bacterial bodies and how do those
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions work and all those things and
again we we don't necessarily focus too
[SPEAKER_02]: much on the uh types of bacterial and
fungal uh life that exists on the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: surface and so it's definitely something
that's important bio biofilm is also you
[SPEAKER_02]: know important again talking about the
rhizosphere biofilm is what helps put
[SPEAKER_02]: together those fantastic uh you know
underground uh combinations of of
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial bodies and biofilm and things
that help create actual soil structure uh
[SPEAKER_02]: so having having those um comp those
aggregates come together uh is what helps
[SPEAKER_02]: create really really good soil structure
um it's one of the things that as those uh
[SPEAKER_02]: you know get deeper and deeper and deeper
into the soil they help with the
[SPEAKER_02]: channeling of water and help you know
reduce um runoff and flooding if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: really really great deep aggregation of
your soil with all of these little tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: you know when you if you pull up a plant
you see all the roots are hanging down and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's those little clumps and balls of
dirt well that's all because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: biofilm and the bioslime there's things
going on there with the bacterial life
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening that's a sign of really
good healthy soil
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah and so much is dependent on this
you know communication of information
[SPEAKER_05]: between the leaf surface of a plant and
what 's going on directly underneath it
[SPEAKER_05]: because a lot of times um you know they
have to inform each other otherwise
[SPEAKER_05]: there's going to be a little bit of a
imbalance in the growth overall so it sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of stands to reason that a lot of times
the microbes that are going to be present
[SPEAKER_05]: in the roots are also present uh in the
leaf surface and i think you know maybe a
[SPEAKER_05]: more uh sort of common example of
something like that would be i think a few
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago maybe 10 or 15 or 20 years ago
even by now um you know there were some
[SPEAKER_05]: studies done on uh how trees in a you know
deciduous trees in a forest were connected
[SPEAKER_05]: through mycorrhizal relationships and they
basically noticed that if they applied
[SPEAKER_05]: something to the leaf surface or if there
was some kind of stress induced in the
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf surface of one of the species that
the message would somehow get transferred
[SPEAKER_05]: down to the mycorrhizae you know past i
mean this is like in the actual ground
[SPEAKER_05]: it's you know outside of the plant at this
point and then that signal goes to a
[SPEAKER_05]: different plant and the plant itself is
capable of responding in its own leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: surface by producing some volatile organic
compound or it has a change in the
[SPEAKER_05]: expression of secondary metabolites you
know now all of a sudden this plant is
[SPEAKER_05]: producing something to ward off the exact
same thing that this other plant is you
[SPEAKER_05]: know being contaminated with or being
attacked by um so you know it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting to watch how the this signal
is preserved across uh you know a variety
[SPEAKER_05]: of very harsh environments uh in a variety
of different kingdoms you know it starts
[SPEAKER_05]: off with maybe a microbe or a fungi in the
leaf surface you know gets mediated by the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant presumably somehow interfaces with
the plant's phloem gets loaded up inside
[SPEAKER_05]: of it takes a little ride down through the
phloem tissue gets pushed out of the roots
[SPEAKER_05]: and microbes and fungi there um you know
kind of pick that signal up and they can
[SPEAKER_05]: make changes with other plants that
they're connected to so it's a very very
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting concept yeah so and you know
to complement what we've um you know i
[SPEAKER_02]: know complementing the you know
rhizophagic cycle there's also a similar
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle that goes on with uh cyanobacteria
uh being able to um basically enter the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant through the stomata and colonize
that intercellular space forming uh loops
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh interest intracellular coils so
again this interaction with the bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: actually coming into the plant itself i
know when i first started learning about
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil food web it was you know the
bacteria they eat the soil and the things
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil the the elements the raw
elements and convert them over to this uh
[SPEAKER_02]: inter you know the into this uh form
that's readily uh acceptable to the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plant is available and can absorb
it but it's not just that right it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually deeper where some of these
microorganisms and bacteria are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: coming into the plant's cellular walls as
part of this process and then being
[SPEAKER_02]: expunged back out to restart the cycle
again and similarly there's some there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar interaction going on in both the
rhizosphere and the phyllosphere yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: and i'm glad you you know you brought that
cycle up because it's something that um uh
[SPEAKER_05]: you know sort of sort of shows how plants
can mediate and condition the interactions
[SPEAKER_05]: that they have with microbes around them
there are certain examples where microbes
[SPEAKER_05]: effectively have the ability to disarm
otherwise harmful and pathogenic fungi and
[SPEAKER_05]: the you know the exact mechanisms of this
are not quite understood but this pathogen
[SPEAKER_05]: is basically neutered for lack of a better
phrase uh and then the cell walls of this
[SPEAKER_05]: microbe are oxidized by the plant so it
doesn't have a cell wall and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: basically just um you know it's like jason
said it's within the plant and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: participating in functions like nutrient
acquisition uh uptake you know increasing
[SPEAKER_05]: the efficiency of nutrient uptake uh and
then through these cycles um you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: cell walls do eventually come back they're
reformed and then this microbe is kicked
[SPEAKER_05]: back out into the soil and so you have the
cycle that's occurring a lot of these you
[SPEAKER_05]: know maybe it's something that we could
have talked about in reference to
[SPEAKER_05]: potassium but a lot of these uh you know
particular um nuances they happen very
[SPEAKER_05]: rapidly and they're actually mediated by
potassium signal flux you know potassium
[SPEAKER_05]: fluxes that act as like signaling um
cascades basically and so you know you see
[SPEAKER_05]: a massive uh spike in the mobility and the
metabolism of potassium in conjunction
[SPEAKER_05]: with all of this turnover that we're
describing here um and i think part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability of plants to do all of this stuff
comes back to you know the fact that
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes and fungi are a lot smaller than
plants plants are very complex
[SPEAKER_05]: multicellular organisms they're very very
big and you know innately inherently
[SPEAKER_05]: plants have the ability to accumulate a
large amount of reactive oxygen species
[SPEAKER_05]: that's just kind of the name in the game
for them because they photosynthesize so
[SPEAKER_05]: when the conditions are right and
everything is dialed in for the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: they are able to basically treat this
reactive oxygen species generation
[SPEAKER_05]: capability like a weapon against pathogens
that come in and uh you know in cases
[SPEAKER_05]: where the plants need defense mechanisms
they can generate these reactive oxygen
[SPEAKER_05]: species like they will produce uh
peroxides they will produce uh singlet
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen free radicals and they'll basically
drop nuclear bombs against the microbes
[SPEAKER_05]: because again the plants have way more
stored energy potential than microbes do
[SPEAKER_05]: so this is one of those very interesting
evolutionary mechanisms and tactics that
[SPEAKER_05]: they've evolved over time to um help uh
achieve something that until just recently
[SPEAKER_05]: was actually very very elusive and people
um either thought it was impossible or you
[SPEAKER_05]: know did not quite understand um how this
process worked but you know we're starting
[SPEAKER_05]: to learn more and more particularly
probably over the past five to ten years
[SPEAKER_05]: about some of these processes where plants
can kind of turn on and off the ability of
[SPEAKER_05]: certain microbes that would otherwise be
you know pathogenic and produce toxic
[SPEAKER_05]: substances to the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i'm still uh i'm still you know again
geeking out on uh the amount of uh
[SPEAKER_02]: different interactions that are going on
within the plant constantly um and uh you
[SPEAKER_02]: know the the leaf surface the stuff above
the ground is just that area where um it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the area we see so you would think that we
know more about it but we don't yeah and
[SPEAKER_05]: just understanding some of the structures
you know just like when we're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about the roots and the rhizosphere it's a
lot easier for us to like draw a picture
[SPEAKER_05]: of you know a microbe growing on a root
here because you can lift the roots out
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can actually see that when we're
talking about something like a bacillus
[SPEAKER_05]: methylotrophicus that is growing on the
outside of the stomata pores it's a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: harder for us to just be like hey look at
this you know there's your that's your uh
[SPEAKER_05]: you know where your bacillus
methylotrophicus is growing but uh you
[SPEAKER_05]: know the point is ultimately that the
plants than the leaf surfaces they're
[SPEAKER_05]: actually very very advanced structures
biological structures that are uh home in
[SPEAKER_05]: some cases you know not only to diverse
species of microbes and fungi but also in
[SPEAKER_05]: particular cases unique and distinct
species of microbes and fungi and one of
[SPEAKER_05]: them would be i think um some of the
species of uh bacillus methylotrophicus
[SPEAKER_05]: that exist in the leaf surface there are
some that exist in um the roots and so
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not like it's only found in leaf
surfaces but um the ones that are found in
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf surfaces are unique because they kind
of populate this area that's just outside
[SPEAKER_05]: of the stomata and as jason mentioned you
know the only way in besides the cuticle
[SPEAKER_05]: uh unless the plant is damaged
mechanically um it is through the stomata
[SPEAKER_05]: and so as the stomata open and close to
allow for water to come out and for you
[SPEAKER_05]: know oxygen to come out some microbes can
kind of try to sneak in and so this area
[SPEAKER_05]: right outside the stomata is typically
populated by microbes like this
[SPEAKER_05]: methylotrophicus and they have a number of
cool properties one of them in particular
[SPEAKER_05]: for the methylotrophicus is that it
metabolizes the waste stream of the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: so everything that's being dumped out of
the stomata is basically like you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: junk or the garbage or the byproducts the
metabolites the plants don't find useful
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's interesting how there's certain
microbes that will take that waste stream
[SPEAKER_05]: from the plant you burn it as fuel and
then generate something useful for the
[SPEAKER_05]: plants like this methylotrophicus that i
keep mentioning is one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes it does produce valuable growth
compounds for the plants growth hormones
[SPEAKER_05]: it can feed nitrogen back to plants and so
it can help you know with nitrogen use
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiency for example and also with
nitrogen deficiencies it can kind of help
[SPEAKER_05]: correct that by you know better
metabolizing some nitrogen so there's all
[SPEAKER_05]: kinds of benefits associated with as i
mentioned earlier looking at the
[SPEAKER_05]: phylosphere in greater detail and
understanding you know how do we set this
[SPEAKER_05]: up to be the best biological environment
possible just like we currently focus on
[SPEAKER_05]: the root and we notice hey if we set up
the roots to do really well with a healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: bacterial population in a healthy fungal
community then the plant itself is much
[SPEAKER_05]: more resistant to stress and disease and
so we we should kind of take the same
[SPEAKER_05]: approach with the leaf surface to say
let's create this equilibrium where in the
[SPEAKER_05]: phylosphere we always have healthy
biological activity happening it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit different than the rhizosphere
obviously it's you know you can't just
[SPEAKER_05]: spray massive amounts of microbes on the
leaf surface it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: nuanced and a little bit more delicate
because it's such an extreme harsh and
[SPEAKER_05]: unforgiving environment overall but uh
yeah i do think there's a lot of like
[SPEAKER_05]: mysteries and magic to be unlocked there
in that in that uh little known about
[SPEAKER_02]: section awesome awesome stuff so uh we are
at just about at the one hour mark so go
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead and reset the room thank you all for
joining this is hota herbs grow and tell
[SPEAKER_02]: our weekly cannabis cultivation club we
are here every thursday night at 9 p.m
[SPEAKER_02]: eastern 6 p.m pacific and we are here to
talk about cannabis uh the plant that we
[SPEAKER_02]: love and ways to care for it ways to um
enjoy it occasionally uh but primarily uh
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how plants grow so that we
have a better understanding what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening with the plant and that will
allow us to hopefully create better uh
[SPEAKER_02]: healthier versions of the plant in our own
environments whether that is commercial or
[SPEAKER_02]: home cultivation and this group hota herbs
grow and tell was originally a was
[SPEAKER_02]: originally really a home cultivators
cannabis cultivation club most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: folks that used to come to wester and meet
on a monthly basis were primarily home
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators uh just getting together
sniffing each other's jars smoking each
[SPEAKER_02]: other's weed and talking about how we were
growing it what we were growing what
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders what you know what types of
inputs environments all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: things and um that's where the club was
born from it was born out of the need to
[SPEAKER_02]: converse with others uh having been uh in
the closet uh hiding uh for so long it's
[SPEAKER_02]: important that as legalization continues
as more people have access to legally grow
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis plant um that we spread this
knowledge openly and share this knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as possible so that others can
also be successful um a lot of this a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of the time cannabis cultivation has been
this mysterious art uh not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: because the plant itself is so incredibly
difficult to grow but because the legality
[SPEAKER_02]: of it made it challenging to share uh
fully um so we want to continue that
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing and i encourage you all to share
uh this information not only what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about tonight uh but you know with
others uh help others answer questions
[SPEAKER_02]: help people learn about the plant so that
they also can be successful in growing
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they're growing it doesn't
necessarily have to be cannabis a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the things that we talk about every week
tend to be uh very general especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking about elements in the way
that plants use them um we we definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about plants and their different
groupings and their different families uh
[SPEAKER_02]: and and some of the differences between
those but um it's important that we do
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to help spread education which is
why i appreciate being uh recorded in
[SPEAKER_02]: simulcast on the future cannabis project
fcpo2 channel so not only should you join
[SPEAKER_02]: that subscribe to the future cannabis
project and the fcpo2 channel both um but
[SPEAKER_02]: you should also check out all the other
shows not just my show uh and nick's uh
[SPEAKER_02]: fantastic uh information every week but
there's all sorts of really wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: people on there and uh you should
definitely go check out all of the shows
[SPEAKER_02]: on the future cannabis project peter also
does a fantastic job hosting some
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful shows i don't think i mentioned
peter as a host all that often because i
[SPEAKER_02]: always think of him as more of a producer
but he is also a fantastic host and has
[SPEAKER_02]: some great shows on the future cannabis
project which is his baby so i appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: you peter for being here and producing the
show and all the other great content you
[SPEAKER_02]: get out there uh and also just give you
the quick plug there is also a uh seed
[SPEAKER_02]: site so dagger gardens dagger dot gardens
definitely check it out there's all sorts
[SPEAKER_02]: of fantastic seeds out there if you happen
to be on future cannabis project make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: you hit the like buttons while you're out
there there okay enough shameless plugs uh
[SPEAKER_02]: and i appreciate you too absolutely and
and uh definitely i'll be plugging you all
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend at the regen conference although
i'm sure a lot of the folks there at the
[SPEAKER_02]: regen conference also uh know you um and
and so and appreciate the content that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're putting out there i uh also next
week uh i think i'm gonna have a mutual
[SPEAKER_02]: friend uh somebody who i actually just met
uh jesse uh who's doing a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: hvac stuff um i met him at nekan this past
weekend and uh so we talked about him
[SPEAKER_02]: coming on and talking about uh some of the
differences between humidification and
[SPEAKER_02]: dehumidification and uh some of the
reasons why you definitely you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily be doing both um i know he
said that he he's been on your show so i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: looking forward to that conversation
coming up soon very cool yeah and i will
[SPEAKER_02]: get a poster posted on monday as soon as i
get back from maine yeah we actually both
[SPEAKER_04]: of us deduced that you were probably
driving up to the to maine so we're like
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah he's probably driving up to maine so
that's why there's no show right right
[SPEAKER_02]: right no no i actually i'm heading up in
the morning um because i did have to work
[SPEAKER_02]: today and uh needed to take care of some
stuff and it's easier to be away from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants for two and a half days than it is
to be away from the plants for three and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half days uh on the watering cycle so i i
can soak the plants down in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: and then jump in the car and head up and
uh fortunately because of timing i'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get there probably about the time that
kevin jodry touches down at the airport so
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm going to pick up kevin at the airport
in portland uh on our way up to dresden
[SPEAKER_02]: maine uh for the regen conference so i'll
i'll be with uh dutch bloom and uh steve
[SPEAKER_02]: raisner our friend potent ponics uh all
weekend as well as chris trump and many of
[SPEAKER_02]: the other characters uh for the northeast
that uh frequent the show looking forward
[SPEAKER_02]: to seeing blue as well all right so let's
get back to it uh nick what else would you
[SPEAKER_02]: like to talk about in the context of the
phylosphere tonight well perhaps one
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting property point out would be
that the phylosphere when the biofilms are
[SPEAKER_05]: produced in the phylosphere it can also
help with water retention and also the
[SPEAKER_05]: absorption of certain types of uh foliar
sprays you know it's a very common
[SPEAKER_05]: practice for instance to use saponins or
surfactants or wetting agents when you're
[SPEAKER_05]: watering in the soil and similarly when um
certain compounds are being applied
[SPEAKER_05]: typically it's pesticides and fungicides
but also with nutrients uh people also add
[SPEAKER_05]: surfactants you know saponins maybe dry
from yucca or quila we're using licorice
[SPEAKER_05]: root that works great um but the idea is
ultimately that microbes too kind of do
[SPEAKER_05]: the same thing but they're kind of inside
of the plant they're in between the cells
[SPEAKER_05]: they literally exist their their cells are
buttered up directly against the cell
[SPEAKER_05]: walls of the plants they exist within the
plant and so these biofilms that they
[SPEAKER_05]: produce um can actually in a lot of ways
function to increase the solubility of
[SPEAKER_05]: water in case there's you know rainfall in
a natural environment or if the humidity
[SPEAKER_05]: is higher during a part of the day the
biofilms themselves can trap some of that
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture and prevent desiccation later on
in the day let's say the sun comes out
[SPEAKER_05]: fully and all of a sudden everything gets
really dry and dehydrates on the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: surface uh again the biofilms are really
unique in their ability um to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: modulate a very very otherwise unforgiving
and harsh environment for these microbes
[SPEAKER_05]: that have kind of specialized in some
cases over a very very long period of time
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome awesome stuff yeah i think um you
see a lot of um a lot of the cases where
[SPEAKER_02]: um it's helpful to do that um i know you
know this is one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying compost teas and uh applications
of uh you know korean natural farming uh
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to be very foliar based especially in
the in the vegetative cycle where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get as much good biology as well
as some of the minerals nutrients um onto
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant surfaces uh when we you know a
lot of the the base vegetative cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding uh tends to be a fpj which is a
fermented plant juice and that fermented
[SPEAKER_02]: plant juice is probably going to have some
of that surfactant quality to it
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you use i use a fermented
aloe myself um you have your uh your uh oh
[SPEAKER_02]: n which is an anti-pathogenic so you're
getting some of those healthy ethnic
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-pathogenic in there you know putting
some lab in there liquid acid bacteria uh
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know we also tend to use uh faa
which is a fish amino acid in the veg
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding so getting some you know some
nitrogen and getting some fish amino acids
[SPEAKER_02]: uh as well uh onto uh the leaf surface uh
as part of that uh foliar spray and um i
[SPEAKER_02]: think the other thing to remember with
foliars uh is that um depending on what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to do sometimes you it is
helpful to go back in there and um
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you're using some heavy
surfactants to get in there and and hit
[SPEAKER_02]: them again with just some cleansing water
uh in between to help uh mitigate some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that extra build-up over
[SPEAKER_05]: time yeah yeah and foliar surfaces are
naturally very complex um anyways you know
[SPEAKER_05]: there in a lot of ways they are set up to
accept and receive signals that are being
[SPEAKER_05]: emitted from the soil and you do find in
certain cases if you study soils that the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes that are in the soils do produce
volatile organic compounds that actually
[SPEAKER_05]: get airborne lifted up and then once the
plants have their stomata open that signal
[SPEAKER_05]: works its way up to the canopy very very
rapidly um the exact nature and mechanics
[SPEAKER_05]: of this um you know are still kind of
unclear but what is known is that you can
[SPEAKER_05]: induce some pretty powerful responses with
plants this way you can actually get
[SPEAKER_05]: hormone-like effects generated as a result
of these VOCs being produced and emitted
[SPEAKER_05]: um and naturally plants produce ethylene
which you know is gaseous so it kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: stands to reason that there are uh you
know interactions happening up from the
[SPEAKER_05]: rhizosphere uh to the phylose sphere via
the air whereas in the phylosphere most of
[SPEAKER_05]: the messages that are being sent back to
the roots are being loaded up in that
[SPEAKER_05]: phloem um stream so it's something that's
inside of the plant it's you know been
[SPEAKER_05]: solubilized and it kind of gets
transported down um whereas again the
[SPEAKER_05]: opposite is true with the rhizosphere the
phylosphere you can get stuff that is
[SPEAKER_05]: released from the soil and works its way
up so that that part's interesting too i
[SPEAKER_02]: was reading a uh an article earlier today
and i was trying to find it but um you
[SPEAKER_02]: know as you were mentioning the volatile
releasing volatile compounds um a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: um what they're starting to understand
more about and i've heard uh paul
[SPEAKER_02]: vinhortmann talk about terpenes being
released from hemp plants in the same way
[SPEAKER_02]: is that these volatile compounds in many
cases actually affect the environment um
[SPEAKER_02]: and as they are released into the air they
will uh in many cases reflect light and so
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefits from trees and forests and
things like that is not just about the
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon sink that they are but it's also
their ability to release these volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds and terpenes into the air which
helps actually keep the planet cooler um
[SPEAKER_02]: so uh in many cases these volatile
compounds are are helping with some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that cooling action um and i've definitely
heard paul vinhortmann talk about that a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of times when he talks about uh how
hemp can help save the planet in that the
[SPEAKER_02]: release of the terpenes and these volatile
compounds uh up into the air are um very
[SPEAKER_02]: very important for helping with the
overall health of the environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping temperatures cooler and helping
with the build-up and creation of clouds
[SPEAKER_05]: and moisture yeah you know that's
something we had talked about a few
[SPEAKER_05]: episodes back maybe in one of the earlier
episodes about how terpenes are basically
[SPEAKER_05]: the ideas terpenes are these you know
classes of compounds that mediate
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships across entire kingdoms and
in certain cases like if you're walking
[SPEAKER_05]: through the forest as the sun is rising
well the the trees are aware of this and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to start producing alpha
pionene and so this distinct odor of pine
[SPEAKER_05]: you can actually see if you're standing at
the right angle when the sun is coming up
[SPEAKER_05]: uh directly over the forest it's a little
bit more blue and this kind of like blue
[SPEAKER_05]: haze is actually the volatile terpenes
being emitted because as jason mentioned
[SPEAKER_05]: as the rays of the light you know as the
rays of the sunlight come in part of that
[SPEAKER_05]: energy is absorbed by the terpenes that
are being emitted by the pine trees it's
[SPEAKER_05]: it's actually a literal sunscreen that's
being ejected out into the atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_05]: so it does have this effect of absorbing
some of that excess energy and creating a
[SPEAKER_05]: cooler environment overall one that you
know soaks up some of that radiative
[SPEAKER_05]: stress that's outside of the frequency
ranges that the plants might want to keep
[SPEAKER_05]: active for like chlorophyll for instance
you know maybe they need to get other
[SPEAKER_05]: frequencies out of the way first and then
chlorophyll is going to be more or less
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it's going to have this uh paved
road to allow all the light energy to come
[SPEAKER_05]: in and to hit on a chlorophyll without
causing too much stress and too much
[SPEAKER_02]: damage so yeah it's very interesting very
very cool stuff and um most of those items
[SPEAKER_02]: are are coming from the phylosphere not
from the rhizosphere so the phylosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: again having a tremendous impact on the
health of the plant but also the health of
[SPEAKER_02]: our planet so really interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: that these how important the phylosphere
is and those interactions are for the for
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these different aspects again not
something we normally talk about or i
[SPEAKER_02]: personally focus on all that much i tend
to again talk about what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and how we prevent flooding and how
we improve soil health and cut down on our
[SPEAKER_02]: use and needs for uh for uh for chemicals
and things like that so it's uh it's super
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting um let's go ahead and move on
um and i did uh for damore i will get you
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly a link for the regen conference
into the chat shortly um but i i wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: get um i was looking to see if i could
find that uh that article that um and i
[SPEAKER_02]: did um so i'm going to go ahead and get
that pinned up into into the chat here um
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's cool uh it's good stuff and it's
cool because the global temperatures would
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be warmer if it wasn't for them
it's fitting that i was reading that today
[SPEAKER_02]: when we were going to talk about the
phylosphere so um very very good um so
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere obviously we've mentioned it a
couple times tonight and you know we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about the phylosphere without also
mentioning the rhizosphere uh which is
[SPEAKER_02]: where we do spend a lot of time chatting
um i know i do and um the rhizosphere is
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happening on the soil and down um
and primarily when we talk about the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere what we're talking about is
the area that's between one and ten
[SPEAKER_02]: millimeters away from the root surface uh
so the rhizosphere isn't everything
[SPEAKER_02]: underground the rhizosphere is this zone
of interaction and activity that's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening directly around the roots
themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: the rhizosphere is where the soil food web
interactions tend to happen the most um
[SPEAKER_02]: although as we mentioned earlier during
the conversation there is plenty of
[SPEAKER_02]: insects uh as well as bacteria and fungi
that do try to travel uh between those
[SPEAKER_02]: different zones you will find similar
bacteria and fungal life in both the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere and the rhizosphere um
different bacterial and fungal life uh
[SPEAKER_02]: exists in the back obviously in the
rhizosphere uh that cannot exist in the
[SPEAKER_02]: phylosphere uh as nick mentioned earlier
because it is a darker moisture place with
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot more biofilm uh than exists above uh
we talked a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizophagic cycle um when we were talking
about the different types of interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: between bacteria becoming part of the
plant um and that also is a really really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting uh interaction to me that uh
that was one of the things i think that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of captured uh my fascination more
with learning about how plants were
[SPEAKER_02]: actually taking up nutrients right it's
not just about them sucking up things in
[SPEAKER_02]: the water that they pull into themselves
so uh really really um it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting that those interactions are
just starting to be discovered but all
[SPEAKER_02]: those crazy interactions that are
happening in the soil are uh the primary
[SPEAKER_02]: place that the plant does get most of its
uh nutrients and food other than the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest macro nutrients uh of uh oxygen
and hydrogen which it's getting in the
[SPEAKER_02]: form of carbon dioxide as well as water
when it absorbs moisture and vapor where's
[SPEAKER_02]: the carbon at man you forgot the carbon i
forgot the carbon man the carbon is part
[SPEAKER_02]: of that in the co2 uh is part of that
interaction and the water uh and the
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon is is is you're getting the carbon
out when you break down that hydrogen and
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen did i get that correct at least
well yeah the gist the premise yes yes
[SPEAKER_05]: it's all about carbon you know it's always
about carbon it's always carbon's the yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: carbon's the uh the number one most
important and in fact even water
[SPEAKER_05]: metabolism revolves around the acquisition
of carbon plants have invented this
[SPEAKER_05]: process basically to suck carbon out of
the air and then over the course of 100
[SPEAKER_05]: million years they do this thing called
create soil and then they give rise to
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of thousands of different
potentially millions of different species
[SPEAKER_05]: of microbes and fungi that are found
nowhere else except for within soils so
[SPEAKER_05]: it's very very interesting to see this
process of carbon being recycled over and
[SPEAKER_05]: over and over again and it kind of makes
sense that when plants produce sugars and
[SPEAKER_05]: carbohydrates throughout the day that they
want to funnel those down into the roots
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of like uh store that carbon you
know because if it gets released back into
[SPEAKER_05]: the atmosphere um all of their hard work
was basically lost kind of a bummer if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're working all day and and all that
goes to waste so these microbes and fungi
[SPEAKER_05]: do a really good job at participating in
cycles some cycles take longer than others
[SPEAKER_05]: some are very very long like you know
decomposition cycles that create humic
[SPEAKER_05]: substances in the soil those cycles those
processes take very very long periods of
[SPEAKER_05]: time you know potentially tens if not
hundreds of uh millions of years to you
[SPEAKER_05]: know get to the spot where they're finally
uh at their terminal sort of metabolite
[SPEAKER_05]: point um so there's you know this vested
interest that all of these microorganisms
[SPEAKER_05]: and also plants collectively have to take
carbon out of the air and bury it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground uh as much as that they possibly
can um and all of them kind of help each
[SPEAKER_05]: other out with this process overall if the
plants need some kind of mineral nutrient
[SPEAKER_05]: then the microbes and fungi are highly
specialized to be able to go and do that
[SPEAKER_05]: for the plant and uh on the flip side
there is a little bit of a cookie or a
[SPEAKER_05]: snack or a cake as jason likes to say uh
in exchange for cookies and cakes cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: and cakes those sugars and starches the
exudites the the cookies and cakes is dr
[SPEAKER_02]: elaine um i i definitely you gotta i gotta
uh give her credit for that but it is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's cookies and cakes you you're
attracting the plant is releasing the
[SPEAKER_02]: exudites the sugars and starches that it
it uh knows are going to bring in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria and fungi that are going to be
important to helping it uh get at those
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and elemental minerals that it
needs to survive um which is also really
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating i i wonder um if there is a um
as we mentioned before you know the the
[SPEAKER_02]: there's definitely some compounds that the
plant releases to fight off um you know
[SPEAKER_02]: predators or pests and things like that i
wonder if there's those similar cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: and cakes being released in the
phylosphere to attract the appropriate uh
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria and fungi that we're not we're
just not aware of yeah yeah there's
[SPEAKER_05]: probably a very very complex relationship
too and then in some cases there's
[SPEAKER_05]: probably a concentration gradient like the
methylotrophicus bacteria that are they
[SPEAKER_05]: they like to hang out around the stomata
because they take the waste stream that
[SPEAKER_05]: comes out of the stomata pores and they
treat that like a food source and they
[SPEAKER_05]: pass stuff back to plants and so i imagine
there's that that beneficial street is
[SPEAKER_05]: two-way because the stomata themselves
represent one of the major entrance points
[SPEAKER_05]: for pathogens to be able to get into the
plants and so um you know whoever the
[SPEAKER_05]: guards are are probably being paid pretty
well to make sure that the environment is
[SPEAKER_05]: kept clean and all the bad guys get to you
know stay out i'll be being fed carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: that's right
[SPEAKER_02]: so um as i mentioned as we as we talked
about earlier i think you know similarly
[SPEAKER_02]: biofilm is super important in the
rhizosphere as well uh it you know as i
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned when you pull the plant up and
and you see those roots underneath and you
[SPEAKER_02]: see those little clumps of soil and things
sticking to the roots that is the biofilm
[SPEAKER_02]: and and that is those little interactive
environments as i mentioned that
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere uh it's almost like a mobile
rhizosphere at that point because you kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of took it with you but that um those
clumps those aggregates in the soil is all
[SPEAKER_02]: part of um they they stick around um after
the after they're no longer part of that
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere um hopefully the roots um you
know have gone down deep and the deeper
[SPEAKER_02]: those roots go uh as they go on their path
down into the soil they create more and
[SPEAKER_02]: more of these aggregates they make these
little pockets of biofilm and bacteria and
[SPEAKER_02]: roots and all of those other things as
they make their way down and that allows
[SPEAKER_02]: the chance of handling of water nutrients
and bacteria uh and fungi which are
[SPEAKER_02]: brought along with the water deeper and
deeper into uh the soil as that process
[SPEAKER_02]: happens they continue to start breaking
down the elements minerals nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are locked in those lower
layers of soil that the plants may not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily have had access to um so in
many cases some of the limitations that
[SPEAKER_02]: plants will run into is because they will
there will be some limitations to their
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to continue to go down further uh
directly down into the soil into uh
[SPEAKER_02]: expanding those channels for water and
nutrients and expanding their rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: as they do that um and so those um in um
in malawi for instance there's a technique
[SPEAKER_02]: called deep bed farming that's being used
and taught by an organization called the
[SPEAKER_02]: tieni org and they've trained it's uh it's
over 10 000 farmers in this um technique
[SPEAKER_02]: of regenerative natural farming where they
um they have suffered because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and because of the western uh
farming practices that were uh forced upon
[SPEAKER_02]: them in many cases uh they basically have
developed this super hard pan uh this
[SPEAKER_02]: surface of soil that is extremely
compacted about a foot and a half down
[SPEAKER_02]: into the soil um and sometimes down as
deep as 15 feet into the soil and so um
[SPEAKER_02]: they are able to you know break up the top
layer of soil and get crops in but what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens is is that the crops aren't able
to put their roots down into the land deep
[SPEAKER_02]: enough for them to be able to create
channels for water as well as to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get at the nutrients and minerals and
things that are actually lowered down in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil not in this depleted area that's
above the hard pan um and so they are um
[SPEAKER_02]: they basically have to get in there uh and
break up that hard pan uh which will allow
[SPEAKER_02]: their future plantings to be able to grow
into that soil and by doing that uh
[SPEAKER_02]: they've um been able to farm without the
need for nutrients or any industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers and it has allowed them to
completely grow amazing forests of food in
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these really really tough areas
where they get you know like three inches
[SPEAKER_02]: of rain in a couple of hours and then
they'll go for periods of time with almost
[SPEAKER_02]: no water and so uh traditionally because
the the hard pan underneath and because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the way they laid their rows there was
lots of flooding which would destroy their
[SPEAKER_02]: fields and their crops or cause famine in
many cases um so that rises fear and being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to create a ability for the roots to
continue to travel down deeply into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil to develop a bigger and bigger rises
fear a bigger biome create more of those
[SPEAKER_02]: aggregates and then eventually leave all
of that carbon uh behind as well as those
[SPEAKER_02]: natural aggregates and channels for water
which helps more moisture and water go
[SPEAKER_02]: down into the soil as opposed to run off
uh running off your property and not uh
[SPEAKER_02]: actually allowing your um your soil to get
properly saturated yeah yeah that's part
[SPEAKER_05]: of the dance between microbes and uh fungi
and plants is that when the plants produce
[SPEAKER_05]: certain compounds and release them from
the roots it's kind of it you know in the
[SPEAKER_05]: best interest of the microbes and fungi to
find a way to pass that carbon as an
[SPEAKER_05]: energy source around back and forth and in
other cases uh to create human substances
[SPEAKER_05]: which contribute to things like the
fertility of soils and you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: longevity of um populations you know it
doesn't matter if it's plants or microbes
[SPEAKER_05]: or fungi anytime that you're building
organic matter into the soil you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to increase the likelihood of those
populations surviving whatever kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: changes are going to be present in that
environment so uh in a lot of ways as this
[SPEAKER_05]: bulk draw of carbon is going from the air
into the soil the microbes in the fungi
[SPEAKER_05]: are acting on these um carbon substrates
to help create in an environment that you
[SPEAKER_05]: know starts to take up a larger and larger
surface area and oftentimes initially this
[SPEAKER_05]: environment that i'm talking about is
actually just outside the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_05]: because if you think about it when the
roots themselves are growing the roots are
[SPEAKER_05]: um ultimately just sensing their
environment around them and their signals
[SPEAKER_05]: that are being fed back to the roots as
they're growing in real time because if
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a signal that comes back and says
you know dead end coming up here uh
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a rock immediately ahead there's
no way the roots going to grow through
[SPEAKER_05]: that you know there's there's this
feedback mechanism and part of it is these
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes are involved uh in sending these
signals back and so as the roots are
[SPEAKER_05]: growing and the root hairs there's the
like this little cap that's on the outside
[SPEAKER_05]: and it keeps pushing through the soil this
cap on the outside of this cap is a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of active microbes and active fungi
that are conditioning the soil just ahead
[SPEAKER_05]: of where the roots growing because they're
trying their best to make it uh
[SPEAKER_05]: ascertainable for the roots they want that
the perfect environments that the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: can grow there and they can uptake the
minerals and the water and so on and so
[SPEAKER_05]: forth because if the plant is able to do
all of those things then it can
[SPEAKER_05]: photosynthesize better which means that it
can produce more sugars and feed the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes and the fungi and continue this
whole process this very dynamic process of
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it's like in in a short time span
you have microbes and fungi actively
[SPEAKER_05]: conditioning soils to help roots grow in
the process of them actually growing and
[SPEAKER_05]: in some cases when we're talking about you
know several inches to several feet uh at
[SPEAKER_05]: a clip you know that's a lot of movement
that these microbes and fungi make but
[SPEAKER_05]: also it's true to say that humic
substances which take millions of years to
[SPEAKER_05]: properly form are also being sort of
conditioned and brought into existence by
[SPEAKER_05]: microbes and fungi the same ones that also
on shorter time spans and scales of time
[SPEAKER_05]: will um you know help microbes and or i'm
sorry will help plants grow and access the
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals that they need so this is a very
very dynamic dance that's happening back
[SPEAKER_05]: and forth
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me um yeah it's um very very uh
deep not to use a pun um so anyway uh it
[SPEAKER_02]: is 10 30 uh we are coming uh up on uh the
final half hour of the show this is ho to
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs grow and tell we are here in our
weekly cannabis cultivation club coming to
[SPEAKER_02]: you every thursday night at 9 p.m uh 9 p.m
eastern 6 p.m pacific don't want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: those backwards because then i'll be up in
midnight trying to do this show and uh
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard enough as it is uh some of these
some days to do the show from 9 to 11 um
[SPEAKER_02]: but we are here every week on clubhouse so
if you enjoyed what you heard tonight and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not already a member please click
on the little green house and join the
[SPEAKER_02]: future cannabis club project club as well
as give a follow to nick myself peter as
[SPEAKER_02]: and anybody in the studio audience tonight
uh because they are also obviously some
[SPEAKER_02]: plant geeks if they could sit here and
listen to us talk about the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: and the phylosphere for almost two hours
um so i appreciate every one of you for
[SPEAKER_02]: fellow plant geeks for joining us uh as
you most of you do every week uh we are
[SPEAKER_02]: recorded and simulcast on the future
cannabis project on youtube uh this week
[SPEAKER_02]: it will be as i mentioned a recording
they're not going to get the live feed we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have the live interaction
distracting me on youtube this week as
[SPEAKER_02]: well which is kind of nice that i'm
actually able to just focus directly on
[SPEAKER_02]: the conversation with nick and the topic
uh and not necessarily worrying about
[SPEAKER_02]: moderating some of the uh chaos that tends
to go on on the youtube feed uh in the
[SPEAKER_02]: background you never know where that
conversation is going to go uh off screen
[SPEAKER_02]: off to the side away from our main topic
of the night um so the you know i i think
[SPEAKER_02]: we've uh covered a lot of different
aspects about both of those different
[SPEAKER_02]: zones uh and the importance of thinking
about the bacterial fungal needs of those
[SPEAKER_02]: different zones um the different
interactions that um are just being
[SPEAKER_02]: uncovered in many cases in many in many
ways um you know again with the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere i think you know tilling is
another uh thing that most unfortunately
[SPEAKER_02]: most commercial growers are not aware of
how damaging tilling is to the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: um being able to support those healthy
biomes is super important and you know i
[SPEAKER_02]: think tilling when people started tilling
um and in many in some cases if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing low tilling um or really just doing
tilling to kind of break up the soil with
[SPEAKER_02]: um more modest or manual um you know more
of a manual plow or a thing like that then
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably not as bad um you know it's
it's just part of the process of of in
[SPEAKER_02]: some cases uh creating a proper
environment for your plants to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful to get them going but when we
use these mechanized tilling methods that
[SPEAKER_02]: have these mechanical metallic spinning
discs uh that cut deeply deeply into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and spin and destroy everything they
come across what happens is it destroys
[SPEAKER_02]: that biology it destroys that rhizosphere
that biome uh kills the fungal bodies it
[SPEAKER_02]: kills the orthopods and all of the
fantastic things that are living in that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil along with a lot of that biology it
destroys those aggregates and breaks up
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that fantastic biofilm that's been
created um and is really really a has a
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendously negative impact on um on the
soil fertility and the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: probably one of the most damaging things
that we actually do uh as part of our
[SPEAKER_02]: normal farming practices um again i think
the initial idea around it probably wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: as bad um again just breaking up some of
the soil so that you can get planting in
[SPEAKER_02]: there but uh really tilling is just such a
destructive thing because it does destroy
[SPEAKER_02]: that rhizosphere as well as really just
expose tremendous amounts of carbon to
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen which creates co2 and then you're
just sucking all of that wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful carbon out of the soil and
letting it just go up into the air yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: and interestingly enough it's actually uh
being understood more and more nowadays
[SPEAKER_05]: that the impact of heavy tilling which
most people would just you know consider
[SPEAKER_05]: to be regular tilling but this like really
really heavy treatment of the soil does
[SPEAKER_05]: actually release stored carbon back into
the air and it does actually create this
[SPEAKER_05]: transfer back i mean plants spend a very
very long time and they put a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: energy into sucking carbon out of the air
so it's a little bit ironic how between
[SPEAKER_05]: cycles of plants we decide to come back
through and say okay we're gonna reset all
[SPEAKER_05]: the work that was done um and you know in
some cases like the relationships between
[SPEAKER_05]: plant fungi and microbes these things are
still being uh studied you know to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand them as they occur in these
small segments of these slices that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: capable of measuring like in a controlled
experiment for example this doesn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: speak to what happens when you don't touch
you know land for maybe 10 20 30 years and
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of research is of course being
done but it's very very um you know few
[SPEAKER_05]: and far between you're not likely to find
something as extensive and deep and
[SPEAKER_05]: historical as that and when you do uh you
should you know definitely hold on to it
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's an example of something that
you know was in the making for 30 plus
[SPEAKER_05]: years let's say um and and you really get
a chance to look at what uh what happens
[SPEAKER_05]: when you don't disturb something but you
just nourish and allow it to kind of grow
[SPEAKER_05]: and develop its own complexity and its own
maturity i mean get to a spot where you
[SPEAKER_05]: get this broad expression of microbes and
a broad expression of fungi and uh you
[SPEAKER_05]: know in a lot of cases you know the the uh
the depth and the complexity of these
[SPEAKER_05]: microbial populations is something that
should not be underrated as far as the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability of some of these microbes to
produce beneficial substances for humans
[SPEAKER_05]: too um you know there's a very very uh
sort of famous and popular uh compound um
[SPEAKER_05]: produced by fungi is a specific species of
fungus that was found in only a single
[SPEAKER_05]: soil sample in the world and has not been
found ever since and it has been you know
[SPEAKER_05]: uh very very helpful medicine it's been
something that has allowed for the global
[SPEAKER_05]: eradication of certain parasitic diseases
in third world countries and there's been
[SPEAKER_05]: over 40 billion doses of this particular
compound administered globally so far so
[SPEAKER_05]: uh yeah it's very interesting you know we
got to do a good job of taking care of the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil and the phylosphere and paying
attention to some of the very very diverse
[SPEAKER_05]: species of microbes and fungi that can
grow and really just screening them and
[SPEAKER_05]: monitoring them for metabolites that they
might be able to produce that are
[SPEAKER_05]: functional medicines for humans or you
know um biostimulants in agriculture for
[SPEAKER_02]: that matter michael welcome to the stage
thank you for joining us i see you are a
[SPEAKER_02]: reach a sustainable cannabis food and
alpaca farmer how you doing tonight i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing good i'm trying to be sustainable i
should put up there uh trying to close
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't we all yeah trying to close as many
loops as i can but so i'm a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer as well and i'm in uh raised beds
living soil and just going back to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you were i believe you were saying about
the damage of tilling you know i don't go
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tiller but are are you suggesting
that if you could just leave it all alone
[SPEAKER_00]: except for digging the hole where you're
going to plant the plant that that is what
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the best thing you could do
absolutely 100 percent uh those roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: existing structures are fantastic sources
of nutrients uh and minerals that have
[SPEAKER_02]: been you know sucked up into the plant and
uh though all those as i was mentioning
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier all those fantastic uh channels
and aggregates have been created so um in
[SPEAKER_02]: many cases uh using uh cover crop as well
to help protect the soil structure in the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter time and and the off months in
between your crops is also super
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial to to uh and then basically
just going in and chopping and dropping
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff and if you happen to you know
running your alpaca over those fields
[SPEAKER_02]: after you've done like a chop and drop on
those cover crops or just letting them go
[SPEAKER_02]: through there and eat that um they're
going to create you know they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: crush down some of that plant material and
and get it help enrich your soil further
[SPEAKER_02]: um so yeah no absolutely i would highly
recommend just chopping the chopping the
[SPEAKER_02]: stocks and leaving the plants in and then
just staggering your your planting pattern
[SPEAKER_02]: uh in a way where you plant in between um
i have a friend i can't remember which uh
[SPEAKER_02]: he awesome stuff online they have these
huge beds and um instead of you know
[SPEAKER_02]: actually even planting digging the holes
he actually has uh pots that have no
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom on them so it is a fabulous pot
that doesn't have a bottom and they
[SPEAKER_02]: basically just puts them into a open spot
on the top of the bed and the roots grow
[SPEAKER_02]: down into the bed at the end when he
harvests he actually leaves that pot in
[SPEAKER_02]: place chops the plant and then moves over
to the space next to it and puts the next
[SPEAKER_02]: plant in and does that rotation and then
when that second plant comes down that
[SPEAKER_02]: first root ball plant is taken away
because a lot of that underlying root base
[SPEAKER_02]: has then at that point been uh has decayed
and broken down and and you know if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: in a good living soil bed then the worms
and everything else are taking care of all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff as well so highly recommend you
taking that approach yeah that's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting we we're doing that cloth pot
tech for the first time this year we where
[SPEAKER_00]: we cut the bottoms off and we dug them in
a little bit but you know we still have
[SPEAKER_00]: some to plant so maybe we'll just try
leaving them right on on the top that's an
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting thought yeah and then just pop
the next one right next to it right like
[SPEAKER_02]: just go in between um you know uh leave
you know you you'll usually have space in
[SPEAKER_02]: between them and and just plant between um
and then that plant will be able to take
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage of a lot of that stuff that's
left over from that previous plant yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's a good idea to do like if you're
if you've got some compost teas and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: brewing up some microbes in that compost
tea it's a good idea to post harvest try
[SPEAKER_05]: to uh introduce like a a strong maybe a
concentrated dose of that compost tea
[SPEAKER_05]: that's very rich in microbes to the plant
that was harvested because those microbes
[SPEAKER_05]: are typically going to produce enzymes
that will help hydrolyze the cell walls so
[SPEAKER_05]: as the cell walls get hydrolyzed and
broken down um they kind of get repurposed
[SPEAKER_05]: as building blocks into sugars that are
solubilized and they they can you know be
[SPEAKER_05]: used for a number of different things
including to feed the next generation of
[SPEAKER_05]: plants or even better to just keep the
carbon stored in the soil in a soluble
[SPEAKER_05]: form and then just enhance the quality of
life for all the beneficial microbes that
[SPEAKER_00]: uh that are in there that's great my you
know one question i'd like to ask you know
[SPEAKER_00]: currently one of the things i'm dealing
with because i've built all my soil you
[SPEAKER_00]: know from the ground up and didn't buy
bagged soil and i used uh organic dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: manure from the local dairies and stuff i
now have this quite large population of uh
[SPEAKER_00]: roly-polys that are last year for the
first time they were actually up in my
[SPEAKER_00]: colas and i had to pull my crop two weeks
early you know because they started having
[SPEAKER_00]: parties up there and taking shots shits
and like causing issues so i'm just trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out the best way to deal with
these once ocean dwelling creatures that
[SPEAKER_00]: seem impossible to beat
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's um those are uh those are
pests that actually i have not had to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with yet um i've dealt with a lot of pests
indoors unfortunately and though that is
[SPEAKER_02]: not one of them i know that i know that
there is a jidam approach somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_02]: jidam approach to cover that specific type
of insect um so if you're looking at some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the the j-a-d-a-m organic farming uh
recipes there is a biocontrol one for
[SPEAKER_02]: roly-polys in there um i'm not really sure
what the natural predator would be that
[SPEAKER_02]: you would launch for something like that
um but it you know that's a type of uh
[SPEAKER_02]: insect that you need to probably deal with
multiple parts of the life cycle and i
[SPEAKER_02]: also would be curious if the addition of
predator nematodes would help with some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the earlier stages of life um you know
getting them down you know when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: they're kind of hatching as eggs in the
soil um or what i'm not quite sure what
[SPEAKER_02]: their life cycle is like how they're born
or hatched um so understanding the life
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle of the insect is usually a important
way to to deal with it so that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with not only um you know the adults
but also the larva uh and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: midlife stages different predators have
different uh will live in different zones
[SPEAKER_02]: during their life cycle so something like
thrips uh western flower thrips actually
[SPEAKER_02]: live in both the phyllosphere and the
rhizosphere during their life cycle
[SPEAKER_02]: usually we see the adults munching on our
leaves causing problems there being
[SPEAKER_02]: vectors for disease and other problems as
you said leaving waste um but the thrips
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves the they laid the eggs on the
on the leet on the undersides of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves and then the eggs when they hatch
they fall down into the soil and so to
[SPEAKER_02]: truly deal with um thrips uh you need to
deal with them in both the phyllosphere
[SPEAKER_02]: and the rhizosphere um and so you need to
treat them with a combination of different
[SPEAKER_02]: types of predators to deal with those
different sets um stratiolalap is also
[SPEAKER_02]: something that comes to mind michael
because uh those are also a ground uh a
[SPEAKER_02]: surface dweller stratiolalap uh rove
beetles delotia um but um i think possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those predator nematodes as well
predator nematodes i mentioned earlier can
[SPEAKER_02]: also be sprayed uh so predator nematodes
can uh attack some of those pests while
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in the phyllosphere not just um i
know most people you think of predator
[SPEAKER_02]: nematodes they think about putting them
into the rhizosphere but they can be
[SPEAKER_02]: applied in the phyllosphere um so in
addition to the dom i would check with one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the beneficial insectary sites um one
of the insectary sites like beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: insectary is one uh arbaco um and see if
they have some um recommendations you
[SPEAKER_02]: could also look for i don't know if he's
covered at peter uh but uh matthew gates
[SPEAKER_02]: has a show he's uh zenthanol uh so he's on
instagram under uh sync angel uh but he's
[SPEAKER_02]: also on the future cannabis project with a
ipm specific show which you might be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to check out and talk to matthew gates uh
to see if he can also help you with your
[SPEAKER_02]: problem appreciate it thanks for all the
info you're welcome you're welcome anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else down in the audience has questions
comments wants to come up and talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: anything we covered tonight on the
rhizosphere the phyllosphere uh or just
[SPEAKER_02]: some general stuff feel free to go ahead
and raise your hand and come up uh was
[SPEAKER_02]: there anything specific to the rhizosphere
that you wanted to get into tonight nick
[SPEAKER_05]: no i mean i think we covered most of the
things that we wanted to cover it seems
[SPEAKER_05]: like the phyllosphere is the one that is a
little bit unique for people you know
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully you heard about it it inspired
you to think a little bit about um what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on up there and then you know maybe
how it's connected to the rhizosphere
[SPEAKER_05]: physically or also metaphorically you know
there's a saying as above so below and
[SPEAKER_05]: this is one of those perfect uh instances
where it's applicable to say that there's
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of stuff happening in the roots that
is also happening in the leaf surfaces and
[SPEAKER_05]: in a similar way i think the uh you know
the the trick will be to try to figure out
[SPEAKER_05]: how do you take good care of the air
quality for your phyllosphere just like
[SPEAKER_05]: the question has been how do you take good
care of your soil for the rhizosphere so
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah i think we got into all the things
that we wanted to cover awesome and brian
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you for joining us how are you doing
tonight sir uh did you have a question or
[SPEAKER_02]: comment i see you're a no-till living soil
backyard greenhouse cannabis grower in
[SPEAKER_02]: minnesota uh right no sorry or excuse me
it cut off the letters cut off and for
[SPEAKER_02]: some reason my brain went mn but thank you
in oregon uh how are you doing tonight
[SPEAKER_03]: brian welcome doing fine uh i had a
comment on uh the rolly pollies because i
[SPEAKER_03]: have i've had to deal with them in the
past uh i have a similar situation with
[SPEAKER_03]: the fabric pots mine are 65 gallon pots
but i did not cut the bottoms out of them
[SPEAKER_03]: uh i've had them for years and probably
like five years in my greenhouse which has
[SPEAKER_03]: a a bed of gravel underneath of it but
like i said they're not cut out anyway the
[SPEAKER_03]: rolly pollies the life cycle seems to be
independent of my pots because i've had
[SPEAKER_03]: i've seen them they come in and they come
out of the greenhouse they just uh you
[SPEAKER_03]: know they're everywhere but i've never had
a problem except for one year and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: the first year and i had no cover crop i
didn't know about cover crop and i have a
[SPEAKER_03]: similar soil like what this guy was
talking about where i mixed it together
[SPEAKER_03]: myself out of all the ingredients and uh
so that year i had problems where they
[SPEAKER_03]: were actually nibbling on the stocks of my
plants and uh that's the only time i've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever seen them on my plants at all because
since then i had this like a 11 seed mixed
[SPEAKER_03]: uh cover crop mix specifically for
cannabis and since then i've only seen
[SPEAKER_03]: them in the cover crop awesome really
didn't have a problem since then yeah i
[SPEAKER_02]: know um like mites love clover yeah
there's three different kinds of clover in
[SPEAKER_02]: this mix yeah yeah fantastic fantastic um
i i'm a big fan of uh of like vetch uh
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the grasses uh but yeah there's
definitely some nice mixes out there uh
[SPEAKER_02]: there's also almost every seed company uh
natural farming seed company like baker
[SPEAKER_02]: creek or any other ones they all also sell
um cover crop mixes that have peas and
[SPEAKER_02]: vetch and grasses and clovers and all
sorts of good things is is that uh that
[SPEAKER_02]: mixture using something that you come up
you came up with or something that you
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i i ordered it i found it online i
think i just searched on amazon it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: an 11 seed mix it has yeah i think it's
four types of clover but it does have
[SPEAKER_03]: hairy vetch and another kind of it has uh
beans some other things uh but what here's
[SPEAKER_03]: the thing is it seems like it's the it's
the canary and the coal moth fine for me
[SPEAKER_03]: because the only time you know i had
problem with mites before they came up in
[SPEAKER_03]: my cover crop and they never once got to
my plant that was when i had things under
[SPEAKER_03]: control not last year but the year before
that they didn't yeah last year everything
[SPEAKER_03]: went south because my blue mat system
somehow my reservoir went dry things just
[SPEAKER_03]: went off the rails and so i had russet
mites and spider mites so i think last
[SPEAKER_03]: year doesn't really count yeah prior to
that everything was in pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: equilibrium in my greenhouse yeah the um i
love the blue mats but um it is hard
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you let them go dry to get
them back to where they need to be you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to re get the soil back to that level
and then you got to redial in each one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those individual carrots and um it can be
a little bit of a challenge sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: working with those blue mats although i do
i do appreciate them and i think that is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably one of the best ways to keep the
rhizosphere happy is that uh you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: that ability to only give the right amount
of water to keep the right amount of water
[SPEAKER_02]: in the zone in each of those zones all the
time yeah i highly recommend the blue mat
[SPEAKER_03]: system especially the blue soak i have
both the drippers and the the blue soak
[SPEAKER_03]: tape and it works like a charm like i said
it's worked for me great for years but
[SPEAKER_03]: last year it was my own fault you know i
let the reservoir run dry because i shut
[SPEAKER_03]: the water off for some crazy reason and uh
other than that you know it's been great
[SPEAKER_03]: for me yeah maybe that's why the the uh
roly poly stay down there i noticed they
[SPEAKER_03]: like to hang around the the blue soak tape
so yeah the environment they appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: the most awesome stuff i appreciate you
joining us brian thank you so much for
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up sure and and i hope you have a
much better year this year definitely that
[SPEAKER_02]: time of year to get the get things going
absolutely and and you know with a 65
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon pot uh you're not that's not the
type of thing you're cutting the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: out of or moving for that matter so yeah
no there's no i can't i can't move them at
[SPEAKER_03]: all not having like a forklift or
something no yeah definitely not that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge pot um especially when it's wet
