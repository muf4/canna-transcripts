One, two, Westport, Chad
Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, Chad Westport here and we
are on day 28 of the Auto Pot Grow Diary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made a couple of changes this week,
a little defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also turned off the Auto Pot system so I
could top feed some dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cover that in a second, but let's go
in and take a closer look at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so here we are, we're looking at
Kool-Aid Man and as you can see I added a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of trellis here just to support
the growing buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big bushy plant all in that 7
gallon pot so you know what, it needed a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else in the tent was good so
you know I love this little deer fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rubber coated steel and I just hang
everything with twist ties off the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: off there and then actually over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a yo-yo, but again these are just
simple little grow hacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a full scrog net,
but this gets the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, let's take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is growing pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, day 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get a close up of some
tricone coverage on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's getting pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Kool-Aid Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this one is from Bee Leaf Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back here we've got the Twin Peaks,
which as you can tell I definitely heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliated this since last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see the bud sites now and
there's a whole bunch of them and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to form up pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to form up like little golf balls
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm digging that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Twin Peaks bitchin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's how that one's going right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got our Westport Grape Juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one in the back and as you can
see it's starting to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to put on some tricone
coverage and you know as the name implies
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting a little bit of purple as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the one in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got two of those in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Westport Grape Juice there and then
again coming in here in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what she's looking like right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, day 28 of flower for all of these
ladies and they are in the Soham Living
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a water only soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the changes I made this week is
I actually turned off the auto pots
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm going to top dress in with my
Kiss Organic Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one I actually already watered it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the auto pots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've added my dry amendments and I will be
watering those in shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're not going to bottom water
your top amendments in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the one change along with
this little Scrog Nut I made here and the
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But day 28 Westport Grape Juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twin Peaks and the Kool-Aid Man all
looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progress is moving right along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close up of the Westport Grape Juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The close up of the Kool-Aid Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a close up of the Twin Peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked with the way things are
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said, everything is kind
of starting to form up, frost up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frickin happy over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please continue to follow this Grow
Diary and keep it locked here on the Chad
