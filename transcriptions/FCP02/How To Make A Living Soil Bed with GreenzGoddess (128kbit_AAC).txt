[SPEAKER_01]: Hey friends Green's goddess here today I'm
going to put together another three by six
[SPEAKER_01]: foot fabric pop bed and I just wanted to
share with you guys how I'm doing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: case if you wanted to start growing your
own Cannabis medicine from home You could
[SPEAKER_01]: go with pots or you could go with a nice
big fabric pop bed If you're gonna decide
[SPEAKER_01]: to go with a nice big fabric pop bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me show you how to set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first Of all, we've got a nice three by
six foot fabric pop bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this from build a soil calm It's
made by grassroots The first thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to do when you're setting up a
bed is to Prepare for what's going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath because you're probably going
to experience some water runoff So what I
[SPEAKER_01]: built was a bed frame and it looks like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by two by fours It's a 78 inches
In length and these ones are 35 inches in
[SPEAKER_01]: width and then I got this material To help
all the rainwater come down to one area
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go to set up my frame see it looks
like this on the floor One thing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to keep in mind on one end You're
gonna have a little lip over the edge of
[SPEAKER_01]: this So that way the water can go over the
lip and it could collect into a tray in
[SPEAKER_01]: case if you wanted To much and then at the
other end I made one of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to lift it up Give it a few two
inches on one end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in case if the water comes down it'll
all go out the other end What I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: is just lift this end up slide that
underneath Then I'm gonna go ahead And
[SPEAKER_01]: take my huge fabric pop bed And put it on
top I Already built the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: together See how nicely it fits on top of
there it's perfect With these measurements
[SPEAKER_01]: you get like a few extra inches on each
side So when you buy this fabric pop bed
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes with these pieces it comes with
these pieces But what you want to do It
[SPEAKER_01]: actually comes with these pieces for your
corners you're gonna want to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrade Which gets you this piece if you
don't have it at your local Lowe's or Home
[SPEAKER_01]: Depot store This piece you could put
another PVC pipe going up and that'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: your frame that you would put your trellis
on So let me give you the measurement It's
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you're to buy the fabric pop
bed three by six from build a soil They
[SPEAKER_01]: don't come with the one inch PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go to the store and get it
yourself If you're gonna do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to take cuttings and I have it
all written down right here For your three
[SPEAKER_01]: by six fabric pop that you're gonna need
one inch PVC pipe for your legs You're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna want four legs Cut at 17 inches the
length.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four sides One two, three four
Those are gonna be cut at thirty two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half inches and then for your width You're
gonna want two pieces at thirty one
[SPEAKER_01]: inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in case if you're wanting to make your
own bed That's how you cut your PVC pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: and it all goes together like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: See Now we're gonna fill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me show you what I got Following
Layton's advice about the soil horizons
[SPEAKER_01]: first we're gonna start with rocks Then
we're gonna come in with some sand that I
[SPEAKER_01]: collected from the beach during my most
recent trip to California including
[SPEAKER_01]: crushed oyster shells I Got natural soil
from my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even went out to the mountains and
connect collected some natural soil from
[SPEAKER_01]: there Over here I have like these are
sticks old sticks from old harvest These
[SPEAKER_01]: are leaves from my avocado tree when they
died off.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are old avocados pieces from old
avocado tech So that's all gonna go in
[SPEAKER_01]: your middle layer Your very top layer is
gonna be your coots mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Got another video how showing how to put
your coots mix together You could use
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody's mix that you want to use You
don't even have to make your own if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to if you want you could buy
somebody else's I'm just showing you how I
[SPEAKER_01]: fill my beds
[SPEAKER_01]: Smells very nice All right Let's get
started Because I've been waiting all
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend to fill this bed I just wanted to
make sure I had all of my material so that
[SPEAKER_01]: I could show you guys how to do it Okay,
so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna go ahead and lift up this side and
put that Stand underneath it so that way
[SPEAKER_01]: we know this side of the bed is going to
lift up in case that there's any extra
[SPEAKER_01]: water It's all going to come out towards
the front of the room Think about when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing this where you want to
position your bed in the room once you
[SPEAKER_01]: fill it there's like no going back It's
gonna be full and it's gonna be really
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy All right, and I make sure that I
got my fabric pot in the center of my
[SPEAKER_01]: frame Perfect for ready to rock and roll
First thing I want to do Is throw down
[SPEAKER_01]: some rocks and go wild crafting for rocks
What you want to look for is smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces like this about an inch These
pieces are a bit too big but That one's
[SPEAKER_01]: got a lot of beautiful granite minerals in
it I only have about like a small handful
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces this big the majority of my pieces
are small like this The first layer is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be all of your rocks
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first layer only needs to be a couple
of inches tall maybe about three four
[SPEAKER_01]: inches Tall not too crazy If you're
looking at your fabric pot beds You'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's a white thing here helps
keep in the moisture and the water
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath that at the very bottom
Probably about three or four inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about your rock layer being a
little bit less than that
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that your whole
entire bottom layer of your bed is
[SPEAKER_01]: completely filled with one inch rocks
Okay, so I had to go back and get more
[SPEAKER_01]: rocks But here they are See how it's like
completely covering the bottom And next
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I'm gonna add is some sand So your
very very bottom layer is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: rocks and sand I
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that one has the oyster shells in it
I got this down from my most recent trip
[SPEAKER_01]: back home to Santa Cruz So it means a lot
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also found like this floating driftwood
Looks like a rock, but it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: really wood and it was floating in the sea
I thought it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably got to be filled with all
sorts of nutrients from the sea And plus
[SPEAKER_01]: when you put wood In your beds in the
organic layer, it provides a nice food
[SPEAKER_01]: source for fungi Which you want a lot of
fungi in your soil when you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis Spread it out like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this layer is rocks and sand
[SPEAKER_01]: See how I'm just kind of spreading it out
to the corners Making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that it covers depending on where you
live you'll be able to wildcraft a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff naturally I live out here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I Got clay soil, I don't got a sandy
soil so it stands all at the bottom Make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you spread it out And then after you
spread it out you get it nice and wet with
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit of water like the
sprayer I'm using the shower setting on my
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayer just to get it a little bit wet
Kind of helps compact everything down if
[SPEAKER_01]: you just spray it very lightly when you do
each layer
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing too much All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your next layer is going to be your
organic material now what I have is a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of I Have a bunch of old pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing living soil in the same
pots for a couple of years now So these
[SPEAKER_01]: pots have seen a lot of runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have high voices miles and
nematodes They're pretty much mainly
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly just worm castings at the bottom
of these pots since they're so small like
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 gallons and I've been reusing them so
many times This is why I decided to go
[SPEAKER_01]: with a larger bed because if I'm going to
be reusing my soil I want to have a much
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger Area for everything to grow and
move around in versus having all these
[SPEAKER_01]: individual little pots that I have to keep
picking up and moving this way You just
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the plant from the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this Big to the time it's ready to
harvest no picking up and moving things
[SPEAKER_01]: from one room to the other room So let me
bring in my pots and I'll go over all that
[SPEAKER_01]: This was old ten gallon pot reused many
many times It's had it's been amended it's
[SPEAKER_01]: got tons of castings it's had cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's had mulch all over it
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be my organic layer These
old pots and I'm also gonna throw some old
[SPEAKER_01]: branches from old harvest that wood that
we were talking about earlier for the
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi This is still soaking wet at the
bottom and I haven't even watered it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple days because There were no plants
in it But um Let me show you what my first
[SPEAKER_01]: one looks like You see how wet it is But
oh man if you smell this it smells amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: This I've always used Coots mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use whoever's mix that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go to store and buy a mix
There's a few companies that sell good mix
[SPEAKER_01]: all ready to go like
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this guy They need to wake up so I
got three of those that I'm gonna put at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of here
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now we're back Okay, first of all,
let me show you guys what I did I got my
[SPEAKER_01]: three Old soil pots that have been
Retailed recycled over and over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna make up my organic layer the
three pots three ten gallon pot So that's
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 gallons total This is what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wet pretty moist in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got like my worms my beneficial bugs I
already got my Organic Microbials growing
[SPEAKER_01]: one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the funny thing is while I was
spreading this out I happened to come
[SPEAKER_01]: across the corner and I told you guys
about putting a lip here so that way water
[SPEAKER_01]: can come out and What I did was I sliced
my foot going across the corner here and I
[SPEAKER_01]: had to go to the Hospital to get stitches
and I'm thinking I could have gotten this
[SPEAKER_01]: bed done Hours ago, but I had to put
everything on hold to go to the hospital
[SPEAKER_01]: and get stitches and I'm sitting there
thinking you want to wait if I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: make a video Showing everybody how to do
this a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean at least let it be me who gets the
stitches So I could warn everybody so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you guys copying what I do
and getting hurt from it So let me show
[SPEAKER_01]: you what I should have done this corner
I'm gonna get my favorite pair of scissors
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm just going to cut a curve
[SPEAKER_01]: Save that piece throw it in the garbage
don't want to step on it and Now I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: rounded corner No more slices on my ankle
No more visits to the doctor's office,
[SPEAKER_01]: please then I'm gonna get duct tape just
for added measure Almost happened again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay I'm gonna pin this down and I'm gonna
put duct tape all along the edge here as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as it's sticking out of the wood
you're gonna want to tape it up and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna put it all along the front edge to
Two pieces just to be safe Doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has to get the job done of not
injuring yourself as you're trying to work
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so now that I've shown that to
you guys Blood guts and tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it takes to put these beds
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out actually, I know a few friends
who have put in beds together several
[SPEAKER_01]: times and They had a hell of a time doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that this is easy at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not So with our organic layer,
we also want to add Native soil native
[SPEAKER_01]: soil I live out here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have mostly clay soil Soil has sand,
silt, and clay This is what your bed needs
[SPEAKER_01]: for its organic material Having sand,
silt, and clay is extremely important for
[SPEAKER_01]: redox potential I'm not really gonna get
into it because I don't know everything
[SPEAKER_01]: about redox potential, but there are a
million shows on FCP that they talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: redox potential mainly it's the Cation
exchange Right between positive and
[SPEAKER_01]: negative cations Something happens with
sand, silt, and clay that helps the redox
[SPEAKER_01]: potential and the cation exchange is
extremely important So I'm just spreading
[SPEAKER_01]: that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a five gallon bucket of Native soil
now Alright, so I had put in a five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket of native soil From my backyard
into here What I did with it to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that I wasn't getting any bugs is I dug up
a lot of my native soil And I just let it
[SPEAKER_01]: sit out in the big container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there was any bugs near they could
just crawl away Now the next thing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to add is a nice big scoop of soil I
had gotten from hiking in the mountains
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was found to near a tree with a
lot a lot of fungi growing from it So
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna be super awesome another
organic material I like to add sticks from
[SPEAKER_01]: old harvests I could have cut them up and
shredded them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably should have I don't really have
a lot of time for that right now So the
[SPEAKER_01]: reason why I'm adding sticks is because I
want to add any kind of woody material So
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of woody material that you can
think of that's what fungi loves to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: off I'm just gonna spread it around Even
if you're outside building a soil bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this outside too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Built my soil bed for my outdoors
tomatoes same way I used a lot of outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: wood that was already lying down
everywhere I used some lawn clippings and
[SPEAKER_01]: I use organic soil mix that with compost
and whatnot I have another bag here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also has the leaves from my
Avocado tree that I have when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: dead dying leaves it still has plenty of
Nutrients inside of it that can be taken
[SPEAKER_01]: up by fungi bacteria microorganisms worms
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love this I have a lot of skins from
old avocados
[SPEAKER_01]: And So I got some old bones I really
wanted to make Water-soluble calcium and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just never really got into collecting
enough bones to char them to do that And
[SPEAKER_01]: these have been sitting out for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured I'd just Put them in there any
kind of organic material Except for your
[SPEAKER_01]: avocado seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you'll end up growing a lot of
avocado trees like me But these are old
[SPEAKER_01]: Old rotten avocados these could go right
in there with the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it the worms eat up the avocado they
get together they start rubbing on each
[SPEAKER_01]: other and Having what some would call worm
sex
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in the avocados dig out the seeds
Avocado tech is typically done on the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: surface, but I'm looking for organic
material to put in this layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me show you what I got so far So I
just kind of spread out the sticks old
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves old food nothing too crazy Now I'm
ready for You could use anyone's mix that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to use I Like coots mix I made a
big huge like 60 gallons of it and Worked
[SPEAKER_01]: out perfect when you do it this way and
you stick your plants in You don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: have to worry about feeding it anything
your first round you just let nature take
[SPEAKER_01]: its course
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you guys don't want to see me sit
here showing all this thing But I am being
[SPEAKER_01]: very very careful because of the stitches
on my ankle right now Trying to be clean
[SPEAKER_01]: just showing you How we're getting this
done I'm gonna fill this bed and show you
[SPEAKER_01]: what it looks like when I'm finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey friends building your own soil You can
make your own mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coots mix
[SPEAKER_01]: This part is going to be the total value
of how many gallons you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve This is a percentage This part is
going to look at your total cubic feet and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how many cups per cubic feet of
your total mix so Where I live we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really have access to pumice or scoria so
in the place of that I use rice hulls And
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get some pumice from bonsai Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of this will be rice hulls though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also got peat I Got a biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that from build a soil was short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to get some more from the grow
store I Got worm castings compost as a
[SPEAKER_01]: mite oyster shell crab meal melted barley
basalt
[SPEAKER_00]: Gypsum and We're getting it all put
together 60 gallons Coots mix super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're all done mixing it you could
put it in the big fruit barrel and This is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it should look like
[SPEAKER_01]: Super super blended you can't even tell
the difference of all the ingredients that
[SPEAKER_01]: were put into here It's a lot a lot of
mixing There we go All right now that we
[SPEAKER_01]: got the bed filled with our 60 gallons of
coots mix We're pretty much done with this
[SPEAKER_01]: part as you can see I still got plenty of
space From where the top of this oil is to
[SPEAKER_01]: where my bed is which is fine Because over
the years as I'm digging out a hole and
[SPEAKER_01]: planting in a new plant It's going to
continuously add more and more as I talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to Dress with my mulch from the plants or
when I top dress with things like compost
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever It's gonna keep adding more
and more layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this doesn't have to be completely full
to the top right here It's good enough for
[SPEAKER_01]: now Let me just show you See cooks a
lovely mix all in there looking great nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and smooth What I like to add now Is some
compost to get any compost that you like I
[SPEAKER_01]: found a bag of this compost It works out
just fine I don't have too much left in
[SPEAKER_01]: this bag I'm gonna use what I have now I
might end up going to the store to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more I'll use what I have for now spread
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need too much It's just Gonna be
available for the plants when they come in
[SPEAKER_01]: here, so that's not gonna be for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways This is what I have left of
focaccia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also gonna get more focaccia I usually
would get focaccia either from growing
[SPEAKER_01]: organic or from focaccia earthworks
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good sprinkle it like that for now
I'm gonna go back and buy more compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: more focaccia And you really don't need to
add too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to add any at all This is
just my way of giving this bed extra boost
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plants also we have build the
soils cover crop blend I Like this Not
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody does a cover crop but on a bed I
definitely do not mind it So I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna sprinkle this cover crop on top Like
that I'm gonna get everything wet I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna come back with Probably just a tad
more compost and focaccia not even too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what it looks like now see And I
kind of want to like like that Sprinkle it
[SPEAKER_01]: around Get it going like this And you put
plants in here you really don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: add anything whatsoever you could just
water and go Let's see, yeah, looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: we're about done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna get my watering wand I'm
just gonna get my watering wand and get
[SPEAKER_01]: this nice and wet
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I put a bed together like this
Adding as much amendments as I added with
[SPEAKER_01]: coots mix You might want to let it sit for
a few days to cook basically what they
[SPEAKER_01]: mean by that is it takes some time for all
these amendments to get together and
[SPEAKER_01]: Coagulate and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a little bit too hot right now
to put plants in So you just want to give
[SPEAKER_01]: it some time to work itself out Together
It don't take too long I know sub cool has
[SPEAKER_01]: a super soil recipe that he recommends
that it be cooked for about 30 days Some
[SPEAKER_01]: people when you're looking at their
recipes that give you a recommendation on
[SPEAKER_01]: how long to let it cook for They mean how
long to let it sit all collectively
[SPEAKER_01]: together Anyone can make their own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it in the house Just keep in
mind that if you make it in your house
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna want a frame to put it on and
you're gonna want to tape up the corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put yourself like I did I have found
it pretty easy doing pots Growing with
[SPEAKER_01]: pots all my life to understand how to
water pots by weighing it You cannot pick
[SPEAKER_01]: up a bed and weigh it so the only way to
really tell if you're I usually look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants the plant leaves it starts
going down like okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a little water Sometimes I'll
just stick my finger right in there If I
[SPEAKER_01]: stick my finger in there and it's way too
dry, then I'm gonna water it Nothing too
[SPEAKER_01]: much I give it a little bit of water
probably let it sit for about five minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: come back and give it a little bit more
water because it just kind of takes time
[SPEAKER_01]: for all the water to go down so That's
about it for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna let this sit for about a week or
two and give it some time to cook and Then
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be ready to put my plants in Now make
sure when you have your room Set up for
[SPEAKER_01]: your bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna want to set your lights at
like a bench cycle at first while your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are growing tall Until they get
about I would say up to here And once
[SPEAKER_01]: they're about this tall, then you'll want
to switch your light cycle from When it
[SPEAKER_01]: must people have it at 16 16 hours on or
18 hours on No, I usually you do my light
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 20 hours of light for hours of
darkness, but You don't have to do it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do it differently when you're
going to flower You've got to do 12 12,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means 12 hours of light 12 hours of
dog So you put your plants in you let them
[SPEAKER_01]: grow until they're about this tall and
then you switch your light cycle You do
[SPEAKER_01]: that just on the timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy You don't have to pick up
this huge plant and then move it to
[SPEAKER_01]: another room, which is what I've been
doing for years So this makes it a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it makes my life so much easier
doing it this way I'm gonna get some
[SPEAKER_01]: lights in here to go over the bed You can
also do autos autos are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't got to worry about a photo
period with autos You got this huge bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got plenty of room for the roots to
spread If you get hooked up with a really
[SPEAKER_01]: great Auto breeder and you'll have some
really amazing auto plants, so we'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: how that goes Let me show you guys it's
just nice and wet I'm just letting the
[SPEAKER_01]: water take some time to sink down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all just wanted to show you guys
that oh Yeah, if you want to see my
[SPEAKER_01]: stitches stick around I'll take you into a
different room not in this room And open
[SPEAKER_01]: up my bandage and show you my cool scars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out All right now that we're all
cleaned up If you guys are anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: me and you don't like looking at cuts
scars Anything inside the skin or
[SPEAKER_01]: stitches?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is a really good time to click that
like button and go ahead and shut off this
[SPEAKER_01]: video But if you're a weirdo who likes to
look at scars and stitches I'm gonna show
[SPEAKER_01]: you the cut that I got earlier that got me
going to the hospital for stitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh This is so gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even opened it up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh You see that Safety first ladies and
gentlemen Make sure that you're cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: those corners and putting your duct tape
on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want a slice Your foot off of
the metal from that material trying to put
[SPEAKER_01]: a bed together the things that I do for
FCP Ever cease to amaze me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to give you a little update
on the bed so far I did put some lights
[SPEAKER_01]: over it and since I only need a light on
for the little seedlings I decided to go
[SPEAKER_01]: with just my 315 LAC for now I'm giving it
just a little bit of microbial tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to keep it a little moist As
I go through harvests I'm gonna chop up
[SPEAKER_01]: the stems and whatnot and try to create a
nice mulch layer Some of the seedlings are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to grow There are also some areas
where I had put the Bokashi that had
[SPEAKER_01]: started to create some fungi, which is
really nice when I get more Bokashi in I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna sprinkle it on top with a little bit
of compost and then I'm gonna put the
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch layer over that and then we'll
update you guys when we're ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant some plants and Hey everybody,
we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been two weeks since we've put this
bed in and so now we got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop growing We've got a nice
mycelium connection already happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went ahead and transplanted a few plants
If you're lucky you live in a state like
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado then everybody gets to at least
have six plants Or I've heard people out
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada at least get to have four
However many plants you want to put in
[SPEAKER_01]: their bed is totally up to you More plants
doesn't necessarily mean more yields
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can train them if you wanted
to So anyways, I'm just showing this with
[SPEAKER_01]: the six plants in the bed So first what I
want to do is get a nice little shovel to
[SPEAKER_01]: move it apart just a little bit I kind of
like saving the old woods going on But I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly just building a small enough hole
to put that in Try not to disturb it too
[SPEAKER_01]: much because One thing I like to sprinkle
down this is as those Beneficial bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprinkle this in the bottom of the pot
one spoonful You take your pot you squeeze
[SPEAKER_01]: it at the bottom that should pop out
easily I put Perlite at the bottom of all
[SPEAKER_01]: my pots so when I put a transplant then
it's easy to loosen it up and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots loose Right there roots make contact
with the Azos or any other beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that you may find Push it all
back into place make sure that my plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking straight up and if I move the lid
ceiling To kind of give you an idea of how
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all stuck together I like to put it
right back on top
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to put your tag to your plant
in case if you have a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains in the same bed I like to hook
this somewhere where it's not going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: wet when I water it So now that that's all
done some of my last steps are to Top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress just a little bit with some Okashi
Just a little all over the bed because
[SPEAKER_01]: this is definitely what helps get that my
ceiling going I also like to top dress
[SPEAKER_01]: with some compost This is Malibu's
biodynamic compost mixed with
[SPEAKER_01]: The final thing that I like to do with my
nutrients plants in the nice new bed I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to amend this I would amend
this if it was used since this is my first
[SPEAKER_01]: round No amending just compost and compost
tea Another thing that I love about having
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants in the bed is as I'm giving a
nice soil drench I can also give it a
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar spray That way this nice microbials
and the seed not only are growing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but they're also growing on the
leaves There's more than one way for a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to take in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way is through the roots and the other
way is on the leaves That's all I would
[SPEAKER_01]: say I probably lightly mist this like this
every other day Just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say this is probably one gallon We
think about how much soil is in here one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon isn't a lot and I definitely go
really really slow with the watering just
[SPEAKER_01]: like this While I was transplanting I
noticed this side was a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: moist than this side was so I'm just going
to keep that in mind when I water Try to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on this side and get just a bit more
attention That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
hope that helps you learn how one method
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways of how you can grow your own
cannabis medicine at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
You You You You
