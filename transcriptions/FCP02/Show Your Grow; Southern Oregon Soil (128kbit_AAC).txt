[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, how you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give you a tour of my garden
today in Southern, Oregon My name is Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go by the name Dozier Grower on discord
and Southern Oregon soil on Instagram I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go ahead and give you a tour
starting with the strains and the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pre-98 Bubba Kush from 2020
Mendocino She's about 65 days flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says she's just now starting to put on
some thickness and stacking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really good These next three
plants are gonna be from Humboldt seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company and they're pineapple muffin They
say about 45 to 55 days for flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking just a little longer Might
be because I'm further north and humble
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're putting on a lot of good
crystal a lot of good turps on them This
[SPEAKER_00]: is pineapple muffin as well And again
pineapple muffin by Humboldt seed These
[SPEAKER_00]: next ones are also Humboldt seed they are
all gas OG They all seem to be different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 55 to 65 days They are just
really putting on some weight now This one
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem to have any purple in it yet
this one is the biggest of them And she is
[SPEAKER_00]: just now starting to put color on and The
third one here has decided to just put the
[SPEAKER_00]: color on right away as you can see very
pretty color This next one here is gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles from Barney's farm and she is
doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's another 65 day 55 to 65 Definitely
leaning towards the gorilla glue side of
[SPEAKER_00]: it not really seeing any skittles colors
coming out but Her colas are really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: These next two are melon runts from
Elevate seeds really impressed with The
[SPEAKER_00]: smell And the bud structure on these This
is another melon runts and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are 55 to 65 days and Then these
last two girls down here are again by
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt seeds and they're stupid fruits
and they say they're at about 70 day
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time I need to clean them up a
little
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice putting on some really good buds
and colas
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see I like to clean up inside
the plants I'd also like to give a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to soil scape solutions I've been
using their foliar program not the
[SPEAKER_00]: complete program, but the nitrogen
phosphorus potassium the micronutrients as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the humic And I think I've been
getting a really really good response to
[SPEAKER_00]: it as you can see quite frosty have a lot
of ladybugs and The IPM has been really
[SPEAKER_00]: good this year I have a feeling that has
to do with some of the companion plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll get to here in a little bit but
again Really impressed with the soil scape
[SPEAKER_00]: solution for your feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it has helped immensely with the
crystal production and the terpenes So
[SPEAKER_00]: again big shout out to soil scape
solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go over my soil and my pots I am
using living soil this year I'm using a
[SPEAKER_00]: blue matte system with blue matte carrots
and blue matte soaker hoses I Actually am
[SPEAKER_00]: very lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will water that runs at about six five
pH So I can just run it right off the tap
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes into a PSI reducer, which I don't
let it get above 40 and then that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into a blue matte reducer, which takes the
PSI down to 15 then I've run the soft
[SPEAKER_00]: eight millimeter line and made a manifold
and It runs down either inside of the pots
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is two carrots in each pot
As you can see let's look under here
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of worms And as I say the roots do
grow up to the hoses so I'm using a straw
[SPEAKER_00]: cover as well as a clover I have basil I
have chamomile and I believe lemon balm in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a ant trap near the bases of The
trees because they that way I don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: any aphid problems from ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes straight for that I also have 18
inch blue matte digital monitors in pots
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it a little drier during flowering So
they don't need as much Again the hoses
[SPEAKER_00]: are in a ring
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see And one last thing you'll
notice is there are 200 gallon pots that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've wrapped with pallet wrap To kind of
mimic the grassroot fabric pots living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil pots To kind of reduce the
evaporation So that has been working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had a really hot summer up here
this year a couple weeks And over a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred consistently on the days and the
system worked really well the plants loved
[SPEAKER_00]: it and You know for everything said and
done with all the smoke and the hot days
[SPEAKER_00]: this year My first year living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's turning out fairly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I'm very impressed with The
process and I think I will stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions,
please get a hold of me
