[SPEAKER_00]: Hello again everyone and welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ken with Peace of Mind Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're finishing up the Moon Mountain
Kush across the Black Afrique and
[SPEAKER_00]: Headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very typical structure of an indica
about three feet in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniform spacing and well-worked line and
easy grow for beginners with minimal low
[SPEAKER_00]: stress training needed in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week or so into flower I did a heavy
defoliation and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find this to be the best time to get
your Sea of Green or your Scrog set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile of the cured flowers
matured into a soapy, fuely, flowery with
[SPEAKER_00]: a sour pine earthy finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: These flavors are very reminiscent of the
gold standard Sam Tashish I knew pre-911.
[SPEAKER_00]: A brilliant and complex heavy smoke for my
taste and experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This freeborn selections cultivar is very
heady, relaxing and sedative high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd suggest this is a bedtime or early
evening smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a patient I find this heavy OG leaning
cultivar helpful for insomnia,
[SPEAKER_00]: pain relief, spasm and inflammation among
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cultivar by freeborn selections is
good medicine five out of five for flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the Future Cannabis Project
and Mean Gene from Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freeborn selections, this is a cultivar
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make a great medicinal
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A taste the market has been looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to find it at daga.garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see it on a dispenser shelf,
get it before it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't last.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who have yet to experience
old school flavors, this is one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to daga.garden to check out more
freeborn selections cultivars.
