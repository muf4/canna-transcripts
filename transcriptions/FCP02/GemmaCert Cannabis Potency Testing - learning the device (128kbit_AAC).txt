[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Gemacert depending on where
you're from It's a near-infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometer that gives you cannabinoid
content readouts as well as Active water
[SPEAKER_00]: content and it's powered by Android.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this Android phone right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are gonna fire up the app and See what
it's like So I've got some weed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just something from a friend
unnamed farmer unnamed genetic Untested
[SPEAKER_00]: previously, but we're gonna test it and
we're gonna see what kind of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: content we can get first though I am going
to take a bong up out of my sovereignty So
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do is you place this nug on a
Magnet with a needle and that needle holds
[SPEAKER_00]: it in place For the spectrometer and then
the device does analysis just on the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nug I think you can also use ground flour
too, but primarily I've been testing it
[SPEAKER_00]: out like this so far So now I'm gonna open
the sample container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is actually Take this and
you pop the sample in there and then You
[SPEAKER_00]: close it Like this And then on the phone
you hit analyze and I've inserted my flour
[SPEAKER_00]: sample And then it runs analysis So this
is really interesting the analysis just
[SPEAKER_00]: finished and it gave me a notice that said
Low water activity which makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's some pretty dry bud We may
hit okay Click on our results Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it says we have to remove our sample
Some good bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely some good bud All right
Now let's check on our results Nice Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so our total THC for this one was thirteen
point two percent Total CBD was point two
[SPEAKER_00]: percent total CBG was two percent And our
active water content was under point five
[SPEAKER_00]: five I think gem assert is really cool for
doing the active water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important for You know
testing your crop to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: either don't have molds or you know
testing your dry or other things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: your cure but Yeah, cool advice And you
know, like I said thirteen percent THC on
[SPEAKER_00]: some Beautiful Beautiful dank bud It's
definitely not some swag guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is some good but So what I find most
interesting about this device and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going for another bonger up here but what
I find most interesting about this device
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it offers a Possibly more accurate
way to test your cannabinoids than to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to A lab that you know in theory is
inflating results to match market trends
[SPEAKER_00]: or hype Versus giving an accurate readout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at first I was and you know,
I'm not an expert so who knows but at
[SPEAKER_00]: first I was Astounded by how low some of
the THC readouts were but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my critical thinking side of my brain You
know basically led me to believe that This
[SPEAKER_00]: could be giving more accurate results and
the test results that we're used to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: high 20s and 30s could be a fabrication of
What the actual content is I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong But I've always had a sneaking
suspicion that some of those results are
[SPEAKER_00]: fabricated especially on the metric
recreational California market I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of consumers are Misled
and led to believe that high THC equals,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know good effects or high THC equals
quality or just you know Among other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know deceptive practices that high THC
is what you want to be looking for over
[SPEAKER_00]: any other factors such as you know,
the harvest date or the actual aroma the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes You know the quality of the bud
when you look at it things like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: matter more than THC percentage However,
we do think this is a really cool device
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're looking forward to doing more
work with it in the future testing metric
[SPEAKER_00]: strains doing comparisons Yeah,
it should be good but shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody for watching leave a comment
about what you'd like to see us do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the gem assert and Also, you know,
make sure you subscribe to future cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: project and future cannabis project Oh to
as well as budgasm and og is my option
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen on Instagram Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to you soon Almost forgot to take my
bong hit before we sign off here
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everybody You You You
