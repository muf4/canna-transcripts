[SPEAKER_00]: All right, a quick little fall garden
tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd start here with these
chrysanthemums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how they're all splotchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of rain lately and it's
like the rain has kind of washed the pink
[SPEAKER_00]: off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chia is flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butterfly bushes are still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a white one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like how it's all splotchy and it's
like it's being washed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big patch of lemon balm right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Brahma.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is why I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is so lush and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this video turns out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Tetragonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of seeds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can get down there and
show you some of these little seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: developing on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weird little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll dry out and turn brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually like four or five seeds
in all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it seeds itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large nasturtium patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been picking at all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been eating a lot of salad and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't even tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my parsley.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three different types right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parsley is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've actually reclassified it
into a vegetable from an herb because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrition in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's one of the things in
chicken noodle soup that helps you,
[SPEAKER_00]: those in the onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so yeah, this fern leaf is really
pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't remember what it's called,
but it's Burpee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put that out this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other fern leaves I've seen,
but that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little bit of weeding, but it doesn't
really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna help them make it through the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're gonna be big enough to
make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got radishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got black radishes right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finished radishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they make it through the winter
like they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the other side of the okra,
we've got the large daikons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, yeah, I've run these a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last through the winter and it
creates great chicken food, those greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just leave them in the ground and you
got nice, nutritious chicken greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some more carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a lot of carrots overwintering this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted a little late, but it's
Tetragonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably one of my favorite
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love BLTs in the summer and this is
lettuce that takes the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of lettuce, we got some,
I call this oak leaf, but they said it's
[SPEAKER_00]: salad bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go with what they called it,
but yeah, this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's probably not gonna last as long
as this one over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sylvia, I am very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name of that,
but the Sylvia lettuce is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last into the cold weather for a little
bit for something with such tender leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are heritage raspberries that I just
planted this year, this spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that they would fruit the first
year and they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, gonna have a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta pick all the wild blackberries
around here so that I don't have disease
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bit of a chore, but I'll get rid
of them eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mustard greens, great in a salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes sort of like kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same sort of flavor, same family and
everything too, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the seeds look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Bloomsdale longstanding spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are little white icicle radishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are delicious little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a little bit of spice to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it a mild radish, but they're
still spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back here, I did have peas, but I have
learned that even if you plant them far
[SPEAKER_00]: enough away to where the ducks can't reach
them, when they're young, they just sniff
[SPEAKER_00]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta do peas in the center of the
garden from now on because of these ducks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chopped a lot of the top of it off so I
can collect some nice delicious green
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a lot of this stuff and
it's really easy to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud of this basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you all have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
