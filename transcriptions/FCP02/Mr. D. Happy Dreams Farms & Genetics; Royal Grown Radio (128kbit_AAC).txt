[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everyone and welcome once again to
Royal Grown Radio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for tuning in and joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really happy to be here with a true
old schooler, Ben up here in Humboldt and
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout California cultivating
cannabis, doing breeding, exploring the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire cannabis culture since pre-215
through 215 and into the modern day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here with Mr. D with Happy Dreams
Genetics and Happy Dreams Farms who's been
[SPEAKER_02]: really pushing the envelope on modern day
genetics, helping bringing all the land
[SPEAKER_02]: race and original strains up to the modern
day threshold that people are seeing today
[SPEAKER_02]: where they expect you know these super
frosty super standout strains and really
[SPEAKER_02]: interested to dig into the history,
the many lives, the many pasts of Mr. D
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of get a little feel for what
inspires him to bring that energy to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Michael Beck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got Rick Elliott.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the infamous Mr. D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were just kind of meeting,
introducing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fun thing about Royal Grown Radio is
we don't always know our guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we do, but we really like to dig
into the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked on the phone a little bit to
kind of get a little bit of a primer to
[SPEAKER_02]: come in together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us all about how we ended up here
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What started you on the path towards
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Humboldt and how did we get here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a that's a pretty big one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I could say it's kind of like
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I was raised in Southern
California, but it was around pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the water dried up in the drought a
long time ago, the pools were empty and we
[SPEAKER_01]: skateboarded in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the early, early years,
my friends were actually literally
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimately Jay Adams, Jim Muir,
Dogtown, Tony Alva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still can't keep in contact with
several of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And poor Jay passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legend, Z Flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so skateboarding skateboarding led
to surfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surfing led into radical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radical was we were doing radical things
when all the kind of jocks in school were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sneaking off behind the bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go back and find our old my older
brother's weed stash and smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: skating pools and trying to get air and
surfing led to snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably is way back, 14 or something
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of those seeds I had we put
into the hills, you know, and planted
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like we were talking about some
friend earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those were funny plants,
you know, barely got buds dried up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on, it became like surfing,
surfing evolved around a lot of chill
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chill time was smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for me, I grew up, fortunately,
where I had like this really good weed all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a lot of it became like the
original OG as I got a little bit older
[SPEAKER_01]: and with snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was friends with the guys that had
the original OG in San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our friend Teddy, as an example,
he used to make these cookies and everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh, you got to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got Teddy's cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, don't even take more than a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even take a quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is long before the days of
pre-measured doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-measured doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then anyway, I had skipped through some
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had I was a surfboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made skateboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made surfboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brought out the weed, brought out a lot
of creative things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I threw different medication,
medicines, taking no pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines over 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through natural medicines, I started to
see things quite a bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a brand called IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: IG was more like, dude, I'm inhaling
ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you guys are doing,
but this weed I'm smoking is making me
[SPEAKER_01]: super creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start a skateboard company
and I'm going to have a surfboard company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make hollow surfboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make surfboards out of
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had all these different ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I opened a store when I was 20
years old and I had my own store,
[SPEAKER_01]: my own brand, IG Boarding Shop,
IG Surfboards, IG Skateboards,
[SPEAKER_01]: IG Snowboards 1685, a bunch of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all became around like the people
would say, hey, what's Critter?
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives up here now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend Chris, and he would be like,
what's Critter always carrying that box
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the car for at lunchtime?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the bong, the shop bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem we have is we had drug
tests there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you showed up with no weed in your
system, fuck, you were fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a pretty lenient policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been quite liberal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then fast forward to later on in life,
I had had times where I got injured,
[SPEAKER_01]: blew my knee out, like, oh, my surfing
career is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try that indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try that indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was like, oh, yeah,
wow, I'm pretty good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, one point in time I
told my life, I was like, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: move north and I'm just going to find a
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to live in the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to live with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to have generators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did live in a property with generators
for a year, maybe two seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right after that, I was like,
I got to get a property with really good
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental thoughts, lock the gate,
live in the trees, have my own spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until later with compliance that
I put the well in because I had so much
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what to do with it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're telling me I have to put a
well in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I live in the trees and lock the gate
and have a great life and not deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole society of the internet and the
computer and the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of ironic it's come all the
way around now with legality and
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first property I got was basically
under the 215 where I read the law that
[SPEAKER_01]: said you couldn't cultivate unless you
were a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cultivating dispensary,
cultivating yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had friends with some of the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually went in escrow together,
purchased the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so it was basically their
property and my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was the guy that would provide
the cannabis for their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I basically never got paid my whole
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grew a whole bunch of years, never got
paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so common back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all just grew it because we were
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because 215 was pretty much like
a donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were growing for the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started just putting in greenhouses
and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really into the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to have sun grown but with the
controls of the environment in the
[SPEAKER_01]: off-seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little heat in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little de-hums in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Protect against the September rains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did some full term runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly was into the greenhouse thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it went into like compliancy
and all that, I was always breeding seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing the different upgrades to try to
make everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a single twisty tire,
zip tire, piece of plastic on my entire
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably 40 acres of pristine redwoods and
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The county kind of liked it in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after going along for a while,
paying all the fees, they were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, we don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The road's not good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a tough one on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got into growing in the farm
lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: More in the flat, like homes flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned about dry farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing kind of a modified dry
farming for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a fascinating area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down there a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably meeting some of your neighbors,
I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a little bit about the magic
of that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how the Eel River kind of swiggles
through those mountainsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And creates this amazing farming
possibility that I really wasn't very
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I've later learned that
there's some vineyards doing that down
[SPEAKER_00]: south.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole technique just fascinated the
hell out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked so amazing and it was so
thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had food everywhere and herbs and
butterflies and bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole place was just, it really
was just as magical as it could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've always been fascinated to go
down there and kind of learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: how the plants can sustain themselves over
the course of their cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly got on to dry farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll talk about a lot of different
things today if we'd like to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the dry farming, it was pretty
neat with me because I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I had done some indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I originally grew outdoor when I was a
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying your fun couple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always had gardens and fruit
trees and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the indoor, you're like,
OK, I don't really feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the greenhouses became like,
OK, the greenhouses are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was doing greenhouses with lights
and power, no generators.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I bought a property in Holmes
strictly because that's the way the
[SPEAKER_01]: ordinance was going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, OK, this would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there I was doing light depth
with no lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just timing it effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planning at the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then no fans, no power.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was trying to do it more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I planted in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know anything about dry farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually bought the property there
not even knowing about dry farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Sunshine Johnson who told me,
yeah, we're doing this dry farming thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you should try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, try?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we really not going to water?
[SPEAKER_01]: So dig down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did like 10,000 square feet is what
the license was going to be for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did 10,000 square feet of greenhouse
hoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dep like 20 by hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did a separate area that was my
R&D testing area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was dry farmed completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants that I fussed with and
pruned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the hoses there as an emergency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watered the holes in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the neighbors had done that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's pure in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's moved closer towards it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the hoses out to lead into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, the dry farm plants did better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got better buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were more dense, even more dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants I had watered and foliar
sprayed and fussed with and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: picked leaves and stuff and pruned them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those didn't get as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we're just like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I transitioned into more getting
closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a back field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved triple R there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew like a big tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had it like, OK, we'll kind of try
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what came full circle was the
person I gave my first seeds out to was
[SPEAKER_01]: out in Shively Organic Medicinals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were more of the purists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an organic food farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still do.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Moon Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they farm all kinds of fruits and
vegetables and squashes and fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figs and nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do rotation of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were growing a smaller plot
of cannabis versus I had a smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: property with a big plot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really intrigued by how they
could just leave the plants natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their technique, though, was true dry
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could go into itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I went back over to Holmes,
every day I was like, man, even my hill
[SPEAKER_01]: spot, I got to get rid of this hill spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The county's probably right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we should just get out of the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be down on the fields in the
flats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be in the perfect place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even my home place, it doesn't
really work for me because it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like this place in Shively is
like the best place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pretty much decided I'll sell all my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prices were going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was getting too complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after I sold everything,
liquid everything, then Jane and Organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinals said, why don't you come over
and farm here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So well, you could get a license and you
can lease a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started kind of just helping out
and had a bunch of past due invoices to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to collect from first years of track
and trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 100% in on the track and trace and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like 25 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one was paying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was paying.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the distributors were basically the
middlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were hustling the hell out of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had all these people weren't paying
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided to kind of take a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up coming back then into
Shively and leasing a place out on their
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I grew alongside them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have similar views.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have the real pure views.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the purest of the best of the dry
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even over there in Holmes,
it doesn't compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holmes has like seven feet of topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Larabee has about three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shively has like 30 feet of topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shively is such a diverse,
like me, biosphere almost where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors have kept really strong to the
organics over the years and each other
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the sensei bolt down the street,
Humboldt flowers, and a few others that
[SPEAKER_01]: are there have kept strict on their
organic CCOF certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't even have to do pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature takes its course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a kind of a wait and see
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in the past, you'd see an aphid and
you'd be like, oh, my God, aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you like look at them and you're like,
OK, what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three or four days like, dude,
they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on day six, you're like,
someone's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming in and eating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions of ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they start breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, you're like, whoa,
I have more ladybugs we've ever seen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really neat out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that about the topsoil
layering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, these properties,
these places that we're talking about are
[SPEAKER_02]: down along the Eel River, along the banks
of the Eel River that had crazy historic
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding for eons before, but all the way
up into the 60s before they put the dam
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, like fifty three, like sixty
four or fifty four and sixty four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sixty four was the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no dam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what happens is the Eel River goes
out through Ferndale and a series of big
[SPEAKER_01]: wide bridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes out into the alluvial fan
out in the ocean out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a really big tides,
king tides, a really big swells,
[SPEAKER_01]: the surge of the swell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the moon cycle was a full moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the storm hit real big and the water
hit, you know, something like 70 inches of
[SPEAKER_01]: rain over like a week or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the water had nowhere to go because
the tide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just filled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in that Eel River Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the appellate,
as you know, you could have them organic
[SPEAKER_01]: dry farm organic missiles come back on and
talk about the forming an appellate there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the appellate, the Eel River
Valley, basically from like high rock just
[SPEAKER_01]: north of like the Honeydew exit,
Founders Grove in through up to like
[SPEAKER_01]: Stafford.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would include like Larrabee,
Holmes, Shively, Pepperwood and Stafford.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the floodplain area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the river backed up there and made
them deposited all the forest matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that organic forest matter from the
logging and the building of the freeways
[SPEAKER_01]: washed the complete towns out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it basically washed off the mountains
and then the finer forest matter settled
[SPEAKER_01]: into that Eel River Valley there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've read some history on it,
too, that it had snowed really low leading
[SPEAKER_02]: into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of snow on the
mountains and then that storm came
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it melted all the snow and logging was,
you know, really ramping up in that area
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so lost a giant hillside or two full
of trees and stumps and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just giant hillsides down into the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like eons worth of this ancient
redwood, fir forest soil just piled up and
[SPEAKER_02]: got deposited in that area of the Eel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really just super fascinating to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, having not had any
experience personally with dry farming,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I actually was speaking with
Sunshine just the other day on,
[SPEAKER_02]: came up and we had a really good
conversation and she was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of shedding some light on some of
that stuff and talking about water
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation and the droughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was coming at it from a
very different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing you and I were
talking about earlier is I've grown in a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of different ways, but I've never done
the dry farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I indoor, outdoor, you know,
all different styles of indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: all different styles of outdoor,
automated, organic, salts, hand water to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a really huge feel for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a lot of those folks out
there, you guys have been like steadfast
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on developing these techniques and
really improving this whole permaculture
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really speaks to me so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been touching a lot more on
regenerative farming and that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even though Rick and I work for
Royal gold and we sell soil and we,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, endorse however you want to
grow, grow in your pots, grow in small
[SPEAKER_02]: pots, grow in big pots, you know,
bring the medicine to the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just super fascinated by this dry
farming concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we both come from a pretty long sense
of background in, you know, caring for the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, trying to be the best humans we can
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that definitely leads, you know,
pretty deeply into how our food is
[SPEAKER_00]: produced and how we, you know,
we use this land and live off this land as
[SPEAKER_00]: gently as we can, especially, you know,
having kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to us to kind of guide our little
slice of the future into the right path,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big part of that is, to me, is
recognizing the influencers, the elders,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that came before us and
developed this stuff and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the culture that created these concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think it's really awesome
that you came out of this surf skate
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've focused a little bit on this
community and how integral it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and bringing cannabis to people
and kind of opening people's eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did all of these, you know,
kind of convergent paths start to focus
[SPEAKER_02]: your energy more on breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, I know you're farming
on all sorts of different ways,
[SPEAKER_02]: but really you were saying earlier that
your focus is more now on the breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what brought you back to that
passion?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, probably like six or so years ago,
it got to the point where it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the 215 was growing, the stores wanted
you to double up and double up and double
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the the engineers were sending
you these giant bills, as you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the the new 64 legalization,
you were like, OK, double up, double up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, OK, sign on the
dotted line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to have all this
square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a pretty good footprint that I
had signed on under 68.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, you know, under the new licensing
early out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became like, OK, so the amount of
time I was spending cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of time I used to spend on the
breeding all of a sudden went into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was spent track and trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in the early version of the track
and trace where you had these little tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: stickers that would rip off the zeros and
a oh, and a zero is like the same and the
[SPEAKER_01]: twos look like the five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, oh, my God, I can barely
see this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, so what happened is I started
to go like, OK, I cannot just keep doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this whole like depth scene, pulling
tarps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had like a strict schedule 703,
707, 711, you know, four minutes apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drive the motorcycle up the hill,
you know, 10 minutes apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that one every night, every night,
every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every morning, open them and the blowers
on them and the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we produced some really quality weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, I got some high
recognitions from even like the early
[SPEAKER_01]: district, like Sungrower's Guild as farm
of the year and highest terpenes and got
[SPEAKER_01]: like three out of five of the awards the
first year and similar the second year
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started to go like, I need to get
back to the breeding because like I had
[SPEAKER_01]: been fortunate enough to back in the day
have the connection on the original OGs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which then I was able to have those get up
here in the Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those became like the SFV and
TKOG basically got bred together and
[SPEAKER_01]: became like the Humboldt OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Larry OG kind of popped out
of that same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so when I started having some
friends come up, you know, they had
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution outlets, San Francisco area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had my good friend was, you know,
lived a couple of houses away.
[SPEAKER_01]: from Mario Guzman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mario, Mr. Scherbinski, you know,
so Scherbinski was like, Hey, I got these
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts, you know, I'll get you the original
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Sunset Scherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got this new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're calling it Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, which one do you think you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato 41 or whatever was the one I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like the sixth farm or something
to that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Scherbinski.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were going to be called like the
Scherbert tribe and have this medallions
[SPEAKER_01]: and all this funny stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: His manager was a good guy, Jay Lofty back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, fast forward is I basically
had an agreement that I wouldn't breed
[SPEAKER_01]: with any of those or do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had these really good OG seeds,
which eventually I crossed to into the
[SPEAKER_01]: gelatos and the Scherberts and the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also was like accumulating other
gear from people that I knew or had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when Track and Trace came about,
I had about 119 or 117 strains on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Track and Trace list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was literally tracking every one and
I didn't fake it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like, yeah, I've got this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started phenohunting like major
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be like, OK, well, I'm putting 500
plants and a 20 by 100 or even more
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, OK, so that's all
different seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be 500 of that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 500 of that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing like five to 600.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started doing a couple like thousand
plant hunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people were like, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, dude, I'm honestly tired of
like having to grow the weed, harvest the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, and then just have it go into a bag
and put a sticker on it so it can go into
[SPEAKER_01]: some metric system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather just work on the genetics,
work on the strains, work on what really
[SPEAKER_01]: people are looking at because no one was
looking at terpenes so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was seeing this correlation between
like certain terpenes if they hit like
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.4, certain ones that hit 0.2,
it'd be half of that, two to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were four to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like CBD, THC, I was seeing
correlations between, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maricine, humaline, you know, different
ones, linalool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sometimes my pronunciation
is different than certain people on some
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get mixed up with all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cariophylline or cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so I've seen these correlations
and I was trying to like devote,
[SPEAKER_01]: divest my brain or whatever the word is
into like understanding all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then all of a sudden I had like so many
and everyone's like, how are you doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I had a background where
I worked with numbers shaping surfboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a surfboard, it's like a curve
that's an infinite amount of numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're only measuring every 12 or
24 inches down a six, seven, eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: nine, 10 foot board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a curve, you have infinite numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started equating all those numbers of
like the cannabis plant and the piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: wood in the middle was like the stock and
that all those curves are all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people want a narrow nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want a wide nose and we want a
middle nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want a narrow tail,
a wide tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want a doubling swallow,
a pin tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those are the different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sacrificing so many pounds of money
and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was all, look, dude, the money is
the money that I'm trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what all these terpenes are doing for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized like the whole plant,
you know, has a array of terpenes versus
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud on the north side of the plant
versus the south side of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The east, the west, the higher,
the lower, same in fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's intrigued me with mixing the
farming with the cannabis is that all
[SPEAKER_01]: those elements come into play and it
hasn't got that far down the road yet with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just starting to turn that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really like really exciting to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting to watch the crop science
come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fascinated by that analogy that you
had with the surfboards.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, I'm like picturing three
dimensional curvature and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, moving the different terpenes
around to strike different balances and
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve different healing effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you know, different,
you know, psychedelic and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: different highs and flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a flavor person too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like personally, I think this massive
selection for only 20% and higher up to
[SPEAKER_02]: 30%, I think it's a disservice to the
entire lineage of the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: because the most unique strains,
most flavorful standout strains are
[SPEAKER_02]: testing at 16, 17%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really affect me just as
potently, but maybe not as couch lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the THC isn't quite so high,
but all that entourage effect is really
[SPEAKER_02]: important to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love that analogy of how that all
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's spectacular.
