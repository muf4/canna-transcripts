[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Callie High episode 32.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host, Chenzo Nico, and this week
our guest is reggae great Richard Daly,
[SPEAKER_04]: bass player and founding member of the
iconic reggae band Third World.
[SPEAKER_04]: He joins Callie High for an amazing
interview about his long career,
[SPEAKER_04]: his early days in Kingston, and he talks
about working with various producers of
[SPEAKER_04]: reggae notoriety such as Lee Scratch
Perry, Chris Blackwell, and Damian Marley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Daly speaks of memorable gigs and
staggering crowds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also talk about Third World's new album
produced by Damian Marley, and find out
[SPEAKER_04]: about classic reggae tunes that Richie
played on we never knew about,
[SPEAKER_04]: and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: A classic must watch for reggae fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Callie High is blessed today to be with
one of reggae's royalty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Richie Daly, who I've known
for a good 45 years, and he is the bass
[SPEAKER_04]: player of Third World.
[SPEAKER_04]: Richie, thanks for joining us,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a pleasure, Vince.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a history that goes back so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to believe we're that old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow I don't feel that old.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, Richie, where did you grow up
and how did you get into music?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I just desired to learn to
play the guitar.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother used to be in that band.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to watch him rehearse and I
say, I got to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I must do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got hooked into it and I was
self-taught.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just scrambling around Kingston,
Jamaica, pick up what I can pick up from
[SPEAKER_03]: other people, you know, and add it to my
knowledge bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some years afterwards, I got joined up
with Third World and started the band with
[SPEAKER_03]: Third World.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's kind of history
playing itself out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And were you from, I saw some interviews,
said you were from the neighborhood of
[SPEAKER_04]: Trench Town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and repeat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you from Trench Town?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, close to it, next door to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I live very close to Trench
Town, a place called Roast Town.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about a hundred yards.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've known you for so long,
but I realized that the first time I ever
[SPEAKER_04]: heard your bass playing was on Johnny Too
Bad by The Slickers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I played guitar in that song.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you played guitar in that song?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a guitar player at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was the organ player?
[SPEAKER_05]: Earl Wiley.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was Bob Marley's organ player.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great organist.
[SPEAKER_04]: You also played with Ken Booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I toured with him, you know,
on and off in the younger Booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's bass or guitar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you still play guitar a little?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I still play guitar in the last
album.
[SPEAKER_03]: I play mostly rhythm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and a few guitar tricks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any other tracks, early tracks
that weren't Third World songs that you
[SPEAKER_04]: played on that we might know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did some Bob Marley thing in the
early days, but this was during Third
[SPEAKER_03]: World time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Punky Reggae Party and Lord I Gotta Keep
On Moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I played bass and those tracks with Bob
Marley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love those tracks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you worked with so many different
producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You worked with Lee Scratch-Perry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You worked with Chris Blackwell,
who actually signed you guys in 75.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you worked with Bob,
was that a self-produced album by Bob?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Scratch-Perry was produced as an
album.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it like?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those guys are all pretty
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, first of all, you got Lee
Scratch-Perry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Chris Blackwell, Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you say Lee Scratch-Perry produced the
Bob Marley tunes?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Marley was more the executive
producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would come and give his opinion at the
end of the session, but not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_03]: produced producer, but his presence made a
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last album you guys made is
produced by Damien Marley.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give us a little insight as to how
all of those different personalities
[SPEAKER_04]: produce?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a similarity between Bob Marley
and Damien Marley.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbeknownst to him, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the studio with Bob Marley back
in the late 70s and early 80s,
[SPEAKER_03]: late 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just his attitude and his whole work
ethic based some similarity to Damien and
[SPEAKER_03]: Damien to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the tendency to say the apple
will fall far from the tree, but it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: true in that case.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they both have amazing work ethics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes out in the music, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you tell us some of the more
memorable moments of recording your last
[SPEAKER_04]: album?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you had a lot of guest artists on
that album.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the collaboration was endless.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Damien picked all of them and thought
they would be more suitable because we
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't work with producers much throughout
the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to work with Damien was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would decide to say, yeah,
you're the younger cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because cats used to drive him to school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, his son and Damien went to the
same school and my son too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My son Lugaman who was with Sean Paul,
Dirty Cup Crew, did the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: All did the same school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the parents get together and
say, hey, you did a pick up this evening
[SPEAKER_03]: and you take who to go to music lesson,
go to music lesson, but you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who writes the songs for Third World?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who?
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally?
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally, all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good group effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody puts in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've always wanted to ask this,
and it might be obvious, but Brand New
[SPEAKER_04]: Beggar was one of my favorite songs and it
always has been.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the meaning here in Brand New
Beggar?
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we're not Brand New Beggars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Brand New Beggar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Brand New Beggar.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, my outlook on life has
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm developing to another
person, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm still in need of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Brand New Beggar, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great concept and it shows a lot of
humility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you there when the guest artists did
their parts on the new album?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them, some of them, the track was
sent to their part of the world at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some great people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got Kronix on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got Taurus Reilly, Tisan Chin,
and Pressure Bus Pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Damian singing on one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are some of your most favorite
reggae bass lines?
[SPEAKER_04]: Concrete Jungle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I must say that you are an amazing
bass player.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope we can collaborate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any current or future projects you guys
working on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, we're just waiting,
getting our shots and everyone is getting
[SPEAKER_03]: vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will move on because we have a
whole year and some has been taken from us
[SPEAKER_03]: in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, knowledge from this and
inspiration still, you know, it's not a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live through this and you haven't
learned anything, shame on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The world should learn something.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole world can learn something here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just, you know, just for the hell
of it, who are the current the current
[SPEAKER_04]: members of Third World?
[SPEAKER_03]: On drums, it's the same Lendworth
Williams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyboards, Norris Webb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar, Steven Catcore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself and Richard Daly bass.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Followed by A.J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brown and lead vocals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mention one of the keyboard
player because he's one of the keyboard
[SPEAKER_03]: player over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's decided that he's going to do a solo
career singing Maurice Krueger,
[SPEAKER_03]: a very brilliant musician.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is his desire to be a solo artist
and wish him all the blessings,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I think he's in Italy right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a pit post.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eating gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I asked him if it was if it was
delicious in Italian.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what do you think reggae means
to the world, Richie?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that sounds like a broad question,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to what it means to the world,
I wouldn't deem to answer that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can only tell you what how it affect
the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the years, you know, when it was
on virtual and when I met you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're probably one of the few white
persons who knew reggae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I turned all my friends on to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, your first album was a big
hit here in the San Fernando Valley,
[SPEAKER_04]: I must say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody I knew had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are, you know, and I watched it
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Radio stations never used to play the
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody very rarely hit the top 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, I watched it grow and
open.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what made it even more popular is
when they start to have more reggae
[SPEAKER_03]: festivals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people just all over the world
carry this reggae festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have that hypnotic thing about it
that brings people out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did my experience in Jamaican reggae
music and Jamaican food.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that much I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it sure brings a lot of positive new
generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your parents learned it,
acquired it, but they are they are from in
[SPEAKER_03]: their infant state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their parents are playing it from their
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiny talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a whole different look for
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's it's been an inspiration to at
least me and the world as far as I can
[SPEAKER_04]: say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And does that do you feel a weight on your
shoulder being one of the world's reggae
[SPEAKER_04]: ambassadors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: A weight is something on your shoulders
means a burden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard to carry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll look at it as a crown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a kind of a question here about
order of distinction.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Jamaica awards these orders of
distinction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have one of these, Richie?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought you should have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, the Honorable Richie Basie.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to just say that Callie High
would like to award you the Callie High
[SPEAKER_04]: Order of Highest Distinction awarded to
Richard Daly.
[SPEAKER_04]: April 3rd, 2021 for being a cool guy,
great bass player and turning the 818
[SPEAKER_04]: Callie and the world onto great music for
more than 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blessed be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is the first Callie High Award
of Highest Distinction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will be sending that off and we can
do a medal ceremony when you come to
[SPEAKER_04]: Callie.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is the time frame for
concerts to open?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we can catch nothing major
for the rest of the year because whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: there is to be, you know, it's in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have to be in place already.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a few things that was contracted some
years ago and the people are still holding
[SPEAKER_03]: us to those agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how this covid thing work out and just
watching it from the ring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, do you plan to do any like virtual
live shows?
[SPEAKER_03]: We might end up doing some and then we
might not because I've seen out of out of
[SPEAKER_03]: a hundred of them, there's only two of
them I might have seen and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: impressive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of them just seem a little
bit too sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hear you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so no audience, no feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, no interruption.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this thing, you know, there's what
Hamon one is very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what were some of the most memorable
shows you played over the years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Open for Bob Marley in nineteen seventy
five at the Lyceum in London.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that's a special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working at Santana on the West Coast,
East Coast upon United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: toured with him for about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Santana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He requested us to be there with him as
his opening band and to the West Coast
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and you know, I remember on our last
interview, you talked about the the show
[SPEAKER_04]: at Heroes Stadium two nights after Bob got
shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, that must have been the this the
show at Heroes Stadium in Jamaica two
[SPEAKER_04]: nights after Bob got shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was he was circuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think was the largest crowd
you ever played for?
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the name of the country,
but it's close to a million people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was in the audience somewhere in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: A million people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A Woodstock in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine hundred and something thousand.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what does that feel like, Richie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've you know, I I I had a band.
[SPEAKER_04]: We played for small crowds and even small
crowds were amazing, but I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, I want to thank you for talking
with us today, Richie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blessed love, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be talking real soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kevin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Cali High.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would like to thank Richie Daly of
Third World for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Richie.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_04]: You too, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love, we laugh, we cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smile, we frown, we sigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe, we know, we're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what they taunt us for how we
were brought up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dream, we hope, we pray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work, we toil, we play.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bleed, we grieve, we fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where we come from, this is my
assumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: People of a different color pray to a
different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a way to get along with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for the children's sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: People of a different color pray to a
different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a way to get along with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the children's sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see, we learn, we teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We search, we earn, we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fear, we hurt, we weep.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what they taunt us for how we
were brought up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow, we find, we feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fall, we bruise, we heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all think our burdens real.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where we come from, this is my
assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: People of a different color pray to a
different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find a way to get along with each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for the children's sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: People of a different color pray to a
different
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
Let's find a way to get along with each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see, I stand free.
[SPEAKER_01]: With unity, we have so many possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got so much love to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a difference aside, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know so we live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack, create the world for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love, earn, and pray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to respect a one for how they miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strictly positive, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People of a different color pray to a
different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a way to get along with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a difference, sing it for the
children's sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: People of a different color pray to a
different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a way to get along with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sing it for the children's sake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a change.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
