[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're talking about something we all
got to do several times a day and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning our banger after a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's Q-tips, things,
heady swabs, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all work really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest downfall that I've found is
when it comes to the necks and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to shove Q-tips up there and they
break off in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dab sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to dab sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came up with an ingenious,
flexible neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to just get it right down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice and flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All deep black, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the dab sponge mini to be able
to get it down into the control towers and
[SPEAKER_01]: slurpers and the other devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what's really cool is the original
dab, or I guess the dab sponge 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits most buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just grab your bucket and it fits
just right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunk it.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They even have this nice, cool little
carrying case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't set it up yet, but it's made out
of silicone, traveling, be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: your marbles in there, all that good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can tell, that was super easy,
super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get much better than that,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad somebody came out with one of
these things because they are a lifesaver,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when it comes to slurpers and
control towers, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: These nets are a bitch, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
Cheers.
