[SPEAKER_00]: So this is greenhouse number two running
hundreds in here so a little smaller pots
[SPEAKER_00]: I direct sowed these seeds so kind of all
over the place some of them Didn't take
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I threw something late So those
ones haven't been sexed yet, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is all the sweet and sour series Over
here So I'm working on this week Got some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Sprayed them yesterday these ones
didn't have any bugs on the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but got some of those light green aphids
coming in on the clover, so I chopped the
[SPEAKER_00]: clover and composted that and then just
did a spray with some Horticultural soap
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks happy But yeah, this is a lot of
the Kundos V over here these are the The
[SPEAKER_00]: sour lemon head this is a mango I Didn't
release this one didn't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of it, but it's the mango by sour
lemon head Everything's looking nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: happy stoked for this one, so I'm gonna
finish cloning this one this week and then
[SPEAKER_00]: hop over to The third greenhouse and start
filling pots By the end of this month,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have all three greenhouses up and
running I was gonna do an outdoor plot But
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of work to do out there
before I can really get things going so
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, all this is recycled soil top
dress with some of the Compost from the
[SPEAKER_00]: dairy farm So we'll die it's a major surf
that I sprinkled on before the nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and get the fungus gnats under
control, but Not really seeing many
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore We'd have somewhat of an
infestation
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more sour lemon head crosses over
here Yeah, these are the S ones which I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't release I don't really like them so
far
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically got that same kind of lemon
diesel profile Good structure not too
[SPEAKER_00]: lanky not super branchy also not super
leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it greenhouse number two lights
are coming on and This will also be done
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah a couple months behind typically
I'd have like an early spring harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: both houses, but I'm just stoked to be
able to Get everything set up in these
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and finally not have to be resetting
greenhouse every time so I think in the
[SPEAKER_00]: long run I'll make up those couple months
that I was down just in transition time
[SPEAKER_00]: Got every you got the last few double
enders out everything's LED Irrigation set
[SPEAKER_00]: up finally been hand watering my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's gonna save me by a couple days a
week Let's see what else we got going on
[SPEAKER_00]: set over the third greenhouse
