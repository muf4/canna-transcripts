[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Cali High episode 33 recorded
on 420 live from Jamaica with Billy Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Wilmot founding member and lead singer of
the Mystic Revealers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy is also the proprietor of Jamnesia
Surf Camp in Bull Bay Jamaica where the
[SPEAKER_03]: newest generation of reggae greats learn
to surf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to Billy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Cali High.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Cali High is blessed to be here with
Billy Mystic Wilmot founder of the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Revealers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Billy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be alive and COVID free,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you tell us our audience a little
bit about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm about coming on up to 62
years old, past 61.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm away to 62 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a musician slash actor slash surfer
slash daddy slash grandpa slash uncle
[SPEAKER_00]: slash brother slash great-granduncle,
all kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think probably my biggest
international claim to fame is as one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the founding members of the group Mystic
Revealers, which is not by any means a
[SPEAKER_00]: very well-known reggae group, but we are
authentic and we are known in the music
[SPEAKER_00]: circle in Jamaica for what we have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few hits over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That transcended the Jamaican marketplace
and exposed us to marketplace in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: and Japan and North America, South and
Central America as well, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group was signed to a number of
recording labels over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've worked with local labels like
Carrion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with One Nest Label,
Jimmy Cliff One Nest Label.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done work internationally with
Atlantic Records and with Mesa,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Ross Records.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a release more recently through
VP Records as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musically, that's basically a little bit
about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I'm the father of five,
married to my wife, Claudette.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been married for about 42 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, five kids, five grandkids,
you know, and blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you always lived in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, all my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born here right here in Bull Bay,
grew up in Bull Bay right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you say that people were
following you, you seem to be fairly well
[SPEAKER_03]: connected in the reggae scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just wondering how come I never
heard of you, but I've been listening to
[SPEAKER_03]: your tunes lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really loving them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get into the music a little
more, I just was very fascinated that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a surf school there on the beach
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right here, right here at Jamnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have a surf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been surfing since the 60s,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surfing, I've been a surfer for way
longer than I was a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we didn't get the band together
until about 1978.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the band together, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for at least 10 years prior to that,
I was surfing here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surfing was a part of who I was,
you know, growing on the beach here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sea is rough here in Bull Bay most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we learned to swim and catch the waves,
which we didn't know was surfing at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we hadn't been exposed to surfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we didn't know anything about
Hawaii and California and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just knew our little local knowledge in
the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew if you swam with a wave and
you swam fast enough, it would pick you up
[SPEAKER_00]: and take you along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got little pieces of wood that we
could hang onto and swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to call them belly boards,
lie down on our belly and come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got into surfing from that time,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the years, based on the journey
we've been through, my wife has always
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to have some kind of tourism
offering, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she was more thinking of like a place
up in the mountains, a kind of holistic
[SPEAKER_00]: life sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we weren't financially well
off enough to occupy and maintain two
[SPEAKER_00]: different properties on opposite end of
the island or opposite sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: island, we had to narrow down our vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea during my touring around,
when the band started to tour,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a chance to go to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were touring the west coast of the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had been surfing all my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by this time, I was like about 30
years old, 32 years old with kids and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally getting to go to California and
traveled up and down there and saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: surfing environment, saw the surfing vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, wow, people up here would really
appreciate what we have in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my mind, by that time,
I had been exposed to surfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I had gotten magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: VHS cassettes of surfing were available on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a surfer, I'd buy them and take
them home to show the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of saw the waves that were
being pursued internationally and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're under the misconception that
this is how the waves were always in these
[SPEAKER_00]: other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't realize that, wow, the images we
are getting from these world-renowned surf
[SPEAKER_00]: locations were just images of the best
days of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew up thinking it was like that every
single day of the year in Hawaii or
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we found out that that's not the
case, and it came down to sort of reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: we realized we had really a wonderful
setup in Jamaica with 300 days of surf a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no crowds, lots of different spots
with high quality surf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought and said, wow, maybe if we open
a little surf camp, I'm sure we could find
[SPEAKER_00]: enough people to fill our few little rooms
that we could create and our little space
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could put some tents and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would come and tie up a hammock for
$10 a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would supplement our income.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we established a surf camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grew from just being a little place
of our own to world-renowned Jamnesia that
[SPEAKER_00]: people from all over the world come here
for surfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music, skating, and Rastafari reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're outside of Kingston, you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are close to the airport in
Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you land at the airport in Kingston,
at Norman Manley International Airport in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingston, we're just about 15 minutes from
the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy drive out to the camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have airport shuttle that can meet you
and bring you out to the camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tiny little rooms with some beds
in it, a little cupboard space,
[SPEAKER_00]: shared bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have for meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a feel good, like somewhere
to be in Jamaica where you're not at the
[SPEAKER_00]: all-inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in the tourist trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in real Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take the downtown to the recording
studios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to go to the Bob Marley
Museum, you can jump on a local bus and go
[SPEAKER_00]: there like how normal people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really nice, immersive
experience to the whole Jamnesia thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope to get there, and I'd love to be
staying there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to come on down, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were saying that we talked
yesterday a little bit, and you said that
[SPEAKER_03]: the big waves come during the winter or
when the hurricanes are happening,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's the summer season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From June to the beginning of October,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how gnarly is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it can be super gnarly, super duper
gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, life and death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your life is on the line when you're out
there gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waves the size of two to three story
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all on YouTube and the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search for if you just do a Google
search for surfing in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find us because we're like the main
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't miss us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of videos and photos and
stuff up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people don't believe I was just
the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some famous surfing guys called
the Godoskas brothers from California,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Encinitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they they they were they
came down here and were surfing with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last hurricane season,
we sent back some video for them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were telling us, man, this looks like
Sunset Beach, Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's exactly like Sunset Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we took it from them that that's
a good comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to check it out someday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what instruments do you play,
Mystic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to claim to be an
instrumentalist, but I I am the I'm mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: a singer songwriter and I use a guitar to
do my songwriting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not a guitar virtuoso.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do play with the band and most of the
time when we're recording, the rhythm
[SPEAKER_00]: guitar is usually me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll add a few little phrases
here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do play bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bass is probably my favorite
instrument, even though I'm not the bass
[SPEAKER_00]: player.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I do a lot of percussion
work as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like the percussion on your
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I would not I would never
knowing the musicians that I do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae industry and their caliber of
talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never be so forward as to present
myself as a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I much rather say I'm a singer songwriter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who are your musical influences?
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed you have quite a like a range of
of types of songs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystic Revealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were one of the reasons why many people
didn't know about us is because we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to put into a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not you can't just say
we're roots or we're dancehall or we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dub or we're you know, we are musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm a songwriter who writes
emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of how do I feel in the
momentous, you know, growing up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica, you're exposed to international
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I grew up, there was just
two radio stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was RJR and JBC and it was AM
frequency, very poor quality sound and
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that were played on
Jamaican radio was recordings that were
[SPEAKER_00]: the best quality possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the music you heard on the
radios in Jamaica was hit parade music
[SPEAKER_00]: from North America or Britain,
you know, and some productions because
[SPEAKER_00]: there was one or two major recording
studios back in the 60s that had the
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity to produce music at the level
that when the record was produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could actually put it on the turntable
and play it on an AM frequency and send it
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and you could actually hear what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of early Jamaican music was iconic
music was recorded in very low quality
[SPEAKER_00]: recording studios, you know, two track and
four track and eight track and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that music was was not able to be
presented on the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those days, they would call that music
dancehall music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just meant that music that was not
really fit for airplay and not fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: airplay because of lyrics or content,
but just due to quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those music would be played on sound
systems in the dancehall because the
[SPEAKER_00]: dancehall, the sound system is the signal
path for a sound system is way different
[SPEAKER_00]: than a radio station.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radio station just takes a signal from
the needle, puts it through an amplifier
[SPEAKER_00]: and send it out in a mono signal out over
the airwaves with a tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either tone it high or low or in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early recording, the early sound
systems had a crossover system where they
[SPEAKER_00]: took that signal from the needle on the
turntable and they put it into a four band
[SPEAKER_00]: splitter that would select the frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say, OK, we select the bottom
end, all those frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equalizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them through, not even through an
equalizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could set the parameters of the audio
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had bass coming out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go to an amplifier of its own and
be connected to the bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they would have low mid frequency
coming out of out of another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go to amplification, equalization
and go to the low mid speaker cabinets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the high mid that would go
same procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a four band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had four bands of separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the record was being played,
you had more audio control in the sound
[SPEAKER_00]: system than you did on radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radio basically just had to be good on the
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't, it wouldn't sound good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sound systems, they could put this
record on that was made in some tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the low mids needed boosting,
they could boost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bottom end needed boosting or the
high ends or the high mid, the vocals was
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit low, they could turn up the high
mids and not affect the bottom end
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that four band crossover that they
implemented, it allowed the music to be
[SPEAKER_00]: played and heard on a much higher quality
than it could possibly be heard on the
[SPEAKER_00]: radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So living in Bull Bay, Bull Bay is an area
where I grew up now, where it's a sound
[SPEAKER_00]: system place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Lico Cooper, Island in the Sun,
Arambee Theater, Paradise Cove.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these places back in the day
where sound system would come to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Ruby would come up from country and
Kilimanjaro and all of the sound system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the top sound system like in the
70s, the Socialist Roots and Stergov and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them type of sound system always
used to play in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those early times, I was exposed to
this type of music, music that was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: radio because the quality, and that meant
it would be coming from abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be hearing all of the local
stuff that was being played by the sound
[SPEAKER_00]: system that you would not hear on the
radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a very wide listening scope that
affected me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was going to narrow down now and
say, who were some of the people whose
[SPEAKER_00]: music affected me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love listening to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love listening to Freddie
McGregor, Dennis Brown, Alton Ellis,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gregory Isaacs, Hugh Mundell, some of the
younger ones in that time also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uday Iskender, Israel Vibration,
these are the groups that I would listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the music that was being played
by Jalov music, a lot of the 12 tribes of
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel artists that were on the Orthodox
label.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny you would say that because
yesterday somebody was telling me about
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel Vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Israel Vibration and a lot of other
acts that came out through that musical
[SPEAKER_00]: outlet, the 12 tribes of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the music body of the 12 tribes of
Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those acts, Dennis Brown,
Freddie McGregor, these artists come out
[SPEAKER_00]: through there, through the 12 tribes of
Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these artists were musicians and
artists that we were exposed to and
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of international, of course it
was all the R&B artists influence us,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those R&B groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of reggae, we used to love,
we loved when Steel Pulse came on the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene and Aswad, that was very interesting
for me because Steel Pulse didn't sound
[SPEAKER_00]: like a band who was trying to sound
authentically Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aswad was a band that was in England,
but was probably the most authentic
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican sound band at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we hired Steel Pulse because the thing
was different and it did have an
[SPEAKER_00]: international flavor to it that made it
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my granddaughter coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we say hi?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!
[SPEAKER_00]: She's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know, Aswad and Steel Pulse
were two of the international bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Africans like Lucky Dube as
well, Fela Kute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a sophisticated listening ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I couldn't leave out Third
World, our own Third World, and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Marley and the Wheelers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a lot of influences musically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you listen to our catalogue,
you'll see that our music does cover a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide range of genre fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, well, that's why I asked that
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some Motown influence in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some roots reggae.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw various eclectic mixes of,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask you, who are the members of the
Mystic Revealers beside yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now, the remaining members of
the office, myself, Leroy Edwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lion and Bass, and Nicholas Henry,
or Nicky Cymbal and Drums, are the three
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining foundation members of the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we were recording our latest
album, I did go out and try to get some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other musicians who had played with
the group over the years because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, since about 1988 or so,
the three of us have been members of the
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the group, as I said,
started in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like we had been through a few
drummers previously and a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different keyboardists and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by 88, it was myself and Lion who had
founded the group in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Drummy came on board about 88 or
so, 87.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it's been the three of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a large number of people
who have come on board and changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, different lead guitarists come
on, different harmony singers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the players seem to be really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, you released Jaja People.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that your first album in like 23
years?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you did some singles in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we did a number of singles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think VP had put out a compilation
of hits from our catalog also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first album in about 23,
24 years, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a great album.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I recommend it to my listeners
wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who is singing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have Herb Must Legalize Now was
released in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got Kronix and you have Kabaka
Pyramid on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like a big party at that
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, Jamnesia is a seedbed for
raw young talent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really why all those artists are
a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those artists are artists that
have some historical connection with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this new reggae revival movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all sprung out of the Jamnesia,
the reality of the Jamnesia experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was easy getting all those guys on
board, you know, all personal friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was on their personal friends of
ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a great tune, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have one little question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, yo, keep it down for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: On your 1997 song Warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's the girl singing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chachi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chachi Terasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an Ethiopian girl who was in the
island at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were at Carry On Records over in
Centon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in the studio and we were all
hanging out there and we got together and
[SPEAKER_00]: did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love that song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where did you record Jaja People?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jaja People, we started,
you know, we hadn't done anything for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long and had still been writing songs and
had this huge backup of songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even now I have at least another album or
two worth of songs that have been written
[SPEAKER_00]: in this space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to put something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, I decided that been so
long, the band had been inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were doing a few little shows
here and there and rehearsing just to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: keep our fingers up to speed, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, you know, I want to put out an
album.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put out an album.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do one thing more, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started on it and then so it started
because I know a lot of people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and over the years we've gained a
certain amount of respect in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a position where I could
basically call on members of the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: music fraternity to come and be a part of
what I was doing, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I started doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded about four songs and had a lot
of other work, a lot of other preparatory
[SPEAKER_00]: work and demo work being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But about two years ago, we had a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My house burned to the ground and we lost
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost a lot of, a lot of Mystic
Revealers, memorabilia, all of our photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like our very first test press of
our very first release, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to hear that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my posters from the tours and
international tours over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I'd collected around the group,
all the cassettes, all the CDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the DVDs, all the live video of us
performing internationally, everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: in storage at the house and it all went up
in smoke, you know, and a lot of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'd been working on at the time also,
we lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up saying, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look up, I say, how can I, I said,
you know, nowadays people making music can
[SPEAKER_00]: stop finding phone, you know, I must be
able to just make some music here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I had Garage Band on a tablet
and I made a few tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a few tracks on the Garage Band and
say, you know, I think I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's on Garage Band, I'll put it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to get this music out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've made a few demos on Garage Band
and I was listening to it and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if this technology is available
on this like a tablet, I'm sure there must
[SPEAKER_00]: be some available technology that's maybe
on a production level, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did some research and I found out
that yeah, you can do stuff and I can,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got access to a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody suggested a program to me,
a sound editing program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I downloaded it to my laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went out and I invested about a
Behringer 18 XR 18, which I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to anybody interested in
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me an 18 input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ability, so I could actually record.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could set up the whole band and record
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had enough input into the thing as USB
connection to the laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that basically gave me a studio right
on my veranda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the tracks I think about of
the 12 tracks, I think probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or nine of them were recorded on my
veranda here in Bull Bay, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And voice right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you had access to the original
tracks, I could solo vocal tracks and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could hear my grandkids running around in
the background, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's a very natural song we
use, but I mean, everybody who asked me,
[SPEAKER_00]: where did you record this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell nobody believed that it was on
the veranda because the audio quality
[SPEAKER_00]: still tends to make you think it was
recorded inside a control studio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was in one of the studios in
Jamaica and you have horns on there that
[SPEAKER_03]: sound amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use a lot of horns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm for live horns and always been for
live horns.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we used to tour, I used to be very
upset because the record company,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would mean three more tickets and we
were already a huge aggregation and stage
[SPEAKER_00]: were like eight, nine people on stage plus
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we went on tour, it was a big
undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to ask for horns as well from the
record company was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need a bus that sleeps 16 people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it was, so I ended up
touring a lot without horns, but I always
[SPEAKER_00]: loved horns, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when I was at this situation,
here we are in COVID, we're all locked
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can call Dean if I want Dean to come put
on a horn for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know we know all of the people
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's stuck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's on tour, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just access a lot of the people who I
had worked with in the past, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: got keyboardists, but we come in and lay a
few boards for me, you know, and Bridget
[SPEAKER_00]: and Isaacs put on horns for me and Sting
Ray, they put on horns for me and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they sound great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinna Smith, Chinna Smith, they helped me
also, you know, Chinna did some production
[SPEAKER_00]: with me on one of the songs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that at Chinna's place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the songs that wasn't done
on my veranda, but was done on his
[SPEAKER_00]: veranda, you know, in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was a very, very,
it was a very entertaining experience for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, you know, to make this album.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the first album I've had so much
say over the finished product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, before we are some young group
and you're assigned to Atlantic Records
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will just say, hey, why don't you
work with Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked with so and so and so and so and
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be good to have him on the album.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he comes in and you give him your song
and he says, why don't you put a bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: A bridge would really be nice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, you could go to, from that you
could go to a D minor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next thing you know, him off
co-writing on your album and the song
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sound like what it sounded to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because this record company is
spending 50 or $60,000 on your production,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't just say, fuck you, because you
don't have a million selling record,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, under your belt where you can
dictate to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're promising to make a star out of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so this new album, I didn't have
to deal with any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have recording studio costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to book studio time ahead
and be out of there because the next group
[SPEAKER_00]: is outside waiting and we're already one
hour past our checkout time and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in and record, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just wake up at three in the
morning and go out on the verandah and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, I'm going to try those harmonies
again tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gave me such amount of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I was the main mixing engineer
as well, you know, me and my son Einlek,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we did most of the production
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really, you know, relaxing and
very low stress environment to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it has a really great vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very happy with the finished product,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really like Blue Nile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a lot of the songs, but Blue Nile
somehow just hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was recorded at Grafton.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the songs that was
recorded at Grafton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikey Bennett's studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great friend of mine, collaborated over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's worked on a number of my recordings
over the years, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked on that one together at Grafton
studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horns weren't done there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did horns elsewhere, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things recorded one place,
mixed at a place and finalized on my
[SPEAKER_00]: verandah, you know, some of the songs that
ended up getting mixed on the verandah
[SPEAKER_00]: that were recorded in some of the other
studios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting airplay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting airplay, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, we're getting airplay,
but Jamaica is so technically up to date
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a program that you can buy,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some sort of service,
you know, they have a promotional thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and it includes X amount of plays per week
and X amount of radio stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it costs two thousand U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars for the first month and then
whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and when you pay them,
then all of a sudden your music starts
[SPEAKER_00]: playing mysteriously on a lot of radio
stations, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have that kind of budget
behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I say, I made this music for special
people who would go out and discover it
[SPEAKER_00]: and have it like a like a very precious
thing that's not readily available,
[SPEAKER_00]: something you've never heard about and
wonder why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is the avenue we're going
down with our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping that maybe because we
don't have that type of support in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of promotional support around it,
we're more going for maybe a long term,
[SPEAKER_00]: gradual snowball effect because the songs
being the fact that they are not tied to
[SPEAKER_00]: any production sound, traditional sound
like it's not trucked back or it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's not a producer's song.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our song which is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever if you hear it this year or
next year or the year after, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be so easy for you to timestamp
it because it's on some rhythms that were
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're timestamping 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping that we'll have a kind of
longer lifespan and a chance to snowball
[SPEAKER_00]: and gather fans and listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it would be a great big hit
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I took a trip to Hawaii and,
you know, turned on the radio stations and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all freaking playing reggae,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, some of the rhythm sections
almost sound like they were recorded
[SPEAKER_03]: together a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all live, it's all live recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't use any loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only song that was used with a drum
machine and looping was Kiss For Me which
[SPEAKER_00]: we did with Natural Eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted something on the album Young and
feeling like what was going on locally at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time we did the album so that that
would be able to timestamp the album for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that collaboration with what the
Young Masters who were on the cutting edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of producing this kind of trap type sound
thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the trap thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave them that and they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apart from that, everything else is
live recording, live drum and bass,
[SPEAKER_00]: drum and country off and roll off and we
lick the rhythm and if it's not steady,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're not on the studio time,
pressure, we were able to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that take, let's go again,
let's go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not today, let's try it again
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, weekend, we try it on the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had time to do that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the album is a lot of one take.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vocals are one take vocals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the vocals were the guide voice
that was laid at the time when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: laying the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of places maybe we would have to
punch in a few little fat spots but we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried not to interfere with the production
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of spots, my son was concerned about
my voice going flat at certain points and
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him, no, I want to keep that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want something that we go back and
punch that in and punch me in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: punch me in there and punch me in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's slightly flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit late going into this
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to feel real live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the album, it was as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That concern why the album has the feel
that it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a great Iri vibe, if I understand
Iri.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you play reggae festivals or are you
planning to after things open up after
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, left to what this COVID
thing is coming with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have a problem with pushing a
Q-tip one foot up my nostril.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't manage the COVID test where
they push that thing way up your nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: all up to your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a brain test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see, do you have any brain up
there?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain on the top of your skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't handle that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they try to push something up my
nose and I just grab it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a natural reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not like a swab, in the mouth or
something like that, I don't think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be traveling anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are the vaccine distributions in
Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're vaccinating people out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People lining up for it, but not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I mean, I'm too old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lived so long that, you know,
I don't want to take up too much space for
[SPEAKER_00]: too long on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking about the place being
overpopulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to live to be too old and
become a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that will protect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that none of us were born into
this world to live forever and we all got
[SPEAKER_00]: to come somehow and go somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to be as happy about my time
here as possible and enjoy it as much as I
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of staying away from the COVID
thing and the vaccines and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't see it around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe if it gets a lot more
serious and people actually are dying,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know and I see sick people around
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day I hear about somebody else
from my community who has gone to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital and may not return, but I don't
have any proof of any of that from where I
[SPEAKER_00]: am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear it on the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's all these people, but you
know, I don't, I'm not experiencing in my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my community of Bull Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funnily enough, Bull Bay was ground
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, the first case that was
identified in Jamaica was identified just
[SPEAKER_00]: about a mile down the road from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, I, I, I don't really know
anybody who has died or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people who have had it,
you know, who have been tested positive
[SPEAKER_00]: and were isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I spoke to them, they said,
well, if nobody had told them it was
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID, they would have just thought it was
just an ordinary flu because one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms were any different than a normal
flu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, well, stay blessed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not saying it's not
dangerous and people shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that me personally,
I put my, my faith in the most high,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and if COVID was lined up to
take me out, I don't think a vaccine is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to stop it from getting
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think if you're out there surfing,
your, your endorphins are going to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: you immune probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so let's talk herb for a minute
since it is 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessed 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless up.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have you been partaking of the
sacred herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first, I mean, of course,
as little tiny kids, we would find Jamaica
[SPEAKER_00]: is everybody smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when there are little kids,
I figure that maybe in North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: the equivalent would be a bit of finding
somebody's cigarette butt and lighting it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and taking a pull on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically how we really started
as kids, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much weed being smoked all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're lucky enough to find like
a joint that somebody lit and it went out
[SPEAKER_00]: and it fell or lost and you end up finding
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from when we were very young,
we got into that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say before I was 10 or 11 years
old, we had already lit up and pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: something and coughed and that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of actually getting access to
weed for myself and partaking and saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that I smoke weed and being able to
declare that I was probably about 14 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old, 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've been smoking since I was 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how has the herb in Jamaica changed
over the years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, well, in the beginning,
you used to smoke a lot of seed bush,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would all had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in those days at Chalice,
we used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know how to make a joint when I
was smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't one you found, we were
smoking at Chalice, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not very high quality weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a connoisseur thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was much more like smoking a cigarette
as opposed to doing drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole experience of marijuana in
Jamaica was a much more casual leisurely
[SPEAKER_00]: undertaking as opposed to like,
let's go down in the basement and get
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that kind of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Jamaica, when you said drug,
nobody thought marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought LSD, cocaine, PCP,
some kind of manufactured thing was what
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marijuana wasn't even included as a
drug in our mindset because grandpa smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: grandma smoke, uncle Jerry smoke,
my father smoke, my cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody exposed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't like people were having to
hide, as I say, in the basement to go get
[SPEAKER_00]: a talk, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Brown was a policeman, live across the
road, and he smoked too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was smoking uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm at home, his son smokes and
he doesn't lock up his son, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a much more socially acceptable
pursuit in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never really had that kind of
connoisseur type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wow, we got to go hide and get high
as quickly as we can and then get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there before the cops find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays with the new herb thing and
high times magazine and all of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen a lot more of those designer
marijuana nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot more people are smoking
marijuana nowadays and used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you find that most of the new users of
marijuana are very much into the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and the high grade type of thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ancient elders obviously love good
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not out there to get this thing that
you take one full and you got to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me ask two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question about one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know about the lamb's bread
technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really a herb planter,
you know, but I know that lamb's bread in
[SPEAKER_00]: those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was like, you know, when you see
it, we have a lot of crystals on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those days, when I was talking about
the late 60s, early 70s, when people tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you about lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said lamb's bread, but really what it
was coming from was lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: The breath of the lamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you put your mouth over on a
glass and you see the breath show those
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals, you know, on the herb,
on the hair of the herb and you see those
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals, it was like condensation of the
lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that was one of the assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a lot of things,
but lamb's bread was for us was just it
[SPEAKER_00]: just meant very high quality weed to most
of the lay people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I say, I wasn't a herb farmer,
you know, so I wouldn't know what were the
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures that would categorize one weed
as lamb's bread and the other one as
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, we know that sentiment
is no seed, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1975, I came to Jamaica and I went to
Negril and I met a Rastafarian named
[SPEAKER_03]: Reeford Ward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he took me up to his grow and he told
me that lamb's bread or breath was when
[SPEAKER_03]: you would cut the top just after it
started budding, you cut the top eight
[SPEAKER_03]: inches off, put it back in the ground and
it re-roots like a clone.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would not tell you that you're
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't educate me as much
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if I was right now,
I just, I just go get weed and smoke weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and my brethren bring a bag of weed and
we'll we'll sew it up and we'll smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: at the chalice and we'll give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a tremendous amount of
seeds, we would cut up the weed and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the board and set it at an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I had seeds too, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every bud had seeds when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Mexican, we had Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get Jamaican on the West coast,
but yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it on the East coast,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've heard about a legendary strain
called the cotton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what happened to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I stopped getting really
into all the different varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: strains of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 or 15 years ago, I was exposed to
a tremendous amount of insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I inhaled a lot of insecticide in a room
and almost died from insecticide
[SPEAKER_00]: poisoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, I can't smell or taste
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they bring the weed to me and say,
how does this smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I just smoke weed like
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have a spliff in my mouth or I
always overload the chalice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more like a habit to me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm constantly on a certain level
mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to go and pursue to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm high 99% of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, listen, I want to thank you for this
interview and it's been really nice
[SPEAKER_03]: talking to you and I hope to get to your
Jamnesia surf camp there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you check out Jamnesia surf IG,
every Sunday we have a live stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We represent various artists who more than
likely you've never heard of as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but like, as I say, out of the
Jamnesia experience came artists that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a reggae aficionado, you will know
because Kronix is a product of Jamnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proto J is a product of Jamnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: John 9, Raging Fire, Nomads, Kabaka
Pyramid, Chesty Royal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all of these iconic artists right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get the opportunity to interview
them, ask them about their Jamnesia
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and if they have one,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to get to interview
Kronix and Proto J and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping that Proto J's mom might help
out on that end.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Lorna Bennett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lorna.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first day Proto J went on a stage in
his life, it was right here at my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: His mother was sitting right there and
everybody said, go, go on the stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't want to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time he went on the stage in
his life was at Jamnesia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this last year of COVID lockdown,
I have derived countless hours of pleasure
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to both those guys, you know,
and everybody else too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really like the new third world album.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I've got your album, the new
album.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm stoked over here in Cali.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll do something in the future
and check back in with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I call you on, can we do a live IG
later maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: How late do you stay up out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I go to bed around 1.30 in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll call you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you learn how to roll a reefer or a
sleeve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to college, I had to learn.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chalice was too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Jamaica School of
Agriculture here in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time, I never needed to roll a
sleeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just because I was studying at
night and it was too much work to set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: chalice while studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up having to roll a sleeve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you some special tips when I
meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good now though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a few years since then,
since college years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had 20 or 30 years of practice
rolling a sleeve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother taught me when I was like 12
and he was the best roller I ever saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son, I'll put you up against my son
because right now my son, when you meet
[SPEAKER_00]: them, they look like they came out of some
machine or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Challenge accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to get to Gemnesia.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you fly into Jamaica with some herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: People have, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't think the immigration and
customs here are expecting that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Billy Mystic, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, this is Cali High out and I'll
talk to you later.
