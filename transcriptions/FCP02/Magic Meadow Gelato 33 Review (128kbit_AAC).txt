[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, this is Otis aka OG
is my oxygen yo, it's packs in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: here and We are coming at you with another
Nothing for sale strain review today
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically talking about Magic Meadow
Farms gelato 33 We're super excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were gifted it at the Emerald Cup a few
weekends ago It smells really incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the chance to smoke it a few
times now We believe that this is outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: though G here will tell you a little bit
more about the really interesting grow
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions that led to this product But
this is some serious serious gelato So we
[SPEAKER_00]: were told by the growers at Magic Meadow
Farms that this was grown from the ashes
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Northern California wildfires from
a very fertile land in theory probably
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe with nutrients so they were able to
turn a very tragic thing into a very
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial and positive thing for their
farm and rise up from the ashes with This
[SPEAKER_00]: crop and other crops and end up actually
competing in the Emerald Cup with this and
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing that Magic Meadow Emphasized
during our conversations was the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of land restoration Really
their focus is around growing phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: product as well as contributing to the
soil health and and the regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: Practices in their area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we are always really excited
when Sort of the product that we consume
[SPEAKER_01]: can align to our larger values and this
certainly meets that criteria Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we we feel really good supporting
grassroots organic farmers Ultimately,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where people can build community
and educate other growers and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: can support each other Speaking of
Northern, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that gelato in a lot of ways Is a
pretty classic Northern California strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 33 Fina, which is one of the
the more common I know that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited about all of them now the
the 41 and the 45 are really popular but
[SPEAKER_01]: also at this point people are excited
about the jello the guava and And so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nice to have someone bringing it back to
what I sort of considered to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: classic the 33 It's it's earthy and sweet
and I think best described like you said
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier as being very reminiscent of
sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a cooling quality To it that's
really pleasant and I'm sort of excited to
[SPEAKER_01]: spark this up and see see how the 33
flavor Translates with Magic Meadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I said and like Pax said the
oh, thank you Pax.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just passed me this Doink that we just
rolled up right here So like Pax and I
[SPEAKER_00]: were saying the Sunset Sherbert flavor is
really pronounced in this cut of gelato 33
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it's a very very sweet earthy
delicious smoke and in both a vaporizer or
[SPEAKER_00]: a Joint like this Doink that we rolled up
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It Absolutely shines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The couple times we smoke this it actually
reminds me of jealousy Which is a strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that people are really excited about right
now Which is just backgrowing the gelato
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the Sunset Sherbert but I do think as
we've gone ahead and smelled and had dry
[SPEAKER_01]: puffs of this joint to this point that the
sherb is really coming out and I'm stoked
[SPEAKER_00]: to Spark it Yeah, I'm super stoked as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This joint looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fatty for sure and Really excited
for those delicious kind of sweet earthy
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost like kind of like fermented fruity,
but still like very delicious like jam
[SPEAKER_00]: like flavors to come through from that
sherbert so we are gonna be smoking this
[SPEAKER_00]: today in both a vaporizer and a joint It
tastes really good in both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects come through strongly in both
of them Overall, it's a very stony smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoo Hell yeah Smoking great already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Can already smell that gelato sweetness
coming off the joint totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I said There is a lot of sherb
in it, but you do get those deserty
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors as well that are very reminiscent
of gelato I Haven't even hit it yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can tell there's a creaminess to the
smoke definitely and in this kind of joint
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just absolutely like such a
flavor rush on your palate the smoke I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna even out our burn here on the joint
real quick Gotta make sure to taste some
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly as many know you got to waste it
to taste it whether you're smoking dabs or
[SPEAKER_00]: lighten up the end of that joint
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely getting closer to a nice
even burn So I'm about to pass this joint
[SPEAKER_00]: to packs, but I want one more hit first Or
maybe two That's looking real nice Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's delicious here take this man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to hit this hold this
up beautifully Smoking good There is more
[SPEAKER_01]: of an earthiness in this outdoor
expression of Gelato 33 then a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor expressions that I've had the
pleasure of trying and I think that this
[SPEAKER_01]: highlights how epigenetic Factors can
really contribute to to the flavor and the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency of of flour this this does have
More of a toasty almost kind of toasted
[SPEAKER_01]: rice thing going on in addition to that
super sweet creamy It's almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: toasted rice milk tea if you've ever had
that from Aboba spot, which is do you get
[SPEAKER_00]: that toasted rice milk tea is a great
comparison?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just feeling that on my palate is making
me actually want to drink one right now We
[SPEAKER_01]: might have to get one of those later
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely a good Yeah,
good representation that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels turkey on my throat That's one
thing that I enjoy with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor varieties that we've been trying
definitely you do get that it almost feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like the The mono turp thing when you hit
some truly fresh press right off the right
[SPEAKER_01]: off the press where it's I don't want to
say caustic, but it's it's a volatile
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that you feel in your throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to make it sound negative at
all No, it's a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely tickles your palate and
tickles your taste buds tickles your nasal
[SPEAKER_00]: cavities It's from the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're about to do the smell test
Pax has got the jar right now and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna give you his thoughts It definitely
does smell like a sherby gelato There is
[SPEAKER_01]: that that cooling thing going on but to me
It kind of smells like a bread and butter
[SPEAKER_01]: pickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting most I'm excited to get a
sniff, but when I smelled it before the
[SPEAKER_00]: video it definitely was reminiscent of
those flavors Let me bust this open All
[SPEAKER_00]: right guys cracking the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Get the sweetness from the bread and
butter pickle I get candy sweetness funny
[SPEAKER_00]: enough almost similar to like a lifesaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like a red or a pineapple lifesaver
I definitely feel that that that is very
[SPEAKER_00]: much there and definitely the earthiness
and Definitely the fruitiness from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sherbet sunset sherbet, I believe Overall,
it smells great so I filled the da Vinci
[SPEAKER_00]: IQC with some of this gelato 33 from Magic
Meadow Farms I Rock it at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature for the max vapor Basically,
I'm gonna let it heat up and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: hit it and we will tell you our impression
based on the vapor All right now we are up
[SPEAKER_00]: to temp on this thing so let's take a hit
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good, it's really good
actually The flavor from the sherbet is so
[SPEAKER_00]: good in the vaporizer Because you're just
getting those resin glands vaporized on
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower Versus burning all the material
Classic just vaporizer stuff I'm excited
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good though the The lifesaver sherby
flavor really comes through in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer and it does in the joint too But
I think it's definitely more prominent in
[SPEAKER_01]: the vaporizer Yeah, it actually this vapes
incredibly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would be my preferred medium for
yeah for hitting this and I think that for
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor it we should definitely start
using the vaporizer every time because it
[SPEAKER_01]: vapes as Well as a lot of the really sherb
heavy like RS 11 strains that people love
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you can get this from the earth
in the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it as well Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's actually it's very very
enjoyable Wow, I would recommend vaping
[SPEAKER_01]: this all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely recommend vaping this
it's really good
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see there's like definitely
like some vapor from it That is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: better vaping buds I've ever encountered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been very pleasantly Pleasantly
rewarded when I put this in the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't want to say surprise because I
know it's good bud and on my Wild for
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling like it hit me much more quickly
out of the da Vinci.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think You're getting a much more pure
expression of those cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and flavonoids and the various
compounds that cause the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just straight to the dome from
the vaporizer compared to in the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any data or proof about that,
but it just Smokes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna pass the joint back to you and
hold on to the vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haha for sure Yeah, this joints looking
good smoking good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice white ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh My goodness, but we did probably put
Around two grams in that joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably about two grams and we
probably put around point one five grams
[SPEAKER_01]: in a little paperizer and to be totally
honest, I'm enjoying the the vape
[SPEAKER_00]: Significantly more the vaporizer hits
really nice with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the resin is expertly crafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure and You know props to the
farmers for doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously Wow, this is a I want to show
you guys if I can get this to focus nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely leaking resin That's like a at
least a half inch resin ring as With all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the outdoor that we've gotten as a part
of this reviewing cycle I'm super
[SPEAKER_01]: impressed.

running some really cool like 11 week
[SPEAKER_01]: really long flowering hazes.
