[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Kelly High Episode 64,
Soi Cowboy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fourth in a new series called
A Work in Progress, A Retrospective of
[SPEAKER_01]: Adventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I join the Navy,
get stationed at Naval Air Station Point
[SPEAKER_01]: Mugu, and decide to put a band together
with the help of some friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode ends in a recording of the
first performance of the band,
[SPEAKER_01]: Soi Cowboy, live on Tom Schnabel's Morning
Becomes Eclectic at KCRW.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prologue During my travels in Thailand
from 1981 to 1983, I fell in love with
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai culture and Thai music.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point I realized the sound of the
female Thai voice had a captivating
[SPEAKER_01]: quality about it, not only in song but
even in speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something about the way Thai women
emphasized tones differently than Thai
[SPEAKER_01]: men, which made their voices musical.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1985 I joined the Navy when I needed a
job and the Colombian weed business had
[SPEAKER_01]: dried up.
[SPEAKER_01]: By 1987 I was working as an avionics
technician on four H-46 C-9 helicopters at
[SPEAKER_01]: the search and rescue division of the
Naval Air Station Point Mugu, known as
[SPEAKER_01]: Sar-Hilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: This story takes place while I was in the
Navy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring 1987 I was jogging around the
half-mile track at Naval Air Station Point
[SPEAKER_01]: Mugu, looking at the radar towers on the
hill, and thinking what a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a clear spring day and the sky was
azure blue with fluffy white cotton ball
[SPEAKER_01]: clouds dotting the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: The night before I had been talking about
my idea for a band with my good friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Kenny Miller.
[SPEAKER_01]: The band would have Thai female background
singers and it would be a blend of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures, a yin-yang band with American
guys and Thai girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were thinking of what to call the band.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both laughed as Kenny threw out the
name Soy Cowboy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pun on the name of a side street
off of Sukhumvit Road in Bangkok that
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to have a bunch of go-go bars on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: F-14s were using afterburners to launch
themselves skyward and one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: helicopters was landing back in front of
the Sar-Hilo hangar.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few more laps around the track and I
remembered hearing a jazz version of
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny Mercer's Old Cow Hand from the Rio
Grande on Tom Schnabel's Morning Becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: Eclectic on KCRW.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew the song from the Dan Hicks and His
Hot Legs album, Striking It Rich,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it hit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old Cow Hand from the Rio Grande would be
Soy Cowboy's first song.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vision popped into my head fully
formed and somehow I knew it would come to
[SPEAKER_01]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back at the barracks I showered,
put my work uniform on and drove over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sar hangar and removed and replaced an
IFF box on Bloodhound 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloodhound was the call sign for our Sar
helicopters.
[SPEAKER_01]: After filling out the maintenance action
form I got Senior Chief Don O'Shaleen to
[SPEAKER_01]: sign off on the job and he checked my
toolbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: All tools accounted for and I was out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Friday and I hopped in my VW van
and drove off the base and hopped on the
[SPEAKER_01]: 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got to my mom's house in Encino I
called Tim Long who had been the bass
[SPEAKER_01]: player and fellow collaborator in a few
bands I had been in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told Tim what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he was down with the idea and knew
an engineer we could hire who also played
[SPEAKER_01]: drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name was Joe Remersa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him if Joe was tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told Tim I knew Joe briefly from North
Hollywood High School.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next part of the puzzle was where to
find a Thai girl to sing on the tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drove over to Tim's house in Studio City
which was up a driveway that went south
[SPEAKER_01]: from Ventura Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim was subletting the place from Charles
Polacek aka Chaz or as he became known on
[SPEAKER_01]: stage Wade Charles the 23rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chaz lived in the unit above Tim's and was
a talented guitar player who had been in a
[SPEAKER_01]: few bands with Tim and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were up in Chaz's apartment overlooking
the valley below and I gave them a fully
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired pep talk about my idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were mesmerized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful Thai girls in a band sounded
great on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a while the spell wore off and Chaz
became noncommittal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with Chaz on the fence Tim and I
still had to find at least one Thai girl
[SPEAKER_01]: to sing on the recording and so we
embarked on a talent scouting mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started frequenting Thai restaurants
and talking to Thai girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them were amused by the idea but
couldn't sing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally after countless pad thais and
singhas later we found a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her name was Ari.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a pretty girl with a bob cut and
she looked great in a cowboy hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found her at Chitlata West,
the Thai restaurant right below Tim and
[SPEAKER_01]: Chaz's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I borrowed $1,500 from the Navy Credit
Union and we arranged a date for the
[SPEAKER_01]: recording with Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He booked a little backhouse studio behind
a house just south of Wilshire in Beverly
[SPEAKER_01]: Hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: The studio was called The Cottage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was small but had a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in a lush backyard shaded by
jacaranda trees and the interior was wood
[SPEAKER_01]: paneled with comfy chairs and a couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a Saturday morning in late spring of 87
we recorded the rhythm tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim played bass and acoustic guitar,
Joe had the drums programmed and I put
[SPEAKER_01]: down the piano track.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the afternoon Ari arrived with her
husband and we started knocking out her
[SPEAKER_01]: yippee-i-yo-kayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we asked her to compose some Thai
lyrics to go along with the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: song and while she was doing that I played
a keyboard slide on a Yamaha DX7.
[SPEAKER_01]: I nailed it in one take.
[SPEAKER_01]: By then Ari had come up with the lyrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: She did a great job for being on the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite line translated to old uncle
cowboy stay a while come listen to a song
[SPEAKER_05]: and play some music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ari sang her lyrics and then recorded the
spoken word at the end of the tune and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we realized we had no lead vocals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all three of us, Tim, Joe and myself
recorded a lead vocal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Joe put a rough mix of all three
vocals on a cassette and Tim and I took it
[SPEAKER_01]: to my mom's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew right away that Joe was the lead
singer from the moment I heard him put
[SPEAKER_01]: down his vocal but to keep things fair I
had my mom pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia had been in show business and was
unquestionably qualified to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: She listened to all three versions and
picked Joe's vocal without hesitation and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how Joe Romerzo got his first lead
singer gig.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finished the lead vocals and mixing
back at the cottage a week later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe's vocal had an element of humor and
playfulness which later manifested itself
[SPEAKER_01]: in a stage persona.
[SPEAKER_01]: After recording the song we scheduled a
promo photo session at my mom's house and
[SPEAKER_01]: shot a few Polaroids with all of us
wearing cowboy hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later that week on Friday I typed an
introductory letter to Tom Schnabel and
[SPEAKER_01]: drove to Santa Monica with the letter,
a Polaroid and a cassette.
[SPEAKER_01]: KCRW was in a basement on the campus of
Santa Monica City College.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in and asked to talk to Tom
Schnabel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't there but an assistant showed me
where his desk was and said I could leave
[SPEAKER_01]: the promo pack there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I neatly arranged the letter in the middle
of the desk and put the Polaroid in the
[SPEAKER_01]: center of the letter, weighted the down
with the cassette and drove home.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next night I was celebrating with
Kenny Miller who had just taken the bar
[SPEAKER_01]: exam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in his hotel room in Pasadena and
the phone rings and it's my mom telling me
[SPEAKER_01]: she just got off the phone with Tom
Schnabel and he was planning to play Old
[SPEAKER_01]: Cow Hand on Morning Becomes Eclectic that
next Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Monday Tom played the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great and then a few months
passed and I was talking to Kenny Miller
[SPEAKER_01]: and he said what's happening with Soy
Cowboy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem to have dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hit hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Monday and I was at Sickbay on
bass at NAS Point Magoo getting some
[SPEAKER_01]: dental work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up the phone in the hall and
called KCRW and asked to speak to Tom
[SPEAKER_01]: Schnabel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom got on the phone and I told him who I
was and right away he was asking me to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the band in for a live performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said sure but I need a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put me on the phone with Ariana
Morgenstern, his producer, and we set a
[SPEAKER_01]: date for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so I got us a gig but there was no
band.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had made one recording of one song and
now we're going to play KCRW live.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big question was who was we?
[SPEAKER_01]: I called Tim and Joe and they agreed to do
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to talk Chaz into playing
guitar as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe had programmed the drums on his drum
machine and we needed to find a few more
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai singers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim and I were back talent scouting for
female Thai vocalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: LA and in particular Hollywood had a few
upscale Thai restaurants with good-looking
[SPEAKER_01]: waitresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But could any sing and did they want to be
in the world's first Thai Western band?
[SPEAKER_01]: A term later coined by Schnabel himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim and I scoured three Chandarras.
[SPEAKER_01]: Larchmont, Kohanga, and Pico Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We visited Tommy Tang's on Melrose,
Gelato West below his apartment on
[SPEAKER_01]: Ventura, which has its own little story
for another time, Thai Town further down
[SPEAKER_01]: Melrose, and a restaurant next to Jumbo's
Clown Room on Hollywood Boulevard east of
[SPEAKER_01]: Western.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't remember its name but it is now
called Krung Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a willing waitress at Chandara in
Larchmont named Thu My Thao Patom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thu My was beautiful and had a coy
sectioness about her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was always pleasant and had a radiant
smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found an actual singer at Thai Town on
Melrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai Town catered to Thais mostly and had
live Thai music nightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The singers, mostly female, were
accompanied by a cheesy organ played by a
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai guy with a drum machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: One Friday night during this time,
after driving into town from Point Magoo,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kenny Miller and I watched the show at
Thai Town while eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The singer was singing traditional popular
Thai love songs before Thai music became
[SPEAKER_01]: sappy westernized pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there wasn't an eye in the restaurant
that wasn't watching her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kenny was mesmerized and he said,
I'd marry her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim and I came back the next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to the singer, Candy Manessy was
the name she went by, and she said she'd
[SPEAKER_01]: give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we had three singers, Arie,
Thu My, and Candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, I had rented a small room and a
house in Sherman Oaks that I would use on
[SPEAKER_01]: the weekends from a friend of Kenny's
whose name alludes me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The house had a piano and a living room
and no one was ever there except me
[SPEAKER_01]: usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember writing our first original
song, Lily Pads and Rock Cod, one Friday
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon after driving into town from the
base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Song was written in under an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music and lyrics just came to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flatbeds and watermelons on a dusty road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it seem like I have no home?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for something.
What are you looking for, cowboy?
[SPEAKER_01]: We started rehearsing in my mom's garage
on Alonzo Place in Encino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mumsy was used to bands rehearsing in the
garage and would come out and watch at
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But scheduling six people was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the six-year life of the band's
first incarnation, it never got any
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Zoe Cowboy's height, we had eight
people in the band, three girls and five
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rarely was there a rehearsal with
everybody they knew there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In mom's garage, we worked on Old Cow Hand
and a new song called Lily Pads.
[SPEAKER_01]: We threw in a Marty Robbins song,
Saddle Tramp, and another newly written
[SPEAKER_01]: song, Back at the Grace Hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do the KCRW show, I had to get
permission to take the day off from my
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate commanding officer, Senior Chief
Don O'Shaleen, a very cool supervisor who
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me with difficult jobs,
let me read him essays, and who was also
[SPEAKER_01]: an avionics technician.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked at the reason for the request
and approved it, laughing in his unique
[SPEAKER_01]: and ironic way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The day came.
[SPEAKER_01]: We played KCRW.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show was Tom Schnabel's Morning
Becomes Eclectic, and you had to get there
[SPEAKER_01]: early in the morning, and the band easily
checked the eclectic box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was our first gig, and we would be
live on the radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dragged our equipment down into the
KCRW basement located in a building on the
[SPEAKER_01]: campus of Santa Monica City College.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom introduced himself and his producer,
Ariana, to the band, as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We set up in the studio, and it was a bit
cramped with cables running everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was showtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom started talking about cassettes that
he had received, and now here's the
[SPEAKER_01]: recording of Soy Cowboy's first ever gig
and the first of many KCRW shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Courtesy of Vince Nicoletti, and I put it
into the machine, and I listened to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We receive a lot of cassette tapes,
most of them not really solicited,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we hardly have a chance to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being an eclectic station with a wide
format, we get tapes in all shapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes, colors, styles, from real B-grade
stuff to occasionally, and not that often
[SPEAKER_00]: really, something really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vince Nicoletti's tape and music was one
of the good ones, and certainly one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most unusual ones that we've gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, it mixes country and
western music with Thai vocals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, without further ado, I'd like to
welcome you, Vince Nicoletti, and your
[SPEAKER_00]: band, Soy Cowboy, to the station.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff, let's raise the volume a little bit
up there so we can hear everybody talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like you, first of all,
to maybe explain, tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about your band, and maybe introduce the
members before we get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Tom, what I wanted to do,
actually, was put two parts of my soul
[SPEAKER_02]: into some music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Thailand and fell in love with
the culture and the people, and when I
[SPEAKER_02]: came back here, I left part of my heart
there, so I decided that I could put it
[SPEAKER_02]: together in this little project here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I've done, and I've
gathered together a great bunch of people
[SPEAKER_02]: here, and we have a great time doing this
little project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the kind of music that we like
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What he's trying to tell you is he's a
wacko, and he's aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Vince there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Vince, why don't you... Strike up
the band!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, well, strike up the band,
also introduce the band members,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then let's go into our first tune.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four tunes that you're going to
perform for us, so let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this is Joe Remursa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sings and plays drum machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drum machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Tim Long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!
[SPEAKER_02]: AKA The Lengthy One.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Wade Chaz on guitar here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our hired gun for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these beautiful young ladies are
Candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari, and Tumi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see, you have one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a seven-piece band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven-person band.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, seven-piece band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'll shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percy of Soy Cowboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, boys, you ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's saddle up this beast and ride it,
huh?

[SPEAKER_00]: The group is Soy Cowboy here at KCRW 89.9
FM.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to know if you guys are
performing any place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Tom, we're working with Brendan
Mullen right now and getting a show
[SPEAKER_02]: together at the lingerie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's trying to organize a kind of a
genre around this idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably sometime this fall early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vince.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up by Soy Cowboy, I guess we have
Lily Pads and Rock and Roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Lily Pads and Rock Cart.
You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a story about Lily.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I first left the States and
headed to Thailand, I was just still
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always looking for something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I taught my horse to swim.
[SPEAKER_04]: I waterproofed my boots and swam to
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I got to Thailand, I was might be
hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went looking for a chili dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when I found her.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Lily.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Lily Pads.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still hear her now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flatbeds and watermelons on a dusty road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does it seem like I have no home?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lily Pads and Rock Cart dancing in the
stream.
[SPEAKER_04]: She takes my money more for a curtsy slice
of bananas to the pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soft is the skin of the moonlight at
night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Merciless is the slap as the sun hits my
face causing such a disgrace.
[SPEAKER_04]: A breeze off the water adds to my facade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meet me at the go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: With a tapioca broad, I'm looking for
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool the eyes, not revealing too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Warm is the rain as it runs off the roof
down to the stream.
Cool the eyes, not revealing too much.
Cool the eyes, not revealing too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's painful to leave here, but I really
must get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fruit is delicious, but there's a bad
taste in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I meet that someone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Time takes a color from an old Polaroid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fade, yes it may, but there's really no
way I can go back in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to KCRW Santa Monica and
Morning Becomes Eclectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tom Schnabel with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the studio performing live for your
listening pleasure is Soy Cowboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, oh okay, go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may or may not have been written by
Marty Robbins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really call me a drifter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say I'm no good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never amount to a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I may be a drifter and I may be no
good, but there's joy in the song that I
[SPEAKER_04]: sing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm as free as the breeze and I ride where
I please that old tram.
[SPEAKER_04]: A night I will rest beneath a blanket of
blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt if I ever will change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I might even dream of a lady I knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might even whisper her name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I might even wind up in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_04]: And visit a cute little miss.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sweet little someone I used to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might even stop long enough for a kiss
that old tram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I might even ride back to Thailand
someday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might even stop for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Though Brandon will never, I'll never be
tied down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trapped by a fair lady smile.
Saddle tram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saddle tram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm as free as the breeze and I ride where
I please that old tram.
Saddle tram.
Saddle tram.
Well I might even sign up to get your baby
kiss.
Saddle tram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry did I, did I interrupt you Tom
that last time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody ever hear of the Grace Hotel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't all answer at once here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is going to be the last song
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I get my drummer ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drummer's been drinking too much I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wig of you drummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This song is called Back at the Grace
Hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another Vince Nicoletti original.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down in the coffee shop the taxi driver
sits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surrounded by the sound of three
jukeboxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next door at the beer garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beef salad on a plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm up in my room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Waiting by the pool in the tropic sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll have another Coca Cola.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon I will be back in the shade.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I traveled far for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arabs to the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Germans to the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm such a Yankee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm alright.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I'm feeling cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hundred and ten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down at the Grace Hotel.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I'm feeling cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hundred and ten.
[SPEAKER_06]: Down at the Grace Hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little place about to block the
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got the best but it's got some
needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I've never strayed too far from
this room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back at the Grace Hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up a log.
[SPEAKER_01]: To this day Tim, Joe and Chaz are some of
my closest friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without their help and talent I never
would have been able to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime after the show Tom mentioned the
high production value on the recording
[SPEAKER_01]: which was due to Joe's engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Schnabel and I became good friends and
still are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I always tried to get Joe to go
back to Thailand with me it was Tom who
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up on that adventure a few years
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that first show on KCRW Soy Cowboy
found a video director, cool gigs in LA
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs and eventually a record deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first I had to deal with the US Navy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was inevitable that over the band's
first six years some of the guys would end
[SPEAKER_01]: up with some of the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which can be a recipe for disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: We eventually got a real drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: None other than Brian Glasscock a truly
lovable Englishman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who had been in the motels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I nicknamed him Phallus Kristallis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were eight girls in the six-year
life of our first go-round with Soy Cowboy
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would like to thank every one of
them for their time and hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Arie and I don't remember her
last name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tumi Talpatom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Candy Manasee also known as Kanda
Pita-kun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moi and I can't remember her last name
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Priya Kusuponan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah Sihaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leela Uttasinghe and Anne Suksamaran.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arie wrote the lyrics for Old Cow Hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Candy wrote most of the Thai lyrics for
the band after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Priya and Sarah contributed to writing
after Candy left the band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank them mostly for going
along with such a wacky one-of-a-kind
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks from the bottom of my heart.
