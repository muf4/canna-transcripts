[SPEAKER_04]: It's been about a week since the update.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are on week six of the testers from
Boneyard and the cherry pie and Bruce
[SPEAKER_04]: Banner number three that he sent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, I sent Tony an update today and
he actually posted about it on his rep so
[SPEAKER_04]: if you haven't seen I'm gonna tell you
about a few of the issues that I've had
[SPEAKER_04]: with him I guess both tents but mostly
Tony's tester tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first issue was a timer issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it was one of these which has the 15
minute little prongs that you can pump out
[SPEAKER_04]: but you can see that little piece right
there so that's sticking out just enough
[SPEAKER_04]: so that when it went around it was
clicking off for like 15 minutes not to
[SPEAKER_04]: mention instead of unplugging this I tried
to get my arms into a really tight spot
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was trying to punch it in like this
not really able to see so when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: setting it for what I thought was 13 hours
and 11 hours I was actually setting it to
[SPEAKER_04]: 1410 which initiated flower but it kind of
stalled it out a little bit and then that
[SPEAKER_04]: extra 15 minutes it just didn't really it
didn't like it so finally when I
[SPEAKER_04]: recognized the problem the issue which was
I don't know about 10 12 days ago now I
[SPEAKER_04]: switched the timer to 1212 I was getting
fancy and I should secondly my Fluence
[SPEAKER_04]: bioengineering spider 2x was starting to
have some maybe driver issues or cord
[SPEAKER_04]: connectivity issues but there was
something going on one of the videos I was
[SPEAKER_04]: doing in for a Facebook group the light
just turned off it just went
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Tony I know but I know you're right
you're right but the light just turned off
[SPEAKER_04]: so I was I was kind of caught off guard I
didn't along with the timer thing
[SPEAKER_04]: happening now I had that the the light
actually turning off on itself and then
[SPEAKER_04]: coming back on at random times I had no
idea it was doing that so I caught it then
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was like you were watching yeah I
was like what the fuck is going on so you
[SPEAKER_04]: know tapping it and you know supreme grape
you're not wrong they are risky and the
[SPEAKER_04]: digital ones are any of the timers are
risky I wish there was a a real foolproof
[SPEAKER_04]: way to do it you know even me going by my
own clock if I went to try and turn it on
[SPEAKER_04]: and turn it off at 1212 that that's not
gonna work I have too much stuff going on
[SPEAKER_04]: to be here right at that moment but yeah
that's what mine started doing big jar
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly and when I show you all I'll show
you right where the single blade lead
[SPEAKER_04]: started coming out I was like well this
isn't right there's gonna be something
[SPEAKER_04]: going on I there were no light I mean no
light leaks that would affect anything so
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked the timer boom that was it smart
plugs smart plugs the why are those the
[SPEAKER_04]: Wi-Fi ones Tony that like alert your phone
if the timer goes weird ganja girl how's
[SPEAKER_03]: it going man yeah I just I wish there was
a true foolproof way foolproof way I guess
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said number two rule of the galaxy
right be aware I just should have paid
[SPEAKER_04]: better attention so okay so we've talked
about one two three right lights timer
[SPEAKER_04]: light timer is that is that only two feel
like there's something else that real
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin got me boogered ah heat thank you
Tony also number three we had this like
[SPEAKER_04]: weird spell of almost a straight week of
abnormal high temperatures in on the coast
[SPEAKER_04]: of Maine we were like eighty nine ninety
degrees so with the lights on my ten even
[SPEAKER_04]: with my AC running was at like eighty
seven degrees I mean I had the fan on I
[SPEAKER_04]: had this big fan blowing the AC right in
here there's nothing I can do so like a
[SPEAKER_04]: week of really high fucking temps in it it
so here's that comes in threes thing right
[SPEAKER_04]: and that all happened within like 10 days
of each other or at least I noticed it all
[SPEAKER_04]: within probably less than 10 days but I'll
give myself a little buffer and say 10
[SPEAKER_04]: days all within 10 days so it was like
boom boom boom so here's the thing these
[SPEAKER_04]: testers have now been tested like legit
stress fucking tested during the the weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: that if you stress out your girls they are
gonna show you some fucked up signs of
[SPEAKER_04]: like wanting to do something that you
don't want them to do I I eat manners
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning of seeds whatever else may occur
these are showing nothing these are
[SPEAKER_04]: showing no signs of any manners no shot no
signs of any any hermaphroditic traits at
[SPEAKER_04]: all the only thing was a little bit of
revenge for probably about a week and now
[SPEAKER_04]: they are like they're firing off so no
thank you Tony I mean that pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: bulletproof I would I would say so man
like I mean I generally take good care of
[SPEAKER_04]: my plants and like it just goes to show
you no matter how good you take care of
[SPEAKER_04]: your stuff there's there can always be
something that pops up that like you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: plan for and that's why I always like when
people say what is what's the number one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing you would tell new growers and I go
with I go with patience and don't panic
[SPEAKER_04]: like that's the number one rule of the
galaxy after all don't panic so I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: panic and things you know if I had panic
who knows what I would have done been a
[SPEAKER_04]: moron and added a bunch of stuff put more
gypsum in or more kelp or more alfalfa you
[SPEAKER_04]: know what I mean like just and like oh no
but it was it was something easy and just
[SPEAKER_04]: like the light schedule you know and what
we'll go into 10 10 reports from seeds out
[SPEAKER_03]: of 144 crosses I made with the angel yeah
I don't have anything to say man I'm just
[SPEAKER_04]: the other day I was like these things when
you guys see these come out if they if
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony likes them enough to send them out
it's like you guys better jump on these
[SPEAKER_04]: because these things are I don't know what
I don't even know if I can kill them you
[SPEAKER_04]: know what I mean I might chop them and
they might just fucking keep growing end
[SPEAKER_04]: up like a little shop of horrors or
something but let's take you in there it
[SPEAKER_04]: is Dennis here you're right you know I
mean mistakes come in lots of different
[SPEAKER_04]: forms some big some small but as long as
you keep your keep your head level and
[SPEAKER_04]: don't panic and just kind of keep one foot
going in front of the other forward like
[SPEAKER_04]: things are gonna work out in a in a
positive way and they may not always be
[SPEAKER_04]: the positive way that you are searching
for it may be the positive way that you
[SPEAKER_04]: need and in saying that it may be actually
a negative feeling to you that makes you
[SPEAKER_04]: change doing something you know so life is
funny and things work out that way you
[SPEAKER_04]: know we was it the Rolling Stones right
you can't always get what you want you get
[SPEAKER_04]: what you need so it comes in sometimes we
need that that anvil to drop on us out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the sky to really make us see something
differently you know perpetual harvest um
[SPEAKER_04]: so I have one of those going at the other
grow I don't have one here I just I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have any care to do a perpetual here I
haven't really found the exact you know if
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna use a perpetual in my living
soil bed
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking hard I'm too lazy to set it up
like that I have no want to do that yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do that of it my buddy's place yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: like I mean Tony I I'm not gonna pretend
to know anything about breeding because I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't I've heard you talk about breeding
and it's like I pick up little bits and
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces each time and sometimes I'm able to
put them together and form a sentence and
[SPEAKER_04]: other times I like keywords you know of
which I can't remember for shit right now
[SPEAKER_04]: I do but it's like so okay let's take a
look at the garden I've been fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking with you guys long enough putting
it off
[SPEAKER_04]: okay so here we are we have six different
Athenos now I want you to notice something
[SPEAKER_04]: here see this light color right light
color on this plant and you can see a
[SPEAKER_04]: lighter lighter color on that plant over
there what's going on this this side a
[SPEAKER_04]: really nice beautiful full green right two
plants over there just like kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: yo we're not digging something but it's
just us two so which leads me to believe
[SPEAKER_04]: that they are possessing similar genetic
qualities right because right in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of them is another plant and look
green green so this could be I you know
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I'm not sure to be honest but
it's something I noticed that is only
[SPEAKER_04]: happening with those two and there's one
in the middle and there's one on the both
[SPEAKER_04]: sides of it so I'm leaning towards it can
only be genetic and whereas though I
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't grown any of the parental lines I
can't honestly say which side it's leaning
[SPEAKER_04]: towards so Bob's cheddar thank you Tony I
I don't I appreciate that man that's that
[SPEAKER_04]: is special I I don't I don't I'm usually
not choked up for words but I don't even
[SPEAKER_04]: have words to of appreciation for you that
would seem appropriate I don't know the
[SPEAKER_04]: words so right now I'm hugging my phone is
what I'm doing okay and get a big hug from
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheddar Bob
[SPEAKER_04]: no I haven't seen any variegation none
none at all actually on on any of these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants now what so just for FYI when I'm
going over the plants and you see this
[SPEAKER_04]: residue here that is residue from the the
botanogard Bavaria bossiana that is not PM
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no mold anywhere on these plants
so that's what that is so don't even
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking ask the question yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: that I mean so these are the the Bruce
Banner three cross with space cheese which
[SPEAKER_04]: is the blue cheese crossed with Tony Angel
which if I correct me if I'm wrong Tony is
[SPEAKER_04]: the 2005 cataract Kush crossed with the 95
Romulan or maybe the other way around am I
[SPEAKER_04]: right on those trying to remember oh and I
got a well actually I didn't so I ordered
[SPEAKER_04]: the was it goji go was it goji or joji
joji cherry was that was that what it was
[SPEAKER_04]: so I ordered that from Daga 96 Romulan and
05 cataract so I I got I was a year off on
[SPEAKER_04]: the Romulan and backwards on the parental
lineage but I'm getting there man I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: getting there almost there no I'm not even
almost but I'm trying so what was I saying
[SPEAKER_04]: yes gone Joji so I ordered that from Daga
and I got like a Peter sent me a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of stuff I want to show you guys
this is funny so every time Peter sends me
[SPEAKER_04]: a handwritten note okay so I have a little
I have a little clipboard with like
[SPEAKER_04]: autographs and notes that I've gotten from
people so I keep Peters on here and this
[SPEAKER_04]: one says Cheddar Bob each seed pack
lovingly licked and sealed by more Peter
[SPEAKER_04]: long pipes it says eat your veggies so he
sent me like ten packs of vegetable seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: he's and I ordered the gun Joji along with
the Aladdin skunk you know just to try
[SPEAKER_04]: something different and I received the
Aladdin skunk the ten packs of seeds I got
[SPEAKER_04]: a a pack of the four pack of the friends
which is awesome which means I can pop
[SPEAKER_04]: those and still keep my full pack which is
it's special you know I want to hold on to
[SPEAKER_04]: that so but I didn't get the gun Joji it
didn't show up it wasn't in there so I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like oh man so he said he I emailed him
and he sent it but you know I have another
[SPEAKER_04]: one from from Peter long pipes it's a hugs
and kisses your pal Peter long pipes but
[SPEAKER_04]: those are on the clipboard along with a
signature from Paul tag liaboo at the
[SPEAKER_04]: restaurant I used to work at he came in
former president of the NFL so it says go
[SPEAKER_04]: Patriots and Al Davis because I told him I
was named after a Oakland player and then
[SPEAKER_04]: I have on this as well something that's
pretty special to me this was the aircraft
[SPEAKER_04]: carrier my father served on the USS
America in Vietnam he had listened when he
[SPEAKER_04]: was 17 and went when he was 18 and he was
deck boss the Brown team I think that's
[SPEAKER_04]: what they were called Brown Brown squad
Brown team he was deck boss at 19 like a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole squad of fucking people which is I
don't know I think that's pretty fucking I
[SPEAKER_04]: couldn't imagine being in charge of people
at war at 19 years old you know and this
[SPEAKER_04]: was a postcard that he sent to his
brothers back from where was he oh he was
[SPEAKER_04]: in Guantanamo Bay at the time yeah so it's
kind of cool just to have that and then
[SPEAKER_04]: under that we have a Cedric we miss you or
we missed you signed by Phil Mickelson who
[SPEAKER_04]: was at the at my sister's restaurant a few
summers ago so my sister when she lived
[SPEAKER_04]: out in San Francisco she worked at a place
called Rubicon and she got me Steve
[SPEAKER_04]: Young's autograph Robert De Niro's
autograph but I think those are at my
[SPEAKER_04]: mom's some house somewhere so yeah but I
Peter Long pipes that's so funny and his
[SPEAKER_04]: only fans I can't I can't believe that
stuck as well as it did I like it like it
[SPEAKER_04]: blows my mind but it fits for some reason
and I really really I really enjoy saying
[SPEAKER_04]: on the on the chat you know let's stop and
I'll give our glory and praise to our Lord
[SPEAKER_04]: and Savior Peter Long pipes in the Sun he
gave us for his sins 303 organics cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that hilarious so it is what it is
all right okay um so you can see structure
[SPEAKER_04]: wise these things are starting to fill out
but I here I'll show you you can see where
[SPEAKER_04]: they started reveging right one two three
see these little me one two little single
[SPEAKER_04]: blade here right so they definitely had
about a week of revenge so instead of
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe eight to ten weeks these are
probably gonna take into the third week of
[SPEAKER_04]: July to finish I'm hoping temperatures
stay low but if they don't I'm just gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have to grin and bury you know and it's
it's my own fault but as of right now I
[SPEAKER_04]: really feel like ah mr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Emerson Saku how's it going bro thanks for
joining in for a moment appreciate your
[SPEAKER_04]: view edge as of right now I'm I feel like
they're going pretty well but I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: take you back into this corner and show
you the structure of these these things I
[SPEAKER_04]: might be able to hammer a nail with this
even like not dry these things are rock
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking hard and I'm really hoping that
they you know follow the characteristics
[SPEAKER_04]: of the rest of Tony's gear and what I mean
by that is having and being bred for
[SPEAKER_04]: really high medicinal value and not just
looks like a lot of breeders do Tony
[SPEAKER_04]: breeds Tony breeds for intent for medical
purposes his purposes aren't bag appeal
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily he likes good-looking plants
don't get me wrong but it's it's about
[SPEAKER_04]: helping an ailment for him you know that's
what all of his lines have have been based
[SPEAKER_04]: off of hey Ryan how's it going man are all
space cheese angel okay well here we go
[SPEAKER_04]: man I mean check these things out like
these are legit rocks like I don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to touch them so I'm not
going to but like and they're not done
[SPEAKER_04]: they're rocks the secondaries are rocks so
again this is not PM this is WP 22
[SPEAKER_04]: botanogard so let's see the new I replaced
the fluence with this is called the ion
[SPEAKER_04]: ion 720 apparently this is made by growers
choice but sold to ion to put their name
[SPEAKER_04]: on it so it's basically a growers choice
ion 720 with someone else's name on it
[SPEAKER_04]: basically what what spider farmer and Mars
and all those all those guys do so I got
[SPEAKER_04]: this on the low and I'm using it because I
needed another light so there we go we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: see it we'll see how we'll see how it runs
do I chase VPD no not really I mean I
[SPEAKER_04]: leave my tents open so it is what it is
you know like right now my temps are my
[SPEAKER_04]: temp is at 81 and 56 percent so yeah I got
the light up to 80 percent is it a little
[SPEAKER_04]: warm it might be what's my co2 my co2 is
at like 550 and I don't even run co2 so
[SPEAKER_04]: there we go I don't know okay so let's go
over here to the other tent ambient co2
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not bad sometimes
it gets like it when the tents are closed
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'll open it up it'll be up to like
700 or so which is good that means my
[SPEAKER_04]: soils action going on in it to be
producing some co2 I don't have any
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily like fruiting audience but the
co2 is always decently high in this tent
[SPEAKER_04]: so Bruce Banner now Tony I was talking to
you about this the other day and I believe
[SPEAKER_04]: I am on a boat supreme I'm always on a
boat man I was born from the ocean born
[SPEAKER_04]: out of salt water man um so let's see here
see the crowning little fox tailing right
[SPEAKER_04]: now I'm thinking it is my life because I
had a pink gorilla fino that stretched
[SPEAKER_04]: very similar to the banner that also ended
up doing that crown sort of foxtail so but
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I mean flowers look great I'm
definitely not bummed out about the way
[SPEAKER_04]: the the flowers go looking up the stalk I
am a little bummed out at the top flower
[SPEAKER_04]: you know but everything going up is
looking really nice so it just leads me to
[SPEAKER_04]: believe that this this LED is just too
strong now if we come down to where the
[SPEAKER_04]: cherry pie is look at that look what's not
doing that right I mean this cherry pie is
[SPEAKER_04]: like fucking ridiculous right now and it
still has what two weeks I think I mean I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean come on I mean come on look at the
calyxes look at those look at the calyxes
[SPEAKER_04]: there's like there's like there's a little
bit of leaf do you know how easy that is
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be to trim
[SPEAKER_04]: that's gonna be so easy to trim ceramic
metal halide down to 315 watts and this is
[SPEAKER_04]: turned down to oh probably 70 70 percent
so we'll see we'll see what happens I know
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get a decent yield and I have
some clones of the Bruce Banner that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna run for a second time in one of the
tents I may take it up to my buddies and
[SPEAKER_04]: use one of his tents I'm not sure yet but
I do have some because I want to run it
[SPEAKER_04]: again and see if it was the lights and see
if the structure changes a whole lot under
[SPEAKER_04]: you know getting to know it better so and
then I definitely took cuttings of this
[SPEAKER_04]: cherry pie which I am going to actually
I've already got a plan I'm gonna refill
[SPEAKER_04]: this bed with cherry pie and I think I'm
gonna I want to put like 12 of them in
[SPEAKER_04]: here not really maybe maybe 18 of them in
solo cups you know just fucking jam them
[SPEAKER_04]: right in the vegum up to the screen or
even take the fucking screen right off and
[SPEAKER_04]: and veg them for like two weeks and flour
them because that cherry pie is fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: phenomenal I really am enjoying the way it
looks yeah baby yeah sog them in the bed
[SPEAKER_04]: you think it's it's so what do what would
you say that it is to too much in to make
[SPEAKER_04]: them do that too much too much UV maybe or
too much far red I have not mainly OG you
[SPEAKER_04]: know I branch I branch trim so you know
down here all I have to do is is boom take
[SPEAKER_04]: that right there and either you know just
pull that up through or or whatnot but
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I don't I don't lose anything I
always I always you know lollipop right up
[SPEAKER_04]: to right up to the lobster trap wire just
for that reason the first time I use
[SPEAKER_04]: lobster trap wire I actually I made that
mistake there's a cursory
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know he does it a lot differently
than I do it he keeps the flowers like
[SPEAKER_04]: like this high above his trellis screen
and they seem to be underneath as well so
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that's why I had that second
secondary trellis and really once I get to
[SPEAKER_04]: know a cultivar you know like I wouldn't
need that secondary trellis with a bed
[SPEAKER_04]: full of the cherry pie because it only
stretches that much if I were to when I
[SPEAKER_04]: run the Bruce Banner again I know that I
have two weeks of flour that I can still
[SPEAKER_04]: bend or at least 10 days that I can still
bend where things are going to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch and grow vertical so lesson
learned you know possibly it might be too
[SPEAKER_00]: much light now what I believe the problem
is is that there is no LED or supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor lighting or any lighting for that
matter that can be the correct spectrum to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant so what you're actually seeing
there is missing spectrum that's causing
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant to show that structure so when
you take it to your friend's house if he
[SPEAKER_00]: has a whole different set of lights with a
better spectrum or a different spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: not a better one but one that might have a
stuff that it can add that you're missing
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to show a totally different
structure on that plant that Bruce Banner
[SPEAKER_00]: mine outside look different than yours and
your plant came from my mom mine aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: crowning down as bad as yours and my buds
are actually a lot larger and I'm using
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sun along with a 250 watt bipolar
spectra just to add light to the back
[SPEAKER_00]: corners where the Sun can't actually reach
and I'm getting the same stretch that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting but I don't have the color
you have even though that Bruce Banner is
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter she's just a heavier feeding girl
is what it is so because I knew that I up
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of nutrients in the area that I
was gonna put her in so that she has
[SPEAKER_00]: access to a little bit more nutrients in
there she's gonna want to eat more
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen earlier she needs more phosphorus
earlier and then as she goes into flour
[SPEAKER_00]: she's gonna need more magnesium potassium
and calcium and all those if they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: build up in the tissue during veg you're
gonna have issues with her showing very
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly in flower that's just how that
plant reacts and the cherry pie it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: act differently she doesn't feed us hard
so she's looking greener in that garden
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got her nutrient levels met
so that what's happening is is the Bruce
[SPEAKER_00]: Banner is just starving is all it is she
just wants to be fed more but if you feed
[SPEAKER_00]: that cherry pie like the Bruce you're
gonna get the morphidites off that cherry
[SPEAKER_04]: pie isn't that crazy man how those two
plants on and then one in the middle it
[SPEAKER_04]: just shows you like genetics like crazy
like like you never know you know what I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean I mean maybe some people know maybe
you know but as a as a as a simple home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower I don't I don't know you know what
I mean like I said I've been I spent too
[SPEAKER_00]: much time growing plants and that's all I
know like I don't know shit about lobster
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing none of that shit right but I can
tell you about cannabis plants and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you about the ones that I've got
experience with I won't try to chime in
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time with shit I've never fucked
with but if I've grown that like my
[SPEAKER_00]: priority outside I've had that plant for
15 years I know exactly what it was like I
[SPEAKER_00]: know the patterns it's gonna go through I
know when it's gonna flower when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna finish when you need to pollinate
that plant those are all things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: basic botanical science with the plant but
you only learn through experience or
[SPEAKER_00]: paying the fucking attention to other
people that have had experience and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what I that's what I was saying like as I
as I grow this Bruce Banner multiple times
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna learn more about it and how it
how it and what it likes in my environment
[SPEAKER_00]: you know yeah she's a heavy feeder it
comes through the both the sour diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: the OG side but it's also got an issue
where if you push too hard with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen like a transition that can give
you issues that's why I'm always telling
[SPEAKER_00]: people not to top dress a lot of amino
acids right at the switch with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because you can cause like that
cherry pie if you dump a bunch of fish
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrosilicate or soy proteins on that
plant right at transition you will get a
[SPEAKER_00]: more for diets on the bottom of the plant
and that's just going to be a phenotypical
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the environment that you put
it into doesn't mean that plants are more
[SPEAKER_00]: for that that when a plants are more for
that it always produces move to the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: on a specific time and a specific date
every growth it isn't gonna change her
[SPEAKER_00]: morpho diets are gonna show up on day 15
or maybe it's day 27 whatever it is if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that plant was that and it does do it
it will do it every time a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: changes through inputs is just a
endogenous hormone stress indicator it's
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you something in that room isn't
happy with that plan you can see that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bob's cheddar can't when you can see
that four of the plants out of the six are
[SPEAKER_00]: responding better to the environment than
the other two and then you can go over to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other team and see the mother to the
two that aren't responding well is also
[SPEAKER_00]: having issues with some of the soil
because it's also growing lighter in color
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know I'm talking about it's having
issues with the crowning of the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a way for you to see that that
environmental issues are causing on
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and not just one point like that
Bruce Banner is passing something over to
[SPEAKER_00]: the progeny that can affect him
phenotypically not on a genotype level the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes stay the same and every seeds a
different genotype but that phenotypal
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the genotype makeup of that
plant is being swayed by the same traits
[SPEAKER_00]: from the parent line to the project so
it's easy to see when you have both plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's that's a jumpstart in me given
not just you but anyone I offered like a
[SPEAKER_00]: parent plant to and the progeny it's a way
for them to see those types of things when
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go over to the other tent in the
same area that's got the same soil mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same type of influence of the same
grower and notice the same stresses that
[SPEAKER_00]: are hitting both of them you start to
realize these kind of things I can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: almost anything that's crossed to a Bruce
Banner number three and possibly the OG or
[SPEAKER_00]: the strawberry diesel in it and recognize
some of those issues in some of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not even physically related to
other than a grandparent right and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: from growing two plants that are related
the mom and the progeny by growing those
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives you a real good idea of what
could come out of that Bruce Banner line
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like having a butt chin you know like
the butt chins come out like every couple
[SPEAKER_00]: generations sometimes it's an atavistic
trait it's called atavism when a trait
[SPEAKER_00]: from a past generation shows up in this
generation and it wasn't from the parental
[SPEAKER_00]: generation it's called atavism so it's a
trait that can show up at any time too it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean it shows up on that seed on
the first grow might take 10 grows before
[SPEAKER_00]: it shows up on that seed it might take a
buildup in swaying that endogenous hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's causing it to happen or the set of
traits that are dictating it to be swayed
[SPEAKER_00]: through epigenetics before it actually
starts to show as part of that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: system isn't that crazy so so then if you
were to breed something would you would
[SPEAKER_02]: you breed it out that far to yeah like if
you had a question about it i mean i know
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have to but if you saw my space
cushion angel i have i've bred that to a
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross seven to the male i've reversed
the male and i've reversed the females
[SPEAKER_00]: i've done f2s and threes f4s for that one
that's how i know my line's bulletproof
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just me saying it's bulletproof i
can tell you that because of like i said
[SPEAKER_00]: out of probably a million seeds i've made
with angel i've had 10 people call me back
[SPEAKER_00]: and say they had morphidites now a 10 out
of a million means those 10 people had
[SPEAKER_00]: issues in their garden it wasn't my ass
who made those seeds or i would have had
[SPEAKER_00]: 900 000 hemorphidites i wouldn't have had
10 of right so that's where it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into understanding endogenous
hormone stress where a lot of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even understand it or notice it you
started to see it on the space or the uh
[SPEAKER_00]: the bob's cheddar room when you started to
see in the new leaf growth that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone driven leaf growth it's not coming
from photosynthesis that's coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sway of auxins and ethylene and absensic
acid that's in that plant but those levels
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say the ratio was a step like one
two and three down right yeah if the step
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to lower down to where it's even
with the second or third step you have
[SPEAKER_00]: swayed the amount of hormones in that
plant where it's going to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely different phenotypal expression
in that garden we don't know what it could
[SPEAKER_00]: have been too much heat in your case we
know it was from the timer being switched
[SPEAKER_00]: over and having too much light in your
garden we found out what it was the timer
[SPEAKER_00]: was wrong and then the light was going on
and off and then you had a heat switch
[SPEAKER_00]: right all those things are things that are
going to affect the actual structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of that plant through endogenous
hormone levels and you have no cause on it
[SPEAKER_00]: so when people when i tell someone that
like what happened in your garden and i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying to find that info a lot of
people take that as me saying they fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden up that's not that's not at all
what happened like i was sitting here on
[SPEAKER_00]: this video watching you when your life
started going and i was did i get married
[SPEAKER_00]: was i pissed that you're testing my shit
with a bad light no this is all part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this could happen in any garden in any
room and this is my way of proving what i
[SPEAKER_00]: keep telling everyone that there's no way
for me to breed out what you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in your room doesn't mean you
caused it it means it happened in your
[SPEAKER_00]: room your environment at your area it's
got a different temperature a different
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor deficit it's got a different uh
you're at different elevation everything
[SPEAKER_00]: is different there's no way for me to
breed at my spot what you're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: at your spot it's possible so when people
say that the breeder didn't do any work to
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize the line i've been i've been
spending 20 years trying to do that work
[SPEAKER_00]: by teaching the growers that are growing
my lines it ain't me dude and it ain't you
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a nature that has made this plant do
what it's doing yep and all you got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is either take a cut and do what you want
to do it take it over to your friend's
[SPEAKER_00]: house and grow it under a different light
with different inputs to see if what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening is was you maybe what you did in
the garden affected it was it the light
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucked up which you couldn't do but
change all you can do is change the light
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not you but you could change it or
is it just that plant just fucking being a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of shit right some plants are pieces
of shit there's many options that could
[SPEAKER_00]: cause what's happening to happen and if
bless you're smart enough cat to go i want
[SPEAKER_00]: to know what's happening but when you're a
sucker you know so it could have been
[SPEAKER_00]: anything but you didn't get mad you just
dealt with it and went along with it
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what you're supposed to do too many
growers get pissed and automatically hit
[SPEAKER_00]: up the breeder and tell them they fucked
up and fucking you're putting plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of shit then they make a post to
tell you you're sucking all this as a
[SPEAKER_02]: tester it just goes to show like the
quality of the breeding you know what i
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like that's i mean i didn't know what
to expect getting testers you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: never do so it's like fucking good for the
hard time i put them through and so if
[SPEAKER_04]: they had not gone through those stressors
imagine what they would have ended up like
[SPEAKER_04]: otherwise they'd be better yeah you know
better yeah and so it just goes to show
[SPEAKER_04]: that like fucking your gear your gear is
fucking awesome what it really told me is
[SPEAKER_00]: um a lot of people have grid with bruce
banner and a lot of people have gotten bad
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses from bruce banner because of the
mail they put on it right when it paired
[SPEAKER_00]: up to that plant it either mad made uh
some bad traits that popped out of it so
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant for throwing more dates as soon
as they went in the flower uh or the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking stretched way too far one fucking
gonna handle nothing like all of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: too lanky you couldn't hold yourself up
what you're seeing is my choice through my
[SPEAKER_00]: space cheese mail which is related to my
angel mail my own word it's not some other
[SPEAKER_00]: dude shit that i read about i'm using shit
that i knew about i can tell you before
[SPEAKER_00]: you even grow that plant what might happen
to the plant if you'd have asked i could
[SPEAKER_00]: have told you you're gonna get a majority
of shorter plants out of the cross you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get stabilized plants because i've
crossed that plant to plants that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: for that like a motherfucker and the
crosses will not throw nuts i've tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse my space push line and i've done
that it doesn't like to be reversed i got
[SPEAKER_04]: a question for you does have you ever come
across a situation where like a female
[SPEAKER_04]: just will not take a certain male pollen
or like a certain male pollen always fucks
[SPEAKER_02]: up a certain cultivar female or something
like that like like they they just will
[SPEAKER_00]: not make the space cheese females will not
accept pollen they don't like i got a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: here that has all the seeds i've made in
that cross i think i might have got a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred seeds out of five pollinations off
the space cheese in the last year that's
[SPEAKER_00]: it probably seven plants that's that's not
very many right no i get like 10 000 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: off of a plant when i pollinate like the
the space cheese male that pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle kush i probably got 10 000 seeds
off a three foot plant the three foot
[SPEAKER_00]: space cheese plant next to it gave me 40
seeds 40 seeds the mac one gave me more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds than the space cheese gave me mac
one pollinated easier than space cheese
[SPEAKER_00]: and mac one won't pollinate that plant
does not like getting pollinated so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an issue with pollen tubes
actually forming in the pistol or the
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma when the stigma gets hit by a
pollen grain a pollen tube is formed that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes all the way down to the ovary which
allows gestation to happen if that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: gets distorted in any way or doesn't make
it you don't get seeds and that's what's
[SPEAKER_04]: happening with so then that can can that
be specifically bred into a line so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be it can but it takes work you can
bring sterility into a line you can you
[SPEAKER_00]: can make a whole brand new f1 that will
not accept pollen you can do that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: easy without genetic sequencing but you
can do it i mean that's what that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why they started trying to fuck with uh
fem seeds to begin with their whole plan
[SPEAKER_00]: was to try to offer a plant that they
didn't think was going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: accept pollen from a male and it didn't
end up working that way so they started
[SPEAKER_00]: making more influence and making s2s and
s3s because the farther you inbreed that
[SPEAKER_00]: way the more likely you're going to cause
that plant to become sterile i asked james
[SPEAKER_04]: loud and peter the other day when he was
on about the state of fems and such going
[SPEAKER_04]: out in the in the industry whether it be
recreational commercial home growers fems
[SPEAKER_04]: seem to be making like a a dominant fight
for the masses you know like it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminizing it's the fact that everyone is
uh breeding with plants that are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: related to each other it's part of
inbreeding depression so like all these
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie crosses that keep getting across to
each other that not only are the good
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles combining but the bad recessive
ones are also combining and becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant traits now you can make a
recessive homogenous trait becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant homogenous trait you were saying
that the other day yeah and people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get this so through breeding like if i
pick a cookie cross a cookie and cross it
[SPEAKER_00]: to my plant then i sell you the seed right
you've got an f1 of my cookie cross now
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a cookie cross from another guy
but the the other line is not even related
[SPEAKER_00]: to my line but they both have cookies so
now you cross those two together you have
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively inbred a cookie line from two
polyhybrids so what's going to happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the f1 most of the good alleles are
going to combine from the cookies not from
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plant because they're not
related they don't have an allele to pair
[SPEAKER_00]: up to there's not a pair so the plant
looks for pairs to make copies to pass
[SPEAKER_00]: that trade over because what's happening
is you've got genes and you've got alleles
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are like blue eyes or a beard or
long fingernails right and alleles are a
[SPEAKER_00]: different color eye or a different color
beard it's a form of a gene but an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate gene so if you when they're
trying to pair up to show you you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: beard you have to have two beards yeah or
if you want to have blue eyes you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: have both blue eyes so when you start to
breed two plants like yeah with the cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: from here and a cookie from here what
happens is all the good cookie chips start
[SPEAKER_00]: to combine and starts to match up these
alleles so that the plant that comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: has genes that are able to pass and breed
on in nature because all recessive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature can't breed together like if
everything was recessive they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: die out that's the problem so what happens
is you start to inbreed now you take your
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new cross and send it to another
dude and he's got a cross that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies and in his mind he thinks i'm
gonna make cookies and what he's doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: making a bad version of the cookie the
more you start to inbreed a cookie line
[SPEAKER_00]: from something that doesn't use the same
reoccurring parent as long as you if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep pollinating that open gene pool
what happens is you're gonna start pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: in all the bad shit as well as the good
shit and if you don't know how to select
[SPEAKER_00]: or you don't grow enough plants to do your
selection yeah you're more than likely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pull out the bad shit because all
you're after is smell and high and that
[SPEAKER_00]: plants got 62,000 other traits it needs to
pass out and you're not paying attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to none of them except for i wanted to
finish in eight weeks and i wanted to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like cookies and i want to smell it that's
three traits that you're trying to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for that may or may not carry 50 or 60 bad
traits with them and you don't even know
[SPEAKER_04]: that because you didn't pop enough seed
that's what i was saying about you before
[SPEAKER_04]: you came on tony i was like this is what
tony does he breeds for but he breeds for
[SPEAKER_04]: certain issues he doesn't breed for just
bag appeal and weight you know he he goes
[SPEAKER_04]: it's deeper than that for him you know
each of his lines has been bred for a
[SPEAKER_04]: specific reason a specific illness for
someone he cared about you know and that
[SPEAKER_02]: takes a lot of fucking work and a lot of
time yeah looking like a dj now 144 of
[SPEAKER_00]: them crosses from angel were all done for
medicinal purposes and i was able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that because i worked at a club with 4600
patients ain't no average reader going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to breed 144 lines and all of them
be used for medicinal purposes by himself
[SPEAKER_00]: it ain't happening man that's the whole
thing with what's going on here we got all
[SPEAKER_00]: these people out there telling you doing
all this work and they've got 170 crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: that they release and you ain't seeing the
parents to either one of them and you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't seen uh you haven't seen shit off
of them and you know they're just lives i
[SPEAKER_04]: notice a lot of places no names but a lot
of places fire off like 25 different
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars that have all been crossed with
the same male and it's it's it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: give me a good thought process it doesn't
make me feel secure i got a shitload of
[SPEAKER_00]: space cheese crosses i could be dropping
on everybody but i let my shit go through
[SPEAKER_00]: testing dude i ain't one of these buster
ass motherfuckers that because i got 112
[SPEAKER_00]: new crosses that i could drop doesn't mean
i am dropping i make 112 crosses so that
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 of them come out nice i start popping
all the seeds out of there and find out i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like what's coming out of that cross
i don't like what's coming out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross but everything right here this
shit's fucking killer right i would smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it every day so i let it go out and if
people don't like it that's on them
[SPEAKER_00]: because i'm not breeding for other
motherfuckers these days i breed for me
[SPEAKER_00]: but back in the day all i bred for was
other sick people for real man i'd bring
[SPEAKER_00]: someone in they had some kind of cancer
i'd find another 20 people in my club that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the same cancer i'd send them all out
a cut of a certain plant that i thought
[SPEAKER_00]: would work and then give them crosses of
the same plant to my angel to find out if
[SPEAKER_00]: my angel was passing what i needed in that
cross and they'd all come back and be like
[SPEAKER_00]: your cross sucked ass and i was like throw
it in the can dude i'm not giving that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out to nobody or they're like bro
what the fuck did you give me like my
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure stopped that's what happened with
angel i started giving it out to veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: who were having seizures from traumatic
brain injuries which is what my uncle had
[SPEAKER_00]: my uncle fell and hit his head when he was
19 and from that day on he had seizures
[SPEAKER_00]: like almost every day of his life dude all
the grand mal seizures he was pronounced
[SPEAKER_00]: dead from seizures three times like
legally he woke up in the morgue three
[SPEAKER_00]: times knocking on the fucking cold box bro
in a body bag from being pronounced dead
[SPEAKER_00]: for real right so i ain't fucking around
when i say that my plant was able to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures right my space cush lines the one
i lost i could have gave that to nine out
[SPEAKER_00]: of ten seizure patients and they weren't
going to have seizures anywhere close to
[SPEAKER_00]: like i had someone go from 300 seizures a
month to three right i reduced they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: they're fucking see i had another lady
that i sent my uh cindy's angel to it's uh
[SPEAKER_00]: cindy 99 across the angel it's named for
my buddy's mom who died i sent her some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds the lady is 72 years old she hadn't
had her driver's license since she was 16
[SPEAKER_00]: she smoked my line for one year she didn't
have a seizure again they gave her license
[SPEAKER_00]: back she fucking the first time she drove
since she was 16 she's 72 years old now
[SPEAKER_00]: she can drive her fucking self around all
because i sent her a line that i put work
[SPEAKER_00]: into for that specific reason right i
didn't charge her for them i just told her
[SPEAKER_00]: try them out they work for other people
they may or may not work for she never hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me back for a year so i thought they
didn't work and one day she hits me up and
[SPEAKER_00]: she sent me if i don't know if you can see
them but there's some orange jars right
[SPEAKER_00]: there she sent me these hand etched jars
with seeds inside of them to thank me for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of her seizures and i had
totally forgot about the lady right and i
[SPEAKER_00]: met her through the the pfa i met a lot of
cool people in that group even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: group was a hunk of shit at the end but i
met so many cool people in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know why they were they were in
that group to save their own lives and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was because they met people like myself
and others who weren't selling them
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit they were selling them science
they were selling them experience they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't i wasn't giving them my opinion on
shit i was giving them my experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: facts through other people i could have
just made up shit like my post today that
[SPEAKER_00]: i made about the jackass that's pushing
skunk on everyone that everyone can go and
[SPEAKER_00]: look up all the forums that i look up and
find out the shitty sayings 100% lie you
[SPEAKER_00]: could look up what i'm saying and find out
if i'm lying too and i give people the
[SPEAKER_00]: links to try to find that shit out like go
find out i'm lying and come back and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: me that it's not right and i'll change it
i'll tell you i was wrong we'll fix it
[SPEAKER_04]: right that's what it's supposed to be
about i yeah you know it's you know i i
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciate the way you approach things and
something that i not for you but i don't
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciate about breeders is the constant
the constant output of all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: different cultivars like you know like
like maybe they gotta get paid man like
[SPEAKER_04]: well i know but like i'll say like
in-house like i have a big problem with
[SPEAKER_04]: in-house and ethos ethos like always
having new things come out like every
[SPEAKER_00]: month it they're just something yeah but
why why be mad at that breeder for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that when the real problem is all the
people buying it i'm sorry i mean i i
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what you're saying i know what
you i know what you mean i i just but the
[SPEAKER_00]: real issue is the is the new people that
are coming into this thing and buying all
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit there is no track record to
prove any of those lines do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: except for fit in a box they put them in
that's it like you know why are you buying
[SPEAKER_04]: them you know that they're not setting out
and testing you know i got a box here with
[SPEAKER_00]: over 150 strains in it and i won't sell
them to you if you tried to buy them from
[SPEAKER_00]: me today right there's people hitting me
up all the time asking me to sell them to
[SPEAKER_00]: them any of them even if they're not
tested i'll buy them anyway and i'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going through testing just fucking
wait i'm not selling them right now i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like sending all my shit i'm not one
of them dudes that sends them all 27 new
[SPEAKER_00]: things that i put pollen on in just
because they fit in the box they're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them in boxes because and when i
say you i don't mean i don't mean you i
[SPEAKER_00]: just mean the community as you y'all keep
buying that shit y'all y'all keep buying
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit you guys keep listening to the
crap and you keep buying it someone puts
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk on a pack and you buy it someone
puts og on a pack and you buy it you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: ask to see the parents you don't ask to
see a test grow you don't ask to have
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody besides the breeder tell you that
shit was bomb right you don't ask any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that could keep you from getting
ripped off other than where do i get them
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cheapest fucking price that's
that's the best question everyone asks
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to cannabis seeds and for a
decade i had the cheapest seeds in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and i couldn't offer
them to you unless i put them in a package
[SPEAKER_00]: for cheaper than they were already been
there and then people asked me to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a discount then and i was like fuck
you go spend a thousand on some jackasses
[SPEAKER_00]: packs and then call me back when you want
something stable you can't find a 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_04]: pack of seeds for the prices you charge no
only a couple people man pistol positive
[SPEAKER_00]: has them my buddy pistol positive is the
only guy i know that every one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: packs is precious just like mine he's not
trying to rip you off he's trying to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you what he's proud of for a price that he
thinks they should be worth and that's it
[SPEAKER_00]: right it's up to you to put the value on
them i mean it's 30 bucks what's that
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna cost anyone it costs that much to
send a box with some cuts in it i just did
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit today 25 dollars to put fucking
10 cuts that are fully rooted in a box and
[SPEAKER_00]: send them the fuck out or you could buy
one 10 pack of seeds for 30 bucks and have
[SPEAKER_00]: endless clones for the rest of your life
if you just listen to my feed when i tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you how to clone the plant i just gave you
and i used to sell you one pack for 30 and
[SPEAKER_00]: give you another pack for free so you paid
15 dollars for my pack of seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: you got two packs right and people still
bitching because it didn't have a name
[SPEAKER_00]: that they recognized or they didn't know
who i was and that wasn't my fault the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason you don't know who i am is because
i'm not out there that's just it right one
[SPEAKER_00]: day you run across me ask me some
questions i'm not hiding just because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't moan me doesn't mean shit like we
all didn't know the next person we meet
[SPEAKER_00]: like i never knew you exactly i didn't
know you from shit and then we interacted
[SPEAKER_00]: online and became friends exactly yeah but
like if you'd have been a punk ass bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: that was just full of shit all the time i
wouldn't have been around you could be you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a sarcastic asshole i'm the same
dude but if you were full of shit with
[SPEAKER_00]: what the info you were saying i wouldn't
be here talking to you i wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: sold you no seeds none of that shit i'd
have just been like i wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: answered the fucking question i do that
all day but like we'd interacted beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: offering seeds to sell like before you
bought any seeds from me you'd already
[SPEAKER_00]: decided if i was worth fucking talking to
you know what i mean you didn't just hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me up and go let me buy those seeds
because someone else said buy them you
[SPEAKER_00]: bought them because my attitude made what
i was offering worth a try it wasn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: other way around like you didn't buy my
seeds grow them and go maybe i'll talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: that dude you had to talk to me to get
them right because my seeds weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: available at no fucking club before and at
no fucking distributor and they weren't
[SPEAKER_04]: hyped up you know i didn't know anyone
that was growing bone yard seeds you know
[SPEAKER_04]: i had just seen you and the the pfa
talking about breeding and stuff and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know i think that's where we first
interacted and i've been in there since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011 i was i was the 11th person they
asked to join that group i was hit up by
[SPEAKER_00]: alan and gage green in emails asked me to
be in the group because i had shared more
[SPEAKER_00]: information publicly than any other grower
that they had met so they wanted to know
[SPEAKER_04]: if i could do that in the group and that's
what i know that's why i got here you were
[SPEAKER_04]: you were always posting like science-based
information on cannabis plant biology soil
[SPEAKER_04]: biology pathogens fungus you were you were
and it may not be everybody's boat right
[SPEAKER_00]: like you like me and you don't think the
same way about growing to this t but like
[SPEAKER_00]: i brought up in your feed earlier it's
science like your room fucked up and what
[SPEAKER_00]: was happening was science and biology
there was no way to think about that of
[SPEAKER_00]: any other way you could have sat there and
ignored it and it was still gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have pretended it wasn't
happening and it was still gonna fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: happen you could have ignored that it
actually happened on the live feed but me
[SPEAKER_00]: and other people were watching and the
shit happened right that's what science is
[SPEAKER_00]: all about right science is the fact that
you and i both can look at something come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a reasoning for what happened and
still want to find out if there was more
[SPEAKER_00]: right that's what science is about right
science is never giving you a hard answer
[SPEAKER_00]: other than there's more to learn there's
always always that's that's what science
[SPEAKER_04]: is that's what science is there's always
more and you know what's funny is i uh i
[SPEAKER_04]: was just listening to something i remember
what it was but they were saying like
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking scientists are kind of fucking us
up with that science shit you know like
[SPEAKER_04]: shit with it you know always wanting more
you know they're like like do any of the
[SPEAKER_04]: scientists ever go like you know maybe
making a ryerson bomb out of whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't in fact scientists yeah they are who
did that brother like no i know back in
[SPEAKER_00]: here like the dude that invented the
fucking atom bomb went um we shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this shit and they went and took it
from his ass and fucking blew people up
[SPEAKER_00]: with it right when he realized what he was
doing he was like oh shit we fucked up and
[SPEAKER_00]: he went and told someone he thought would
listen and they were like oh you're fired
[SPEAKER_00]: fucker someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else is finishing the job right because
humans don't exist and i wouldn't ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: for fucking help if i was the only thing
i'd ask you for help was to help me save
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom's life or my dad's life and that's
it i wouldn't gonna ask you to help me do
[SPEAKER_00]: shit not go get gas not fucking help me
fucking get directions nothing being being
[SPEAKER_04]: a certain amount of vulnerable is actually
a great human quality yeah but you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to recognize the vulnerability
that's the problem most of us think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking uh we're we're we can't be you
know we're involved we can't we can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: killed most of us feel that all the time
and we'll say it in everybody's post right
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see someone that's just showing a
little bit of uh vulnerability and on
[SPEAKER_00]: their post we're like fuck you pussy right
and that automatically shows that you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable motherfucker but it also shows
you're too stupid to admit it because as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you admit it the vulnerability is
gone because someone else is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like dude you need help like what's going
on man we're all willing to help the next
[SPEAKER_00]: dude out accept the motherfucker that
won't accept it and won't offer none
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the only dude we're all out there
going dude fuck you yeah go lose a leg
[SPEAKER_00]: fucker yeah lose a leg you know that'll
teach you i'm seriously hey top me dog i i
[SPEAKER_00]: had a sex change and they did it by taking
my leg off bro the pussy was hiding behind
[SPEAKER_00]: my kneecap there you go let me tell you
they took that pussy right off my ass and
[SPEAKER_04]: turned me into a fucking man with a spine
like when i fell you know i wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_04]: before i fell i was necessarily uh the
nicest person but i definitely had a
[SPEAKER_04]: different i would say more passive
demeanor but after i fell and i came so
[SPEAKER_04]: close to what other people thought was
death i i knew i wasn't gonna die but i i
[SPEAKER_04]: was somewhere else you know what i mean
like i wasn't i was somewhere like when i
[SPEAKER_04]: came after i came through all of it you
know and i'd healed up i was a different
[SPEAKER_02]: person i realized how short things are and
that i can't go through life holding back
[SPEAKER_04]: on important things you know i can't i
can't be passive i can't i can't not
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's going wrong and not say
something about it it's it's just yep and
[SPEAKER_02]: before my accident i was that that person
that would see something and be like i
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't see it i didn't hear it you know
like friends using the n-word or telling
[SPEAKER_04]: jokes about black people yeah you know
what i mean like like i wasn't i wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: strong enough to stand up for my
convictions whereas though after my
[SPEAKER_04]: accident boom it was like a fucking switch
are
[SPEAKER_04]: those the banners
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the banner yeah looks like that's
the bruce banner and then i got a cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: pie in the middle and then this is a corey
and that's a corey so let's see i'll stand
[SPEAKER_00]: up here um as you'll see i don't have the
the yellowing that you have on color
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders as you'll see this is a cherry
pie right next to her this is uh this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bruce banner leaf in my hand and a cherry
pie right next to it now what's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plants you're extremely hungry so
i i'm probably choppy as a motherfucker
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry about that i'm outside here it's
hard brother um yeah what i was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you was that the bruce banner and the
cherry pie in my garden aren't losing any
[SPEAKER_00]: color like they're the exact same color
and that's because i i knew that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needed more food so i kicked up the amount
of food so what you're seeing isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually from like too much light it's
it's a combination of the spectrum being
[SPEAKER_02]: off and not enough food actually is what
it is now what do you would you have any
[SPEAKER_02]: sense of what it might be missing as far
as a spectrum on the spectrum um i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what your light is i'd have to check
the spectrum on your light but um what i
[SPEAKER_00]: feel you're missing is you're missing some
of the blue side of the spectrum on there
[SPEAKER_00]: that light has a lot of red um and that's
because all leds use too much fucking red
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to take the emerson of the
plant too hard yeah it looks like it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it looks like there's two types of
photosynthesis yeah see there there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: types of photosynthesis photosynthesis one
and photosynthesis two and that that 660
[SPEAKER_00]: red drives the photosynthesis one
extremely hard so what that's why they put
[SPEAKER_00]: that in all the led lights so that they
can pretty much uh fake the plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's getting a right amount of uh
daylight integral hours so they use the
[SPEAKER_00]: red because that red has the ability to
penetrate extremely deeply so what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening now is as it penetrates through
the top of the canopy it adds even more
[SPEAKER_00]: red to the lower canopy because the red is
getting the rest of the spectrum the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the spectrum gets absorbed through all
the fucking canopy and what hits the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom is just red so that plant's seeing
far too much red spectrum with an led
[SPEAKER_00]: light and not enough blue so it's not
because it doesn't have enough uv which it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't because you can't get enough uv
out of almost any uh uv setup like mine's
[SPEAKER_00]: got that shit in it but i'm using the sun
so there's no way you're putting more uv
[SPEAKER_02]: than me i have the sun i have uh i have
denis's lights i have i have the solar
[SPEAKER_02]: pier flower power light but i just want to
run them you could be doing that too but
[SPEAKER_00]: you only want to run that inside for maybe
one to three hours right you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to run those for the whole 12
hours of light on or you will make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant get sick because it starts the fuck
with the hormones because you got too much
[SPEAKER_00]: uv in the spectrum like the normal amount
of uv in the light spectrum is like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like one percent over the whole dl i so
when you start to put in a 30 watt bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: next to a 300 watt now you've put 10 of
the uv into the room that it should have
[SPEAKER_00]: only had one percent during the peak of
the day right so a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: putting too much in over a long spectrum
and the plant starts to get sick with that
[SPEAKER_02]: light spectrum above it when i ran the
royal spill inside i ran the two hours you
[SPEAKER_02]: know at high high noon during my period
during my life period and then the time
[SPEAKER_02]: turned it off and it and it it worked
really fucking well works good yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: then what else you're seeing is the cherry
pie shorter it's not getting anywhere near
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of that light spectrum that
that bruce banner seeing when it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: close when it's that close to the light
the light actually can't spread the light
[SPEAKER_00]: far enough and it starts to act like a
fucking lens and penetrate it's because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too fucking close that's the problem
with having those bars too close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant the bar is supposed to be up really
high so they can spread their light if you
[SPEAKER_00]: had a single source like a quantum board
the quantum board is not going to act that
[SPEAKER_00]: same way because it can it actually can
start to mix all the light because all the
[SPEAKER_00]: diodes are so close together but the fact
that you have one bar almost six to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: inches from the next bar you have this
giant gap in between where nothing's
[SPEAKER_00]: blending so when you get a plant that
grows real close to that light it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see none of the light from the bar next to
it at that point it just getting saturated
[SPEAKER_00]: with this one spectrum and it gets a light
sickness and that's what that's what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's starting to happen i'm trying to
think you see that with the blurple lights
[SPEAKER_00]: that are too purple they start getting
real real purple stems and they start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all the node structure extremely
cramped and close together it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypal expression of the wrong light
spectrum that's that's the whole issue
[SPEAKER_00]: that that and that goes back to what i
keep saying how do i breed for what light
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb you're going to put in your room and
at what distance i can't do it fuckers
[SPEAKER_02]: like right now i'm breathing outdoors if i
didn't know that my light was too strong
[SPEAKER_04]: or lacking the spectrum if i didn't know
there was an issue with the light let's
[SPEAKER_04]: just say that i would think that you gave
me some fucked up clone that wasn't bruce
[SPEAKER_02]: vander number three you know what i mean
and and then i would be like oh yeah fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: tony blah blah blah but that's not the
case you know yeah because it's because my
[SPEAKER_02]: environment has done that to the plant did
you catch any of that yeah i caught you
[SPEAKER_00]: brother you're 100% right i'm i was just
showing stuff that the plants i just
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you this came from dutch bloom
those are some of his blackwap gold and
[SPEAKER_02]: blackwap fruit he was on this morning i
asked him if he had if he sent any of his
[SPEAKER_00]: gear to you he said he had yeah he sent me
some clones and some seeds plus he wants
[SPEAKER_00]: me to start offering some gear on his site
on the regenerative site so i gotta hit
[SPEAKER_00]: him up but yeah i've got i've got the pie
hoe the blackwap gold the blackwap fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: the catholic girl scout and uh the shesh
cuddler from him he sent me all those i've
[SPEAKER_00]: got those out here and i just showed you
the fire og that i'm i'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing the fire og tonight i'm starting
that tonight the blackwap fruit yeah the
[SPEAKER_00]: blackwap fruit um plus like what i'm doing
here i'm breeding all these plants are out
[SPEAKER_00]: here are going to be done for breeding
outdoors so that i can put full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity high uv light on them the
only thing i can't breathe for here is
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation and cold we don't get either one
of those like like right now it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred it's like 104 right now isn't and
in the shade isn't aren't aren't isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: redding and you aren't you kind of high in
the mountains though i mean elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation i'm at 450 feet i'm at 450 feet
dude yeah redding is slow as fuck i
[SPEAKER_00]: thought you guys were up higher no we are
fucking low and there's places here that
[SPEAKER_00]: are the that are fucking almost sea level
we are fucking uh weird we are fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: like jack i'm at sea level the beach is
like i could hit i could probably hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: golf ball in three shots to the beach damn
we don't got no beaches here but we got
[SPEAKER_02]: lakes like um lake lake shasta how are you
guys dealing with the uh the drought are
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys getting pretty bad out there yeah
every town every town around me already
[SPEAKER_00]: has uh like they've already put out water
restrictions twice and we just started the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer we're fucked like there's a creek
here that's almost dry and it almost has
[SPEAKER_00]: never dried up i look forward other
drought like bad 200 212 feet from the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the uh the lake wow that's yeah they
better get that
[SPEAKER_00]: dude we're fucked here like if you don't
live in my little town you literally have
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop watering you you can't water your
plants you can't wash your cars you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: do jack shit i have a well so i can do
whatever the fuck i want but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that i do but like this is the
smallest garden i've had in a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: like i usually have like 50 pots filled
out here and i i think i got 15 of them
[SPEAKER_04]: now you know being from from where i'm
from like a shortage of water just seems
[SPEAKER_00]: so unfathomable we're bad and i live on an
aquifer like underneath me if you go like
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 feet below where i'm at right now we
we're on one of the largest aquifers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of california there's no fucking
water here man you can't access it like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to drill a drill like a
well like 800 feet to get to water right
[SPEAKER_00]: now maybe even farther than that and the
cost on doing that is insane to fucking to
[SPEAKER_00]: drill it and to get a pump that can pump
water that fucking high i mean it's crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm gonna end up with shitty water right
now too because of the way the water
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting the water table is right now it's
just filled with junk if you don't go deep
[SPEAKER_00]: enough yeah that's my brother he built a
house on the same piece of property i'm at
[SPEAKER_00]: it's literally maybe six hundred feet from
where i'm at the other house i'm on 13
[SPEAKER_00]: acres he put in a well about 30 years
after my will was put in and because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the price of drilling a well super deep he
only went a certain level and the water at
[SPEAKER_00]: his house it sucks fucking ass and i got
water i could bottle and sell to people
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fucking crazy crazy our other
property had artesian wells but i so we
[SPEAKER_00]: sold that place man well like i can hit my
brother's house with a golf ball i can hit
[SPEAKER_00]: a golf ball from my backyard to my
brother's house and he's got water you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't drink and i got water i could sell i
have i have i fired him into my uh my
[SPEAKER_00]: nephew sandbox when he was little i used
to fire him into the and that's like two
[SPEAKER_00]: feet from his window on his back of his
house and shit my brother's like what the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck dude how far can you hit a ball
that's when i used to be able to almost
[SPEAKER_00]: get like 420 yards i could crank a ball
back in the day did i i used to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: swing uh my swing speed was 190 190
brother i'm serious homie if you had
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten around a circle a couple times you
probably could have taken off like mary
[SPEAKER_00]: bobbins bro i i snapped off fucking i've
snapped seven irons all right mazuno two
[SPEAKER_00]: or flex shafts i backswing the heads have
flown off the head snap the graphite
[SPEAKER_01]: you're one of you're one snap the graphite
you're one of the stoppers i'm talking no
[SPEAKER_00]: dude i got a full swing homie full swing
i'm serious nope i don't stop at all bro
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got a full fucking swing i'm telling
you man i i had the fucking pro because i
[SPEAKER_00]: used to work at the golf shop the pro was
tripping on me dude and then one day i
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled out my phd's and on the downswing
right before the ball i hit the ball the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking shaft snapped middle of the shaft
and flew like 125 fucking yards down the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing he's like what the fuck he's like
dude those are two those are two or shafts
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm like bro that's not the first one i'm
like this is my third set of clubs i've
[SPEAKER_00]: went through because i keep snapping off
the long irons dude i like i don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck i'm supposed to do it's like
slow your swing down bro i'm like build
[SPEAKER_00]: better clubs fucker you tiger wood clubs
don't break shit dude i dude i could crush
[SPEAKER_00]: them bro i could crush the ball i could
putt and i could drive but i could hit
[SPEAKER_04]: irons you take it easy brother take it
easy much love man for popping on and
[SPEAKER_04]: thank you for talking with me and everyone
else that's joined throughout just about
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah respect you know these plans and like
the differences you know that that occur
[SPEAKER_04]: between environments and places and it's
it's important so i appreciate you thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you brother thanks for letting me have
come on man yeah man have a great time you
[SPEAKER_02]: take it easy man take it easy with the
family brother to everyone else yeah you
[SPEAKER_02]: too buddy and to everyone else thanks for
watching um we'll see you again peace out
[SPEAKER_05]: you you you you you you you you you you
you you
