[SPEAKER_01]: I first wanted to start out by letting all
the viewers know about bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to test bricks with a refractometer
at home and what I would do is I would
[SPEAKER_01]: viscerate all of the plant material and
then I would squeeze, usually using
[SPEAKER_01]: something like a garlic press,
the juice onto the refractometer to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, something that I advocated and I had
also, before I knew a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, hey, if you can, because the
information out there was that if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get your bricks percentage above a certain
percent, that plant sucking insects would
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer see your plant as a food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we know that this is actually an
incorrect mode of thinking and an
[SPEAKER_01]: incorrect approach to the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bricks is just a sum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sum of X plus Y equals Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you understand what you're
adding up to create the sum, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to make a statement to say if
your sum, if your brick X equals a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: number, that it equals healthy plants or
decreased pests if you don't know your
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, if you don't know what's
making up those bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, same with total nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your total nitrogen number and
go, wow, I've got some really great total
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is in your total nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's just a sum.
[SPEAKER_00]: X plus Y equals Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total nitrogen is the Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes up, if it's just mainly all
nitrate that's not being broken down and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the main ingredient in your total
nitrogen, then no, your total nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: number is not good even if it's falling
into the adequate, you know, category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back at brick, you know,
there's a lot of things that can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: your bricks to give it that high bricks,
but the number does not account for or
[SPEAKER_00]: equate healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, chloride and cannabis is
a chloride accumulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does a great job of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good at accumulating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have significantly high chloride,
that can increase your bricks and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: will have a high bricks number,
but that doesn't necessarily mean you have
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants or they're going to be
decreasing pests, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that is a accumulatory,
right, is if you were to look at your
[SPEAKER_00]: cation exchange, if you just looked at the
number and not looked at the cations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the positively charged elements that make
up the cation exchange, that number means
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could have a ton of potassium
equating your cation exchange and then
[SPEAKER_00]: what does that do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: That does nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just looking at your cation
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to look at all the cations in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another sum number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when people equate bricks,
brick has the same definition,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter if you're looking at,
say, grapes, like a berry, like a grape,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're looking at leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soluble solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the definition doesn't change,
but what you're measuring does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in grapes, most of your soluble solids
when measuring bricks is sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when measuring leaves, that's a
completely different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a growing photosynthetic part of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be sugars in there,
of course, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a ton of other things in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that brings me to the refractometer
for people who are trying to get bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers at home using an instrument that's
usually meant for alcohol to measure the
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks levels to see the potential of
what's convertible into another compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you miscerate leaf material,
you're not getting just what is available
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as what's in the plant,
which would be what substances that would
[SPEAKER_01]: occur in the phloem and xylem of the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting all of the vacuole fluids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting all the fluid that's
encapsulated in cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you're also getting things that have
already been complexed and stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those are broken down via,
you know, emaceration, you get all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, when you're squeezing this green
pigmented liquid onto a refractometer to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to take bricks reading, what you're
essentially doing is you're getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: collective sum of everything that's in
that tissue potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't determine what it is that
way, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't determine what... You can't
separate out... It's not a true bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: reading because a lot of the stuff that
would be considered bricks, like sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: content or the nutritional content,
is there's so much more in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much contaminants in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it doesn't even equate to an accurate
piece of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I am going to do a little plug for
New Age here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly why in SAP analysis you do
bricks and sugar, to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what part of the bricks
is the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if your sugar is too low, what is
making your bricks high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are your bricks high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's go and look at the nutrients
that are out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why SAP analysis is so helpful in
looking at especially bricks and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what are the ingredients of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you measuring?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're measuring a whole bunch of
chloride, you probably want to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're measuring sodium, you're
probably measuring potassium, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in ground and you've identified
your water and your aluminum is off the
[SPEAKER_00]: chart, you probably want to know that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of things,
like you just said, when you're measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf, that you're throwing in a type
of ingredients that are definitely not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit, that wouldn't be found in the
fruit or at very, very low quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same definition, absolutely the
same definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means different things when you're
measuring different parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't equate bricks if you
were measuring roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can squeeze roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can squeeze berries, but you wouldn't
equate the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're completely different parts of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to make a data set for that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to back up and say, you can still
use a refractometer because it's a data
[SPEAKER_01]: point, but you need to understand how to
apply that data point because that data
[SPEAKER_01]: point isn't going to be the same as what
you would do with a bricks analysis from
[SPEAKER_01]: New Age Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a different data set
that's not going to necessarily correlate
[SPEAKER_01]: to what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be able to use that for your own
baseline if you're creating a data set
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're creating a standard across
the board and you use that in conjunction
[SPEAKER_01]: with these other data points, then you
have an applicable resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're using it to say,
hey, my plants are going to be immune to
[SPEAKER_01]: pest pressure, if I get a reading on a
meter, like you said, because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what's in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the SAP analysis for me is so
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we've talked about
in the past is what you just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bricks versus the total sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know that if this much of the
sugar content is the bricks, then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that the rest of that percentage is going
to be the mineral content, the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have really high potassium,
high nitrogen, high chloride, high sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going into the bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other part of the bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are using a refractometer at
home, you need to use the same source of
[SPEAKER_00]: light every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it inside and some of it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: All needs to be inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose a time of day, so it's roughly the
same lighting if you are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be outside,
do it on a sunny day and a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do it in the same type of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one thing about the science is
you have to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have variables while you're
collecting data, those variables can
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially change your outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are collecting leaves and you're an
outdoor grower, collect all your leaves on
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunny side or all of them on the shady
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't do one or the other because you
really want to understand how your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sap analysis, it's all on the sunny
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes plants, cannabis plants,
can get very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are collecting and you're doing
it at home or in your greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: or somewhere, consistency, I just can't
even tell you is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be watering every other
day, then take your leaves and take your
[SPEAKER_00]: samples either before or after your water
and always do it in that manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always take it in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always apply the same pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be using a garlic
press, don't have all of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: work for you try to use it on a sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a different day, have one or two people
or do it yourself and try to maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put a cardboard or something in it
that you can try to monitor the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you going to break the vacuoles
every time or are you not going to break
[SPEAKER_00]: the vacuoles every time?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different things to
think about when you are collecting your
[SPEAKER_00]: own data that come into play, even just
collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're talking about having
high bricks on a SAP analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know that bricks levels change
throughout the day, depending on what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's more light, less light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting has a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental factors like temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also what's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at a SAP analysis
and we're looking at bricks versus total
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars and then the nutrition,
what is one of the things that we should
[SPEAKER_01]: always be mindful of when it comes to
sugar content versus bricks levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a SAP analysis and you've taken a
young, fully developed photosynthetic leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: and an old yet viable leaf, your young and
old leaf pairing, your sugar should always
[SPEAKER_00]: be equal to, but really higher in the new
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is not the case, there's a
photosynthetic problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your sugars are lower in the new
leaves, which means they're higher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: old and you have a high bricks,
that means your photosynthetic broken
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere and your bricks are being made
up of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that type of situation where
you're seeing... Happens a lot quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I wanted to touch on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you see this type of
interaction taking place, you can go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain mode of thinking and say,
okay, well, something's not
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we lacking photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go to the... My immediate
thinking is going to the first five
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we look at those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at those first and we say,
okay, how does our nitrogen look?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the nitrogen simulation going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have things like molybdenum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they completely gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at molybdenum on the test
too, because I think that's another
[SPEAKER_01]: indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have high molybdenum, it means that
there's a gap in the metabolic process and
[SPEAKER_01]: the enzymatic process that's happening
with the reduction of nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium into nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the iron, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's another photosynthetic
chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium to make chlorophylls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're low on mag, you can just stop
the train right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for nitrogen equals a chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that's played.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are missing your mag and you
have a whole bunch of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be related to that
nitrogen to cycle through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that's very hard too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what happens on the SAP test is
you see that nitrogen go higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It builds up because it's not able to
convert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the nitrate or ammonium go
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we're looking at the total
nitrogen, that could be amino acids and
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrogen complexes that are stored
inside of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that has a nitrogen molecule
attached to it shows as total nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we're looking at ammonium
and nitrate, we're looking at ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrate is reduced into ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if those are building up in
tissue and we have a low accumulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: total nitrogen, what do you think that
usually indicates?
[SPEAKER_00]: That indicates that your nitrogen is not
being broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being taken up as nitrate and
ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's not being broken down,
going down the nitrogen reductase pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: into amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you really want is proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that occurs, so magnesium has to
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, then you've figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you also need, what you already said,
you need moly, you need iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron can be rather difficult to get into
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many times that's kind of the main
point, especially in veg, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is creating structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of the iron is used in the
nitrogen reductase pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, you're growing your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have to replenish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're growing and you have great
microbial pathways going on in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're able to take up the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in ground, iron is usually
always there, but it's in the wrong form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually as an iron oxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing with manganese,
which is another I think you say it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the king of micronutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And micronutrients for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are getting adequate iron and
adequate manganese and you're getting them
[SPEAKER_00]: up through your roots and your ground,
it usually means that you have really good
[SPEAKER_00]: soil microbes or you're using a product
that's heavily chelated and it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two ways of getting into...
And iron is really tricky, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: these peat-based modified mixes because of
the fact that when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidation chemistry for iron, it usually
falls into an unavailable state at the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: ranges that we're cultivating these plants
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as it hits moisture or it comes in
contact with oxygen, it oxidizes and so it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes unavailable very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to have, like you said,
something that can chelate the iron and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it in reduced form, or if you can get
a specific set of microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I see though is the
type of microorganisms that you would need
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep iron reduced are reductive
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are usually focolative or
anaerobic organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because what they're doing is they're
able to function in these low or no oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the kind of type of condition
that iron needs to stay in its reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: form to be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, those conditions don't typically
last in these systems because they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: highly aerated and because they don't stay
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a typical field condition where you
have total saturation of soil for a period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time, that stuff does become available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have adequate soil carbon,
you're able to kind of keep that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: chelated form.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humic and fulvic acids, amino
chelation through bacterial secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite production, those all keep iron
in available form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same as manganese, same as things like
phosphate or any of those minerals that
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be in a reduced form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you get more oxygen,
as soon as you get more water starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporate, the soil chemistry completely
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the things that are available in a
reduced form become less available and the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are available in a more
oxidized form become more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because zap analysis tell you that
you're low on iron and manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just fool, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's the grower that needs to figure
out how to get it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we use the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at science, but we have to be
able to figure out how to apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm a big proponent for the humic
and fulvic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that I've been really diving
into is soil carbon as a nutrient that
[SPEAKER_01]: plays an integral role in things like
carbon phosphate clustering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I'm learning about going
down some rabbit holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be going out to Chicago next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be learning some stuff from
somebody who was a private consultant for
[SPEAKER_01]: NASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's gonna show me some interesting
things that I don't think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm seeing from doing some R&D is
soil carbon plays a huge role in keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: things in chemically available forms for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that I'm
wondering is can we use sap analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: can we see, it's not just sap analysis,
can we use soil testing as well to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: better understanding of how the carbon is
affecting the dynamic of the chemistry in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know what you're measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you measure low carbon, high carbon
soils and plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have something to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where the triangle is,
the delta, the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what you're looking for at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got way off topic and we were talking
about bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that is really common is
pest and insect pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the belief is if your plants are at a
certain percentage of bricks, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to be, to give a complete
definitive answer, I think, because bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: as measuring just the sugar content or
bricks measuring the total nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: content, because I know that nitrogen and
the types of nitrogen do play a role in
[SPEAKER_01]: insect sucking pests, what's your take on
the role of both nitrogen and then
[SPEAKER_01]: complexed carbohydrates and sugars that
are stored in the plant and insect
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen a lot of data that
correlates those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing actually a lot of
research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be speaking about that based on the
research I've been doing later on this
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a one size fits all that
everybody likes to have black and white
[SPEAKER_00]: statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, there's a whole gamut of things
that needs to fall in place, which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, nitrogen is not breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in high nitrate and high total N,
or high ammonium, then the nitrate portion
[SPEAKER_00]: animates pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that isn't the number because high
nitrate and high ammonium is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different for everybody because it's based
on the difference compared to your total
[SPEAKER_00]: N.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just throw out a hundred
parts per million of nitrate because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have 2,000 parts per million of total
N, well that's 75% conversion,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a thousand parts per
million of total N, now you're at 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe your plants are older,
maybe they're younger, maybe there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different, maybe you're throwing in all
kinds of curve balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not really a set number that I
can say that if your nitrate is at this
[SPEAKER_00]: number, you're going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to compare it to your total N,
which means every grower is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for sugars, I've been doing quite a
bit of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done one research project on my own
and came up with results, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I will be sharing and I'm looking
into how manganese works into the system
[SPEAKER_00]: about sugar reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking into your different types of
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only high sugar, but what
types of sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So manganese does come into play there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what I have seen that probably
makes the biggest difference is to start
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to plant, plug plants or
you're going to be planting plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, start them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hit them with a whole bunch of
fertilizer as they get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them the nutrients that they need
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the plants that I see have less
bugs, less aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: People did root dips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started right as the plant was
forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had lettuce and I had plugged plants and
I did micronutrient root dips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one set that I did the whole
experiment by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it in triplicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one part of the experiment that
had no aphids that was right next to a
[SPEAKER_00]: multitude of plants that had sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one major difference in all the
sap analysis was manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just manganese, because I
added manganese to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added it to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing that really,
really shined, the plants that got the
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese through the roots that was able
to be chelated and taken up when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were young, those are the plants
that didn't have aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got manganese on their life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was starting early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the plant that shined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were right next to the plants
that were covered in aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way through the whole entire
research, one set of study plants had one
[SPEAKER_00]: to two aphids and mainly zero on plants
right next to that were crawling with
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manganese is magic, I think, the way you
apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't wait until there's a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add it up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you want manganese kind of
throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the benefits of manganese is
that manganese, again, is tricky,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it needs to be in a reduced form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it creates manganese oxides in soil
that are unavailable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also competes with iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things is trying to be able
to get these in adequate quantities inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant can be difficult,
because you're dealing with the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high organic matter actually inhibits
manganese uptake, because it causes
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are beneficial microorganisms,
specifically the bacillus and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhodopsudomonas, which actually can keep
manganese in an available form,
[SPEAKER_01]: can increase the availability of the
manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also what manganese does, too,
is it helps facilitate the uptake of other
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the benefits that you get from
the manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would assume that it's not just the
manganese itself, but some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: properties and the benefits that the
manganese are doing inside of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to help the plant get the other
micronutrients from the soil, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: also going to benefit, because it's going
to increase plant defenses with all those
[SPEAKER_01]: other chemicals that are being taken up,
all those other plant nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't really think, when you ask
that question, what do I think about
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and what needs to be applied to
decrease your pest, I don't think it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, but it's applied early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a deficiency, ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you see a deficiency already,
you've already lost how many?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've lost time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've lost time, and you've lost
sufficiency, as far as the metabolic and
[SPEAKER_01]: the internal processes of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's really difficult to
always be, especially in a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, in agronomic conditions,
it's going to be even more difficult than
[SPEAKER_01]: in these types of modified conditions that
we're operating in cannabis, but still
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the way that chemistry and
biology keep things in available and
[SPEAKER_01]: unavailable forms, and being able to
switch the soil from modes where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be available,
this is going to be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see those pH range, people are like,
oh, this is the perfect pH range,
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is kind of available,
this is more available, and you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get everything you can,
but to get maximum sufficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to go back and forth,
and back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need these types of oxidation and
redox states happening in these mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to figure out how I
can do this artificially.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would nature do this in this
environment that we're creating for this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: That, a lot of times, is going to be
through dropping pH ranges, maybe you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using an organic, using the fulvic and
humic acids, or using biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to drop pH, and then maybe
having something else that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase, using high potassium inputs that
are going to increase the soil pH and make
[SPEAKER_01]: other things more available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adding carbon that's going to be able to
chelate these things naturally and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them in the form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most benefit that we get from
SAP analysis is that it gives so many data
[SPEAKER_01]: points, but it also lets us preemptively
come at a problem, because if we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: something is pulling from a lower portion
of the plant, then we get to address that
[SPEAKER_01]: before it actually shows visual symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the things that a
lot of growers are usually addressing
[SPEAKER_01]: issues as they see them come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see the issue before it's
visually present, then you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigate some of that stress that's going
to be associated with the deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing a deficiency symptom,
your plant is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone through weeks and weeks and
weeks of struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much sugar, how much photosynthesis
potentially have you lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have your greatest genetic
potential, because in this crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about genetics and crossing and
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're deficient in something,
you've lost your greatest genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of showing it, and now you're
just trying to keep pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're trying to look at new
varieties and what they can do and
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, when you're deficient,
you've lost the ceiling at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to reach that highest
genetic potential, because you've brought
[SPEAKER_00]: your ceiling down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really interesting, too,
is we're looking at the testing from a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial standpoint, where you can take
an analysis of a certain cultivar,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you're only increasing the ...
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you're getting an increase as a
percentage in quality and both yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those are both only 2%, but you're
running thousands and thousands of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: that 2% can be a huge, huge difference in
potential income versus what it would cost
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, test, do a collective data sample
of a test testing or a collective leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: sample and send that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest things that I
see, is especially when you start to scale
[SPEAKER_01]: these systems and you want to go bigger
and bigger, you have to have these data
[SPEAKER_01]: sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have these data sets to
maintain quality control, to maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: yield potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are using us, especially also to
decrease their inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of large grows to inputs by 10%
especially, as then skyrocketing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the potassium or phosphorus is
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have growers that are very concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mainstream ag, but still it's
going to trickle down on the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: in fertilizer price last year versus 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're overfeeding, in certain areas,
they want to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have that reduction in 10% so
they can reallocate that budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It normally goes to the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually if you have access, you can stop
applying 10 to 15 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: People reallocate in these two areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reallocate in their micronutrients
first, and then they put more money into
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they're organic, sustainable,
conventional, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the realms that that falls into.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that actually got
me started into organic cultivation was
[SPEAKER_01]: the cost saving benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exponentially increased, especially
when you're doing soil testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated paste, and you're doing sap
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can know, hey, I don't need to
over apply this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my target ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to go over this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a waste of money to add this to the
soil because it's not going to give me any
[SPEAKER_01]: additional input.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I use all dry mineral amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can order things in bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things cost maybe $15 to $35 for 50 pound
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can order them all at once and have a
supply for X amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can add those as we need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes the guessing out of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no guesswork involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hey, I need to add some gypsum
because calcium is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to increase calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to change the percentage of my
cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to increase potassium to make sure
it's above magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much easier when you have the data
sets to decrease those costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with this crop, with so many
varieties out there, it's really good to
[SPEAKER_00]: have your own data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect your own data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect your own strains throughout the
whole entitlement because different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains feed differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has mother plants, very similar to
cannabis, very, very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same exact situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen varieties in a trial plot that
have all the same amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see it's like Christmas
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain rows are lighting up with
deficiencies right next to a row that's
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are things that you want to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have feeds in the same
greenhouse or the same plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want running all over the place
trying to feed very, very different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, different amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I've seen through doing the
SAP analysis, that's the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually look at a specific cultivar's
nutritional needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have a baseline that works
pretty much across the board, but you see
[SPEAKER_01]: that things like phosphate are low,
or that it's still trying to move
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus from the lowest to the top,
or if you see that it's moving nicely,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can, for when it comes to things that
are mobile, even things that are immobile,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can know, I need to add this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs to go higher on this particular
variety across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I see a lot of times is phosphorus
requirement is greater for varieties that
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phosphorus requirements can be
vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing about phosphorus going
back to sugar is that if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough phos, your photosynthetic engine
will be broken at some point along the
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you get really low in phos,
it's very, very hard to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the biggest things that
people don't understand is that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: have a sufficient amount, but as soon as
you run out, it could take weeks for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: get back on track from not having that
adequate supply that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because as soon as your phos runs
low, the plant will start stealing from
[SPEAKER_00]: the older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as that progresses, the lower leaves
get lower and lower and lower in amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your photosynthesis also can start to
shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you add phos, the plant,
what it's going to do, because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile element, it's going to send it to
the new leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the old leaves are still going to
maintain and be low for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant amount of time, depending on
how low you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really going to have a very hard
time catching up in the old leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant keeps sending to the new
leaves, it's very difficult to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many times people can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when your plant goes low in phos,
again, that's the photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then your sugars run low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely not what you want to
have happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the train that you want to be
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a question that came in on the
comments, and it was asking, can low
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus cause purple streaking in the
stems?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low nitrogen, typically number one cause
of purple streaking in stems is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be cation imbalance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the imbalance between
calcium, magnesium, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sodium, too, if you have high sodium and
it's blocking that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, low nitrogen can cause it,
and then low phos can cause it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that you're low nitrogen and
you don't have a water filtration system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually have really high
chlorides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have water filtration,
make sure and check your water filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had multiple people say there's no
way we can have chlorides coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, when's the last time you checked
your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: They went and checked your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that I usually
tell people that they need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I see high chloride on soil and
saturated paste testing, it's bar
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those usually come in through the
water, or they come in through ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis needs chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: All plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a photosynthetic element.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're growing to cultivate and
we're not growing in the wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as your chloride starts to become
not a photosynthetic element anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a toxin, the plants are putting it
down to the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can withstand quite a bit of chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in many cases, chlorides are in like
4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a significant amount of chlorides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your plant will push it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's done pushing, trying to keep
it away from the baby parts, it will push
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that fills up, it goes down
through the roots and out through the root
[SPEAKER_00]: exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is that going to kill your
microbiology?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a domino effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not only that, but chloride is an
anion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will negatively affect the uptake of
other anions, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is so good at accumulating it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the inputs that we have and
the water that we use commercially,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be chloride usually
accessible to the extent of being a toxin
[SPEAKER_00]: 99% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few areas that people are low in
chloride, and that's always fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the door's wide open for them to use
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually most... I'm one of those
fortunate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pretty low chloride, bicarbonate,
and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm able to do things like C90 every
once in a while, which is a dehydrated
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean input that can help increase
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you're one of the awesome that
you're able to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does have a high element of sodium,
but because you have low sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would really caution people that if
you haven't ever taken a test before,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't know your plants,
be careful about adding C90, because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you have even adequate to medium sodium,
that could... I recommend it usually as a
[SPEAKER_01]: foiler application, where you could use it
foilerly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think actually on my directions
for use on the stuff that I saw on my
[SPEAKER_01]: website, it says that you should have a
soil test done to know if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to drench it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually coming up, almost coming up
on an hour here, and I have a podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up, Cheap Homegrown Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we had a question about
defoliation and the effects for acquired
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I've seen is
defoliation is kind of tricky,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of times in cannabis,
we prune up the bottoms, and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mobile nutrients, if you're not adequate
in what's falling into solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant oftentimes will take from the
lowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have no lowers there,
you've pruned everything off, and you
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't addressed the issues that are in
the soil, then it can cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best course of action, and one of
the things that we do at our farm is when
[SPEAKER_01]: we do defoliation, we always add a
micronutrient solution to the soil to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of counterbalance the stress that is going
to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an ideal world, we could do testing
weekly and be able to...
[SPEAKER_01]: But one, it's not cost effective,
and two, it takes time when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping, to doing the lab stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get these snapshots, and we have the
snapshots, and we have to make educated
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions off of what we can do best.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, from my experience, being able to
supply a light mixture, even a full
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, you can do things like a fully
chelated mineral mix using amino
[SPEAKER_01]: chelation, for instance, to add after you
do your defoliation to help decrease the
[SPEAKER_01]: stress load on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because if you're going to be taking
away nutrients via the older leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding it back is obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an obvious solution, and something
that you need to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you're going to defoliate,
you are opening up the plant for quicker
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiencies, basically,
because they pulled away the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand in areas there's need for
it, just be very proactive, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding it back into the soil as fast as
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you coming on the live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to continue working with you and
doing some more step analysis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to let the people that are
watching kind of give them your
[SPEAKER_01]: information where they can find you so
they can follow along on the science that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing as well, and then we'll sign
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Age Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, it's the full, long name,
New Age Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also written up Cannabis Science and
Technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an article in that magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on our LinkedIn, or sorry,
I am on LinkedIn as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on our Instagram as well,
so you can look up that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a few pages long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me know if you have any questions,
and I'll try to get back all these
[SPEAKER_00]: comments and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you're busy going on a
podcast, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on here, and then I'll
probably just upload this video so people
[SPEAKER_01]: can watch it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always good talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
