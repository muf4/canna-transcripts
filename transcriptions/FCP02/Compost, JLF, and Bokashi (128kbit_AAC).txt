[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, these are going to be compost,
JLF, and Bokashi videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: First up, I'll show you my new compost
bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: New meaning they've been scraped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the old compost is put over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all new composting that's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been going on since about November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little visual for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is old compost that's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's loaded with red wigglers and it looks
really pretty, beautiful, dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: just great looking compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd like to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you my JLF's Both of these
are two years old, full of vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, defoliation, mowed grass,
leaves, IMO3 Bokashi, all kinds of inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: I might want to put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loaded with stuff and I'll show you how
much JLF I use when I water my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the back back, I've got a
trash can full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two trash cans full actually,
but one's back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Bokashi that's been fermenting for
four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four months I've never Bokashi'd that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first up is all the new compost
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look in the light, you can probably
see the bugs flying all around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little fungus gnat looking things flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon there will be lots of black soldier
fly larva and they will start to devour
[SPEAKER_00]: all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is new compost that I've started
these bins in about November.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little visual here shows you how many
five gallon buckets it takes to make one
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say about 10 usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a lot of material to make a
little bit of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that, but if you have a five
gallon bucket full of compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is very valuable to a organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see lots of fruits,
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where I've put my Bokashi
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put more Bokashi down on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taco shells, eggs, spent mushroom bags,
root balls, just tons of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever came from our table goes right
into here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here is the compost that is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff's probably nine to 10 months old or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been breaking down for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's red wiggler right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little cold, but just look how dark it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how grainy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's light and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been decomposed by red wigglers and
black soldier fly larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can see the red wiggler right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all down in there, some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually come when it's colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red wigglers like it when it's colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black soldier flies like it when it's
hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is what I use to make a good
IMO-4 with right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at the JLF.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here comes the JLF.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the JLF that I use to water all of
my indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't switch up my JLF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it from the very beginning of
growing indoors back around October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take this long stick right here
and just mash a hole right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then take my cup and dip it out of
that little well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out, all the black soldier flies
along this lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get in so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one I have not messed with at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It froze and blew the lid off,
spewed out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see lots of vegetables,
corn in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now to a five-gallon bucket,
this is what I use to feed my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One quart, two quarts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll measure out at 6.2 on the pH and
perfect for my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi next.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, next up is the Bokashi that has
been fermenting for four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bigger trash can full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't looked at either one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never fermented for four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was simply an experiment that I started
this back at just the end of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got November, December,
January, February.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too cold during those months to
dump it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm gonna open it up, see what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely got a strong ferment smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, I've got another bag down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted y'all to see what it looks
like too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, it's pretty, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't nothing wrong with that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna get it out and get a
better shot for ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well heck, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna open it up more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go, a little bit of
shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often when you Bokashi, you might see
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some mold on the top right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means some air got in there,
that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that nice white bacteria, nothing
wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that little bit
of mold right there, but what I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: is I'm gonna use the top layers right here
for the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna scrape off the top where probably
the air came in contact with it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just creates a little bit of mold,
a little bit of bacteria, whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got a good, strong ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell, I don't think there's anything
wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna dry it on those tables,
but I'm gonna mix this Bokashi with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this nice Acorn IMO 3 and I'm gonna use
this on the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, wanna dump the Bokashi out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells nice, smells like vinegary bread,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that smells really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty, there's the Bokashi all laid
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it'll dry the next five or six
days out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably put a fan on it and keep it
in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the beautiful Bokashi,
wet Bokashi, and Acorn IMO 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: About to set in that bucket and take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have my Bokashi bag that's
loaded with lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of wheat bran, rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my JLF, or sorry, JMS buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna wash that out in there a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to get a few bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed these the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just yesterday, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be like a little jump, little microbe
jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the bubbles forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now to the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bringing the IMO 3 and wet Bokashi
back to the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna just give it a little covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can test your Bokashi, put it on some
organic matter three days, two days in the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be all high feed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: About like that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi helps a ton with the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps the pests away a little bit,
but definitely helps with the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helps break down all the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the labs that are on all the rice
hulls and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put a little on this compost and
that will take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll all high feed out in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
I'm gonna put a little on this compost and
that will take off.
