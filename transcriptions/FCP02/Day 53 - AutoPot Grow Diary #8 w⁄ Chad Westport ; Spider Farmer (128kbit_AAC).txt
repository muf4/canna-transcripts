[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, Chad Westport here and we
are on day 53 of flower in my auto pot
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and we are getting darn close to the
end and you can probably see that by the
[SPEAKER_00]: looks on some of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are senescing and I have been
checking the trichome heads again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the best measurement of when
to harvest your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everybody's going to have a different
ratio that they prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just generically speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generically speaking, 10% clear,
10% amber, 80% cloudy, that's when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you want to check the trichomes
on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to check them on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves tend to mature faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see more amber on the leaves
than you will the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing that, sometimes when you start
to see a lot of amber on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like to flush, you know it's
probably about time to flush because the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds are going to be maturing soon after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been keeping an eye on these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with the way it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The auto pot grow challenge under the
Spider Farmer SE 5000 light, 480 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives me and my wife plenty of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go in and take a look at these
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kool-Aid man definitely put it on
heavy in the lowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you can see, as it gets to the
upper portions, stacks up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pretty nice coal is on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So close up shot of the Kool-Aid man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Kool-Aid man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the Westport grape juice in the
back of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like I said, on day 53,
these things are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking pretty much done,
but I know another week on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Westport grape juice in the
back of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got our Westport grape juice
up here in the front of the tent as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love the Westport grape juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, even despite the weight of these,
it doesn't need any, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: netting or trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're standing up on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice strong plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really dig these Westport grape juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close up of the Westport grape juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, these Westport grape
juice, they like to get chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things definitely are swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 53.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back here, we have our twin peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, oh, this one is
definitely senescing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a little bit of nutrient issues at
the end, but that's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are nice and plentiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the twin peaks here in the back
of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it kind of all fell forward
into the Kool-Aid man here at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could use a little bit of support,
little bit of netting, but usually it
[SPEAKER_00]: stands its own weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the twin peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a close up of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closer look at one of the twin peak buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have some chunky, frosty,
fragrant buds here to smoke very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at the trichomes again,
I want to let them go probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: another seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's day 53.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally pull things at day 60,
and these are strains that I've run
[SPEAKER_00]: before, so I know they fit that window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I look for in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important when it comes to rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a bunch of 60-day plants,
and then you have a 12-weeker,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that's gonna throw your whole
schedule off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're planning your next run,
think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how long they're gonna run,
and then you can keep that perpetual cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, always be veg and always be
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate you all hanging out
again, following this grow guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one more video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a pre-harvest video and maybe a
harvest video, something on drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please continue to follow me on the
website, ChadWestport.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on Instagram, ChadWestport,
and these grow guides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow series and many other
videos right here on the YouTubers,
[SPEAKER_00]: ChadWestport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until next time, I appreciate you all,
and remember, party on.
One, two, three, four.
Let's
go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
