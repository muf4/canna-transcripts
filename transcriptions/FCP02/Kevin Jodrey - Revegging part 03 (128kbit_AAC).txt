[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, part three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can see that lemon tie,
Larry, Mexican black, how much of this has
[SPEAKER_00]: come back, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully developed, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably got, you know, 10 functional cuts
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ready to be turned into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to show you the different
pacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see how this one came back
so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about that more tropical
influence gives you a more plasticity,
[SPEAKER_00]: better recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come over here, and this is a
skittle to the red lead puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, you know, look at the
flower material just completely breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see we have all this new
material, clonable stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we succeeded here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come over to that cherry pie
Gosney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally we have some material here
that's popped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were to base the recovery off of
this one, then we would, we would have
[SPEAKER_00]: said, hey, this one and this one would
have been excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the pacing on it to where
one is fully ready to give me about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here is just beginning of
maybe, you know, a single scion popping
[SPEAKER_00]: off, but it's just a matter of being
patient with the work and allowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to really dictate its pace of
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what we have is the recovered,
the recovered and the recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope I gave you guys some info on
regrows and about being patient with the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
Thank you.
