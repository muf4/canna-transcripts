[SPEAKER_00]: howdy okay next field notes we're in our
African sativa section now so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: Senegal this is from Senegal this is an
African land race and this and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: October 23rd and this one I would say
these are getting very close to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time we may be harvesting within like five
days or so but I'm really impressed with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Senegal as a potential production
plant because it really actually has very
[SPEAKER_00]: thick chunky colas it actually finished
October 23rd is not a crazy finish time
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah it's not super late nice chunk
and the smell it's just all different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of perfumes and astringent sort of
mothball cleaner smells I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: really sweet smell that one more time yeah
it's like soft but kind of yeah like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner kind of smell with some perfume in
there and then here's the other one from
[SPEAKER_00]: Senegal so we'll take a look at this this
one has very similar just a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe slightly more torpedo spear shape
this one has the more pleasant African
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa sort of grassy actually it very
much smells like this may sound a little
[SPEAKER_00]: weird but if you cut a parsnip or a carrot
but really a parsnip and a fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: astringent parsnip smell that is actually
very that's that's the smell that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off of here a freshly cut raw parsnip
anyway again this could make a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: production actually nice chunky sort of
modern looking colas and it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing up October 23rd so I'd say by
Halloween we'll be harvesting those so
[SPEAKER_00]: very excited to sample so anyway Senegal
cool you
