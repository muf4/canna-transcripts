[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is my worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a mess, but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you my rat problem first,
because that's what I'm concerned about,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you got a tunnel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see that,
this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one right there, and then there
was one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I'm winning the battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, this just happened this winter,
and I haven't had this issue before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am now, and I'm slowly taking care
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here to talk to you about soil,
not rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what falls out the bottom of this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here, it's just, you know,
it's not perfect, but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow some beautiful vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this stuff, and really, I set this up
three years ago, or more, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what time of year it was,
but I'm thinking it was winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be four years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, hey bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I designed this after listening to Coot's
appearance on the Kiss podcast with Tad,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was really inspired by it,
because what he was saying was making a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't do it exactly the way that he
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of, I wanted to make it last for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he does his for about a year,
and then collects all of the stuff out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one, I wanted to never turn a
compost pile again, because that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: this started.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's all rotted out along
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got exposed screws and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this, yeah, I used to have to turn
this damn thing all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just flop it from side to side,
and, you know, you get older, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to do that shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to do this the way Coot was
explaining, and it's worked well so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: until this year with the rat problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's, to show you how, or kind of
tell you how I built it, is there's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a four-foot pile of rock in the
middle of this thing, and then I got these
[SPEAKER_00]: rock wall sides on it, so that it keeps
everything warm in the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that, because these, these worms in
here are above ground, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, yeah, they have survived three
years now, and they're obviously still in
[SPEAKER_00]: there working, because the the pile drops,
even when it's got snow on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rats are in here eating them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically, it was just a four-foot
pile of rock in the middle of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a large pile of rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's probably eight by five,
maybe six, I don't know, I never measured
[SPEAKER_00]: it really, but yeah, I know this is around
eight when I built this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so, yeah, rock's in the middle,
and then I just piled some cow manure that
[SPEAKER_00]: had been sitting around for a while,
cleaned out my chicken coop and the run,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just threw a bunch of yard waste in
here, and it just got it going,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was fired up and cooking right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing, oh yeah, and of course the
worms, I ordered the worms from Uncle Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got several pounds of that,
and I got the night crawlers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: wigglers, threw them in there,
and yeah, they've been rocking ever since,
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing, doing their thing,
and I've been loving the results from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what's coming out of the
bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, smells, amazing too,
I love this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess there's not really much more,
anything else to say about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a worm bin, it's a big worm bin,
and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your day.
Thanks for watching.
