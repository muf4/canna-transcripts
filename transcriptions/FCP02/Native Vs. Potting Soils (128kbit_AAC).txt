[SPEAKER_01]: So native soils and potting soils are
going to be very, very different,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like a mineral soil that's rock-based
or rock and mineral-based is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot different than a peat-based soil,
like something that's organic rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not going to grow things down in
the Sacramento Delta that was a drained
[SPEAKER_01]: organic soil the same as you are somewhere
outside of that region because the
[SPEAKER_01]: properties are so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding CEC is really important,
but with potting soil and horticulture,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little bit different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're growing in the ground,
you're relying on that soil to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients for you through its organic
matter and through the fertilizers you've
[SPEAKER_01]: added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, it's not as easy to just
add a little bit more, do a little liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: feed, do a little top dress that is in
more of a horticultural style system where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in pots or raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take advantage of that potting
soil and do that, dole out a little bit at
[SPEAKER_01]: a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you guys were saying earlier,
looking at plants, seeing what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, where are they yellowing,
how are they yellowing, what's happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then looking at your soil test and
being like, oh, well, I'm seeing this
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing because I'm short in this or
I've got too much of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be much, much more, I guess,
direct in your feeding in a potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it was developed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can get high yields in shorter
turnarounds because you're not waiting for
[SPEAKER_01]: things to warm up the same or you're not
waiting for other processes in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral soil that are going to be slower
than in a potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to kind of, you know,
directly target your nutrient provision in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lower CEC soil that maybe you wouldn't
have the capability of in a higher CEC
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's all of it stored, you don't
have that same kind of micromanagement
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of the specific nutrient
management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still do that same sort of thing
in a high CEC soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to be a lot more forgiving
than in that low CEC soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to have to, no matter
what, dole things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that's not the most
appropriate or the easiest or most
[SPEAKER_01]: economic way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, depending on what you're growing,
cannabis or any other thing, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: height of the plant and the density of the
planting causes problems with that in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't really have that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the space usually, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the potting media was created to be
able to feed and drain and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hydroponic and the horticultural media
was intended to drain and not hold onto a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then native mineral soils amended in
this like super soil concept that people
[SPEAKER_02]: are talking about turning potting media
into super soil is like, because like your
[SPEAKER_02]: native mineral soil building that up into
a nice like high CEC, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: forgiving buffered type of soil,
that's kind of the gift that keeps on
[SPEAKER_02]: giving longer cycle, put your amendments
in and let them break down over time with
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we talk about blending the
agriculture and horticultural concept as
[SPEAKER_02]: you're taking something that's supposed to
be, you know, a feed and drain and rinse
[SPEAKER_02]: out quickly concept with a soil building,
you know, concept and then you're mixing
[SPEAKER_02]: them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're like, you know,
trying to wrap our heads around what that
[SPEAKER_02]: means now, because like we understand
potting media, organic versus native
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what about when we mix them and
people come into the lab and we try to
[SPEAKER_02]: gauge like, well, how much mineral soil is
in this potting media?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then they'll tell us a story and
we're like, is it 80 20?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 70 30?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 50 50?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, you know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, uh, you know,
I dug a trench and then I put some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: original soil in there and then I added it
to the full brim with the, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: you just don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, people think of soil is
like potting media native and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're like, no, we're like a spectrum here
in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you bought that potting media
20 years ago or last year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that ties into what Royal gold
does is we wonder what media was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're using a lot of the
traditional soils or traditional soil
[SPEAKER_00]: building materials, these are all
cellulose based products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're breaking down quickly into
a smaller and smaller pieces and being
[SPEAKER_00]: digested by bacteria way more effectively
where at Royal gold, we're building out of
[SPEAKER_00]: like high lignin organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to last in theory,
it's going to last longer and build fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: more effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only are you asking when did you
put what in, but what was what you put in
[SPEAKER_00]: made of?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the, you know, the chemistry or
the actual, you know, structures of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever matrix we're growing in is super
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such different chemistry going on
with lignin versus cellulose materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such different chemistry happening
between peat and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such different chemistry happening
between like mineral soils and organic
[SPEAKER_03]: based potting medias or whatever,
like totally apples and oranges.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like structure, structure is another
one that really, it interests me that we
[SPEAKER_03]: take these organic materials and we farm
them and we call them super soils and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're building structure and we're
building all these things that like native
[SPEAKER_03]: soil inherently has structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they've got root systems and
there are earthworms and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: aeration and movement of fine or particles
coming through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's all this stuff happening that
affects the way water drains and how the
[SPEAKER_03]: structure, you know, so it's not just the
chemical properties of the soil that are
[SPEAKER_03]: so different between native and potting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also the physical structure of like,
we create all the structure by sticking,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whatever we're going to stick in
there to aerate it perlite or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, lava, pumice, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the same way that really nature is
doing it where you look at like the
[SPEAKER_00]: successional level of plants that are
growing in an area and how that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil biology and chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can have basically identical
soil makings, but then you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: historical meadowland that's all low
successional plants and it's all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bacteria driven soil,
lots of weeds, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it borders right into a forest
land that has all of these lignin rich old
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, you know, conifer contributing to
the soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at the biological diversity
and how the nutrients move in these nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: identical, like you said, you can spit to
a different soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does that tie in as well to modern
day soil building?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something to say about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, first of all, it's interesting
that like with agriculture, we're always
[SPEAKER_02]: destroying the soil structure by tilling
up the soil, but we want to build soil
[SPEAKER_02]: structure because it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with potting media, it's an
artificial structure, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were like fluffing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're creating a fluffness, which is in
lieu of an actual texture of a native
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral soil over geologic time has
created.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual structure, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So riddle me this, in order to develop
structure in a potting media, you first
[SPEAKER_02]: have to destroy the structure that you
built, which is the fluff, which compacts
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you add the biology and then that
ties the morsels together, which then
[SPEAKER_02]: creates structure, which then would be
closer to a histisol, which is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, more of your potting media
that's been farmed and re farmed for 20,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're kind of making your own
histisol, structure full living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So super soils, I don't think is something
that is created today and put in a bag and
[SPEAKER_02]: sold to people, unless I might have a
different definition of super soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think of it as a developed over
time, whether it's organic or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: it still has to take time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to take geologic time
because, and that's the other thing that-
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got practices that speed this up,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got composting and cover cropping,
all these things that people are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It disempowers people too to say,
you know, how many billions of years it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes to form one inch of topsoil or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, fuck, I'm never going to
get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, can I swear on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to create an inch of
topsoil in my entire, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: however many generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the point, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're destroying it at massive
rates, but we can create it at massive
[SPEAKER_02]: rates too because it's called human
intervention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if humans can intervene in a bad way
and destroy stuff, we could also intervene
[SPEAKER_02]: in a good way and build stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's part of the whole home composting
movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really see us starting to recognize as
a human culture that we can build life or
[SPEAKER_00]: we can destroy life with a lot of our
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same comes to the world of
cannabis, where we're looking to build
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the world of soil building,
where we're looking to build life and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to create a format when we
formulated these soils and started looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the science behind what we put in there
was working and, you know, discovering why
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't maybe know all of it when we
built these soils, but wow, all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things contribute to building a structure
longterm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a world where we are losing topsoil
to erosion faster than it's being created,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's actually soil endangerment and
soil biology endangerment going on all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the planet, this is another way that
I feel like cannabis tying to hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into big ag is going to hopefully
benefit the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: With potting media, it's always
traditionally been meant to just feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never intended to be like a living
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people started digging their
trenches, like you just changed a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: how things work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now you have this exactly pretty
inert medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like it's it was organic,
but it's not really doing much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just providing space for roots,
holding a little bit of water,
[SPEAKER_01]: holding a little bit of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a planting media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not soilless media.
[SPEAKER_01]: But its properties give plants that
jumpstart that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though it's definitely not a
traditional big ag sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of idea of having those trenches
makes a lot of sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got this potting media that stuff
can get growing quick, but it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in contact with the native soil,
which means that it's coming in contact
[SPEAKER_01]: with all of that biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all moving in and out and
transferring nutrients from the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter that will actually break down in
the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because whether it's grass or tree cover
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That organic matter is turning over every
year and feeding the microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that potting media in contact
with the native soil allows it to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: be that gateway and allow that transfer
between the two.
