[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going future Cannabis Project
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobster Fam Farms here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'd like to go through some of my
most recent techniques and methods to be
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid safe while taking cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to start by bleaching any and
all tools I will be using to take
[SPEAKER_02]: cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That includes the scissors, the bottom
trays, the top domes, and even the little
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic containers that I'm going to be
using to put the cubes in and the rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anything you use you want to bleach
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had these scissors soaking in the
bleach for about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got all my equipment and tools
bleached.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken a shower and changed my clothes
so I can be as clean as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time to set up for taking
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got some rock wool cubes today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be handling everything with
plants or with plant fluids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got my preferred rooting mixture
water ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start soaking some cubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: While those are soaking, I'm going to
place in each plastic cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't something I've ever done before
taking cuttings, but thinking about it
[SPEAKER_02]: long and hard is safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like this is another way that the
fluids can pass through each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not doing one genetic from
one plant on a whole tray, this is my
[SPEAKER_02]: preferred technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to bleach these little cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do probably maybe nine per tray,
maybe only six or eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm trying to accomplish here is
making it so that the root base and the
[SPEAKER_02]: fluids passing through will never touch
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to try to give them each
enough space so that the plants themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: don't touch each other if they were from a
different mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cubes are soaked up with the glove hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to plop one in each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after we get those all set up,
next step begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm making my labels for the plants
that I'm going to be taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even this process, I'm going to hold
them all with my left hand with a fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: glove and use the marker with the right
hand, just because these are going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: jammed down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not know how long the fluid would
just live on a piece of plastic and fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one more thing to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got my area stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all my scissors bleached and
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had as many gloves as I can fit on my
paw comfortably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can usually fit about nine or 10 before
I start losing dexterity and circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have about 18 different plants to take
cuttings from today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two rounds of nine gloves will do just
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last thing I'm going to be doing is
putting rooting solution in each of their
[SPEAKER_02]: own individual cups for the 18 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use plastic dixies and bleach
them, but sometimes these little wax paper
[SPEAKER_02]: ones are good in a pinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're quick, they're cheap, and it
doesn't really lead too much of a carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got my rooting solution ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: One for each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm running through today,
I had eight Harlem River hazes from Pif
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I generally like the morphology so
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got humongous leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are narrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are a little broader,
but I like the way they're drawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, I have some Sister Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an Oregon Afghani crossed with a
G13, old school G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ones are from Professor P and Relic
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really digging these ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the super leathery looking
leaves, dark, dark green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this one right here has a serious
issue that doesn't seem to be showing
[SPEAKER_02]: itself anywhere else in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got to be a mutation or something
genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone out in the community who can give
me a little clarity on this, it seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's directly one half of this leaf,
directly these two halves of these leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: blades.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go bro science and try to
diagnose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone out there knows better than me,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have four of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I have these two that I'm very
excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are Oregon Afghani crossed with the
cheese mill, the cheese back cross mill
[SPEAKER_02]: that Professor P messes with.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ones, again, have super,
super dark green, leathery leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: squat growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really, really stoked to see what
comes out of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only have a couple, so it's kind of a
gamble, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of gambles, I have three of the
Holy Communion crossed to a Wilson by a
[SPEAKER_02]: mortal hashery, who I don't think he would
call himself a breeder, but he made some
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found their way into my hand and they
got wet the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have four of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one I don't think I'm going to take a
cutting off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like the growth of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got these three that I'm going to
take cuttings off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's super, super lanky.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's got some broader, darker
leaves, a little more closer structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the branches aren't going out so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one I kind of like so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping this one's a tasty female.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's on the table today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'm just going to do six plants
per tray on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, this hand is going to be my
scissor hand every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to touch a plant and it's
going to go from, this scissor is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be put down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grab a fresh one every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to not get plant fluid on
this hand regardless, even though ideally
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not touching another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each time I go through a plant,
I rip off a pair of gloves and then that
[SPEAKER_02]: is for the next plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the little cup of rooting solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be just for this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as I've already gone over in a
previous short I did, I like to get at
[SPEAKER_02]: least two cuttings when I'm first starting
so that I can flower one and keep one as a
[SPEAKER_02]: backup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to try to get at least two
off of each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This first one is the Holy Communion
crossed into the Wilson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you what, that sucker looks
covered in grease already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo doggy!
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's fun, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now this plant is going to rest on the
cup that it's going into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, this plant smells good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have two of the Holy Communion
Wilson number ones ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This set of scissors going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I plug those, this pair of gloves
coming off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, these scissors aren't going down
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something I wanted to touch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've been being hyper cautious with
this round of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even pruned the cotyledons or
like the little jammies off yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since I have a pair of gloves and
scissors that correlate with this plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a perfect time to get in there and
prune.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically I would have already pruned
all this stuff off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, just trying to be hyper
cautious this round against this viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a plant shape that I much
prefer, especially when doing a hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: because that doesn't take up as much room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to transpire as much,
maintain it, pretty much just get cuts off
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing to consider that I just
thought of, since I'm doing so many less
[SPEAKER_02]: plants than typical in a tray like this,
the little microclimate in there is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be something to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to take some bigger cuts to
try to fill that area out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever your technique is going to
be, if it gets too dry in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously the cuttings aren't going to be
happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're ever going to do this few
cuts per tray, most people do 50,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 at least, you're going to have to keep
that in consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microclimate is going to be a little
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are soaked for a solid 10 seconds
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the same glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick that sucker right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this same glove.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how this could be a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing reeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now those two plants are going to
take up that little area.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ones are going to get their own
area, even though they're sisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they came from the same, you know,
flower, just in case they're all going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get their own space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard conclusively from anyone
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a 10% pass of the viroid
through seeds, doesn't seem like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really proven yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to assume yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that if I have 18 cuttings in here,
most likely two of them are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: equipped with the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not just keep them all separate and
keep them safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there it's a good way to start
things at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this plant's pruned.
[SPEAKER_02]: This glove off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Onto the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wash, rinse, repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some final thoughts on hoplite and
prevention when taking cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just when taking cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all throughout the entire gardening
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even late stage transmission can lead to
some funky flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been trying to train myself to be
super diligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I like about the garden beds is
that if you do the same genetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: ideally from the same mother plant,
let's assume the plants are clean to
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can only have to use one set of
scissors per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or one pair of scissors per bed,
which is ideal to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not stripping gloves off all the time and
just being able to go at it and not have
[SPEAKER_02]: to worry about all the little hiccups in
between.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really helps me a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some questions I have for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone else knows, I'd love to know
some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long can the viroids survive on
fingertips?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's assume I had dirty practices,
pinching some leaves off of some infected
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long can it live in that fluid on my
fingertips?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long can it live on the plant fluid on
the scissors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say I missed something and the
shared scissors with a plant that I
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't have, but it was like,
you know, let's say in theory,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 days apart, can that fluid still be
living on those scissors?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the expiration date?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how that can correlate to it's like,
let's say I pruned an infected plant two
[SPEAKER_02]: days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got plant fluid on my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last thing I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to a clean garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is like my watering practices and me
touching the bucket and like my hand even
[SPEAKER_02]: touching the water, that's a mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a possible transmission?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, but like, I want these
things to be clearly laid out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I would love to is to see clear,
concise, conclusive evidence if the viroid
[SPEAKER_02]: is being passed by pests or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like then all of these techniques
are for naught.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's just going to be as simple as
having a bug come in, bite one plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: bite another.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard very conflicting views on this
subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to raise the conversation more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not educated enough and you know,
entomology or plant biology to speculate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm assuming it can, you know,
but I want to know how long can that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: fluid survive on a pests, you know,
anthers or, you know, wherever this fluid
[SPEAKER_02]: is smothered in its face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to keep this conversation
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to hear other people's approaches
and techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone sees any folly in my approach,
I'd love to hear that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nothing but respect and most love to
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out.
Peace out.
Thank you.
