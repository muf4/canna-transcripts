[SPEAKER_01]: Hello everyone coming at you still live
Royal Grown Radio from the Summer Arts
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022 on the County Line Ranch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're super stoked to be sitting here with
Ted from Kana Country Farm, somebody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: been legacy growing, cultivating,
bringing unique terpenes, unique profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: unique flavors to the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're stoked to sit down and kind of
get a little bit of an insight on what you
[SPEAKER_01]: do, where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally get something to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some activities, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was like going through the Emerald
Cup 2021 with the whole COVID thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like we won second place in Sun Grown
and Breeders Cup and it was like no one
[SPEAKER_00]: knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank God we're out here and we get to
show the trophies and get the herb out to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you mentioned that because we
were at that award ceremony in LA and
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards we're like, I'm not sure who
won what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it though, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't make the best of what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean they had one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So woo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one year that we had just
entered in three blind strains that we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean blind like no one knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just things we've been developing on the
farm for years and we finally decided that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get them out, that we've
gone through our fino hunt and we picked
[SPEAKER_00]: and we made sure these are the ones that
we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had three different strains and
they placed second, 19th, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: missed the top 20 by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of the three strains we were up in
the top 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call that a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having our forbidden fruit,
chedamoya 26, be 15% THC and take second
[SPEAKER_00]: place in the sun grown and the Breeders'
Cup was just like, finally we got over the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC thing and it's really about what it
does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects, the high, how you feel,
the taste, the smell, the look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a piece of paper that says,
yeah, you have THC high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just really good to see that
what we're doing is going in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction and then just having those
strains low in the low THC place high was
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, that was it for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something we talk about often
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely one of those people that
appreciates those mid teens when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to ones are going to be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the next couple of years,
watch maybe these one to ones are really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take off where people are like,
I don't need to get that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get high and get influenced to
do things or get motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way you're going to get
that one to one where it really comes down
[SPEAKER_00]: to where you can profile yourself and you
can find what works good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more science involved now
than when it was just like, here,
[SPEAKER_00]: here, smoke that and see if you like
sativa or indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far past all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those lines are so blurred because there's
sativas that are uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just like it was where everybody
says sativa is up and indica is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most everything's a hybrid these days
anyway, and they call it an indica or
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa, but really it's so bred both ways
that those true lines aren't really there
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the terpenes play such a role
in combination with the cannabinoid blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all these lesser known and even under
even undiscovered terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you see these big spikes and
they do tests for 25, some tests for 85
[SPEAKER_00]: different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you're not getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a terpene could have this much
of a mark on your graft and then one could
[SPEAKER_00]: have this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to taste that little bit of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they interact with the
cannabis receptors, with the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors in our body, there's just so
much more science that we need to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to push to learn this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it keeps coming back over and over to
that sun grown is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as somebody who is an
indoor grower for most of my life,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that loud, fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the science is proving what we've
known up here for a very long time is that
[SPEAKER_01]: that sun growing is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wider profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It affects you in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have, I don't know if I could
say that in just saying it, but having the
[SPEAKER_00]: data behind it and the testing to also
back up my nose, which tells me what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really come a long ways to
where we're just, we're really getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nose, that fresh, that turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sparked something in me that I remember
when you stopped by the booth or we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to think Emocop or Hall of
Flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since that moment, I've been wanting
to get an opportunity to speak with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dropped a jar of this on me and you
were like, yo, take this home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, okay, wait, but I want to
talk more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were both going different
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we didn't even really meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just were like, we'll catch up with
you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first opportunity since
then that we've gotten to connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, tell us a little bit
about this genetic because it absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: floored me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Forbidden Fruit Cherimoya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Forbidden Fruit Cherimoya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a black on black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it'll turn black only when it
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is really almost a lime green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as it starts to pod out,
the pods are black from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're that dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get darker necessarily unless
it's like a really awesome cold snap at
[SPEAKER_00]: the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is what it's going to look like
in 100 degree weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need the cold snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any color that's naturally
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming into the camera, Emily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Emily, our fantastic visual
coordinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me drool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you at home can really get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cross is a Cherimoya Forbidden
Fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Cherimoya version of it,
the end of it is, is basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really good friend of mine who helped
me breed all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this lineage of this plant that he
had taken from Humboldt to Maui and mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: in things like Princess Bob and Columbiana
and Chris and headband and like old school
[SPEAKER_00]: granddaddy perfs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been breeding out the greener
portion of it all and getting like the
[SPEAKER_00]: really dark black on black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he crossed that with the
Forbidden Fruit that came up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherimoya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was green and totally dark
purple phenos through the whole thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: every spectrum of it in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this one was the one that my nose,
it brought me back to when I was in high
[SPEAKER_00]: school and my senior year I was working
for my girlfriend's dad in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, out in summer, growing some
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that smell I smell that I
remembered smelling back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this Indica Burmese that he
was, he had his cross up and it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like train wreck, just grew big buds,
purple on the stock as well as green and
[SPEAKER_00]: just had this beautiful ribbon running
down it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the smell I remembered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked totally different growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than what I remember it looking like,
but the nose was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just like the one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked that before it was even done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I'm going to keep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The visual on that, obviously it's a
beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_02]: The color is just unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nose on that is so intricate and
unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that it hits me right in the face
is like nothing I've ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my experience too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, sweet, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like get back to my room and open
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, whoa, this is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a good friend, Jason Kane,
who did the Canna Bibles and he actually
[SPEAKER_01]: is out in Maui.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had this discussion a few times
and doing some judging for the books and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants change when they go to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can take a genetic that you grow
on the mainland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take it to Maui and there's just a
little bit something different and special
[SPEAKER_01]: about the Hawaiian Island 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you can get that tropical like
fruit floral bouquet from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it kind of takes you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like we were saying earlier,
like almost rotten papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're walking through the jungle,
you can smell the papaya trees because
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll drop them and it's like alcoholic
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, this is like almost
spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, a couple more days of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to throw that away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the flavor actually translates
from that flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing we breed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it looks good and smells
good, but then it only tastes okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cut from the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't play that B grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have all three at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you know, it's got to look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to smell good and it's got to
smoke like it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the three basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now you can work on,
well, I want it to yield or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it resilient or it depends on what
you're breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're breeding for a straight
nose and then we wait until a month after
[SPEAKER_00]: it cures before we pull it out and smoke
it and test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have, once we're done,
we still have tons of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to go through and I know we
have to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go through, but we have 25 phenos in
one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to smoke all of those and we
did five strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's a lot of smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's not just like smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Critical analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying attention to everything
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ran into some strains from the 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy had to get cut from the team just
cause I ran out of room to hold genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were like not the tastiest,
didn't have the osmine, but I smoked 20
[SPEAKER_00]: joints that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like the 19th, 20th joint I
smoked and it opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opened up my lungs like I had never
experienced before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, was the smoke wasn't
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't even feel like smoke in my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I already feel like you
have oxygen in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like something I want to hunt in it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have seeds to go through and find
that strain, but this is a medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, it's got, if you add water to it,
it bleeds out like wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were smoking a joint, my buddy's boat
fishing and you know, it's windy and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: a plate and it's messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind blows it back in the cabin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're walking back and forth
catching fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing we looked down at,
it's bleeding purple throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: floor of the boat where every little speck
hit just from the salt water mixing with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and did some tests at home on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my own and just, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some on my Instagram where I just
broke up some seeds and then I had all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff and I threw some water on it
and poured it through the plate and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just started turning more like wine and
more and more purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just kind of just an amazing
strain that has a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everyone at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: More for me, but for you guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada country farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing just a lifestyle living,
you know, hunting, fishing and growing our
[SPEAKER_00]: own herb next to our fruit trees and our
veggies and raising our family right where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a part every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like our own kids, like we're taking
care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call this a living conversation,
but we also talk about cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: community people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say this is a cultivation focused
podcast and we talk about growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's more than just growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about growing your community,
your family, growing your wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what this event's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proper wellness, the cannabis village and
summer arts coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's a really special time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate this opportunity
to sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not surprised that it happened here
like this naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're three generations deep at Canada
country farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids are really the legacy and they're
the ones that are going to be sitting here
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the next interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I'm on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to take over this part,
but for now it's an honor being here and
[SPEAKER_00]: just loving the vibe here and the roots
and back to the humble living.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is what brought us here is
this market switch has been like a
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmare in one way and an eye opener in
the other of like where we are today and
[SPEAKER_00]: who, where do we want to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we came here in the first
place is that we have community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have great neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have food, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a clean living.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lifestyle that we still live no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just like back to why are
we here anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here because of the people we're
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here because of the atmosphere,
you know, and what it provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you almost couldn't do anything else
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, where do you want to want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is my thought like, okay, this isn't
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what would I do if I didn't
live here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a better place to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, that's not, I think
that's what a lot of us keep coming back
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people leaving for,
you know, different pastures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say greener pastures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say different because the grass is
always greener on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hill, but you know, I think it's very well
said when you were mentioning that it
[SPEAKER_01]: gives you a chance to kind of reevaluate
and reassert where you want to be in life
[SPEAKER_01]: and follow that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you really dedicated to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you really there for certain reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe it's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's who knows, you know,
but it's really comes down to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, it's back to my family and having
that extra time to take to be with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant has always been,
number one for us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a family, we, we just love doing
what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to stop doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to, we want to create,
create great things for, for people to be
[SPEAKER_00]: just blown away at, you know, we got 10
different strains that we're just starting
[SPEAKER_00]: out with now and we're doing all these
crazy inner breeding with them this year
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up with a hundred different
strains out of the 10 that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it that you're not once have
you mentioned or focused on any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: like overhyped strains that everybody's
talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the genetics you're talking about are
relatively unique, relatively unheard of
[SPEAKER_01]: in the grander scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people get stuck on all this hype
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to have what this guy's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to have thing that I saw on the
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just like stick to your guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what's always going to be
hypesters out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really are a conditioned smoker,
you're going to be looking for something
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the, the college kid that
wants to go get drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to go get the cheapest beer you
can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that THC high thing where I'm
going to go in, I'm going to go in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and get the cheapest,
highest THC I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after a while, you're going to get
sick of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to learn about wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to learn about food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to learn about different
kinds of herbs that you want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, you're graduating now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting older, getting more
experience with your cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you want something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always coming up with something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for bringing that uniqueness
because that hype shit comes out of people
[SPEAKER_01]: creating with passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden people start to
discover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I would not be surprised to
hear one of these unique strains being the
[SPEAKER_01]: next hype thing that people are chasing
from all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also like keeping it down home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be like if things do happen
here for us, we would like to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread to our neighbors first and help
support them and then move on from there
[SPEAKER_00]: and try and get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really we're really trying to
hold on to our genetics and not get them
[SPEAKER_00]: out right now just because we think that
having in-house genetics is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good play later on to have, you know,
exclusive genetics that you can't find
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else that's grown in this
terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really trying to keep it in the
community first, but then get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Ted, for coming and
sitting and taking the time with us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a busy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are trying to come over and talk to
you about your herb and you're here
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again from Royal Grown Radio,
live from Summer Arts 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
