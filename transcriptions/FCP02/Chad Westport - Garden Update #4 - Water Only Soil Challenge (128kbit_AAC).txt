[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everybody, Chad Westport here and we
are back for week 4 of the garden update.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've already had kind of a peek
inside, but I want to let you guys know
[SPEAKER_01]: that the light has not moved since last
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good way to judge the growth
over this last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go in and take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, these are being grown under the
Spider Farmer SE5000 light that you see
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a look at the plants and see
what they've done since the last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we should probably look at them last
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, here they are this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woohoo, that one's touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big growth on these ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so again week 4 and you might notice
that we're down to six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is showing their sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two Goji Oji times local skunks both
turned out to be male, so those are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And earlier the two burgers and beers
turned out to be male, so those are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've got left right now are the
Roadkill Skunk times Space Cheese by Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Purple Pineapple from the
Ranch and we've got Kool-Aid Man from Bee
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go in and take a closer look at each
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this girl just exploded up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the Appalachian Supply Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Fat-Leafed Kool-Aid Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, she's looking green.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's looking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: No complaints here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on, we've got the Thin-Leafed
version of the Kool-Aid Man back here from
[SPEAKER_01]: Bee Leaf Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is in the Soham Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got kind of a cool fasciation
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you that real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the stem right there,
how it's extra thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it just kind of comes up and it,
oh, it does its own little split right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, get that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it decided to split.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going into two more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these will be exciting to see how this
one grows out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've noticed too on the Soham you
know, again, it's got a lot of good food
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am getting a little bit of tit
burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, the growth is, you know,
growth is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit of tit burn on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up is the Roadkill Skunk Time Space
Cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the taller Thin-Leaf Fino that I
got from Mr. Toad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is actually starting to bud up
pretty darn early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is in the Soham Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go in a closer look.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's starting to put on some
nice buds, nice and early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting out good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of tops on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, again, this too,
little bit of tit burn, little bit of tit
[SPEAKER_01]: burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the Soham Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see from the growth,
plenty of juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on from the thin one to
the short wide leaf Roadkill Skunk Time
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Cheese from Mr. Toad that I've shown
him and asked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said this is an outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm pretty excited to have an
ancestor genetic popping up in my tent
[SPEAKER_01]: from that Roadkill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk Space Cheese combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go in for a close look and see how
big those leafs are, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a three inch ticker, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm really excited to see what
this one's gonna do for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is sitting in the Kiss
Organics Biochar Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys watched the first update,
I don't think there's any doubt that this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the MVP comeback of the tent so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, looking good, doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoked to see what comes of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right here we've got the Purple
Pineapple from the ranch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this too is in the Kiss Organics
Biochar Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's looking good and green and
lush on this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting to throw out its pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to see how it finishes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go over to its sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, over to the sister right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sister is sitting in the Soham
Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, nice short profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting to throw pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar to the growth of the Kiss
Organics, but this one is in the Soham
[SPEAKER_01]: Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little more profile of this one as
it goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might need to do a little defoliation
down there, but overall she's looking
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice short stout, stocky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so let's recap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I keep saying week four,
but really it's garden update number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the third week of it being in
these seven gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the second, beginning of the
second week of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the time schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know so we can see when and
if these run out of juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also to let you guys kind of know what
stage of flowering they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what kind of results to
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have gotten these a little bit
larger, but ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going back to the Netherlands in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to flip these now so I can cut them
before I leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's recap everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the back here we've got our Kiss
Organics Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Kiss Organics Biochar Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Soham Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soham Living Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the Soham Living Soil in the back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our Appalachian Supply Super Soil in
the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are looking good.
