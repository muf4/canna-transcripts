I can't believe my eyes when I get close
to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said hello and I lost my control in
just one tiny second.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do to me what I've seen in the movies,
but this really happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind explodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel my bones shaking to the beat of
my bleeding heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe my eyes when I get close
to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty I could die.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be close to you, close to you,
close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to you, close to you, close to you.
Close to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: My walls are down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been burned to the ground by the
voice of an angel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say a word before someone gets hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind explodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel my bones shaking to the beat of
my bleeding heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm overload.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know how this goes, but I'm pretty
sure you just made my world stop.
I can't believe my eyes when I get close
to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty I could die.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be close to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're as perfect under the surface,
I don't know what I will do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can't believe my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get close to you, close to you,
close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to you, close to you, close to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to you, close to you, close to you.
