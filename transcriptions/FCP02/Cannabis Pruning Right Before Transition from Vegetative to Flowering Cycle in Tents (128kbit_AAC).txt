[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so today what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna show you how I will prepare this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to move it from veg into flower and
what I mean by prepare is taking off some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lower branches taking off some of
the side shoots and really trying to Send
[SPEAKER_00]: as much energy up to the top of the plant
but also account for the stretch because
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is gonna stretch a lot and I
know some of these lower limbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll never see the light and Nobody
likes trimming larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna take it off We're gonna
send energy up to the top and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid trimming larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So win-win for everybody That is kind of a
simplified answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is a simplified answer to the
overall theme of what we're doing here
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of hormonal interactions
within the plant when you remove leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: when you remove branches Redistribution of
hormones and auxins it causes further
[SPEAKER_00]: growth side branching a lot a lot of
different things But you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: need to concern yourself with that pretty
much This is something that you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do because of lack of light
penetration And again, I probably go a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit heavier because my tent is so
tight I have things butting up against
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and there's not a lot of room
for diffused light to come in from the
[SPEAKER_00]: side But again, I grew this guy Number one
last time and it's super stretched on me
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I'm gonna have about a two or
three times stretch pretty much anything
[SPEAKER_00]: from here below Can be taken off because
after all of this stretches I've got one
[SPEAKER_00]: two three four and five main terminal
shoots on here There's some down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, those are never gonna see the
light once everything else stretches So
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna bring their energy up and No,
larv to trim Alright, let's go in for a
[SPEAKER_00]: closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done just as a visual
reference for everybody is I've attached a
[SPEAKER_00]: twist tie goes along through the plant
here at this level We'll kind of pan down
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it there still at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the bottom of my pot You see that
line that I've drawn we're gonna leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: right there And I'm gonna do a little
chopping All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with the easy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said before I've got my line in here
Everything down is probably gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: because it won't reach the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean I'm gonna chop this
branch off down there There's still plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of it above the line, but this branch good
healthy looking branch plenty of side
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots it's something that's gonna grow
bud and As a new grower one of the harder
[SPEAKER_00]: things to do is to chop something that's
gonna grow bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trust me You don't want the bud from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be larfy very airy
non-desirable is what that means But it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna get enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna take my clippers,
which are sterilized before each plant I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to take it off right at the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh My goodness, it looks naked but that's
okay now I will say if you're like me and
[SPEAKER_00]: you run a perpetual harvest and you don't
Keep mothers, but you do do clones This is
[SPEAKER_00]: a great time to take your clones when
you're cleaning your plants up getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for flower You have lots of these
awesome side shoots these if you cut it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right you strip it down Makes an excellent
clone So this is a great time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, here's another branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never gonna reach when it has the
Proper stretch on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get rid of It there's that big
fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need them get rid of that Okay,
so we run into a situation now where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have Stuff below the line still let's get
closer in on this and you'll see how I
[SPEAKER_00]: approach this and cut them So again,
there's a lot of ways to do this process
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of factors from the amount
of foliation on the plant whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: strip off a lot Of the leaves this plant
not very leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to do that But also the
lights that you're using and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration that the light gets that's
very important for how deep it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through your canopy and I tend to run a
pretty tight setup Like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's not a lot of light coming in
from the sides So I'm gonna clean up this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and I'm just gonna start doing that
now again I've got my line in through here
[SPEAKER_00]: that will give you guys again that visual
reference So when I'm doing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always just kind of cut it can go in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can even take that leaf off I just cut
it and again if you wanted to make a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a great clone right here So
good time to do it, but I do not like
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go pretty heavy I have no mercy for
these lower branches because I know With
[SPEAKER_00]: the stretch that they are just not going
to reach They're not gonna get the right
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is close This thing is actually
the top of it is right at the line I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: rather not I'm gonna just take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Let's send that energy elsewhere this
one big big one, but you know what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: below the line I know it's not gonna reach
and I'm gonna get in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of little ones And this is
you know, again, it's a heartbreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spot that's gonna grow a bud But
it's not gonna be desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take energy away So again
another nice-looking clone if you wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a clone here, this is the time to
take them But yeah, it's just not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: super beneficial to you in the end I must
take this lower stuff off too with the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves kind of clean it up and You know,
I like to do this after I've water and fed
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant I want it to be strong when it's
going through this type of stress The
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, you know, you don't want to take
the entire plant But you can take a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: amount off without causing too much of a
skip in the beat for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I give this maybe Three four
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be right back on pace with
where it was going And I do have another
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk number one same size hasn't been
cleaned out and that is kind of a test So
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see how much this promotes and
stimulates growth and stretching just from
[SPEAKER_00]: redistributing all the stuff that was in
these lower branches So you can see it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit cleaner right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna kind of do a little Turn
around here Oops cutting in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera bad poise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe why don't I just spin this beauty
give it Vanna white style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah All right you right there You're
right at my line one two, three four five
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes away from the top I'm just gonna
take you because I know I'm gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six more nodes by the time we're
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So goodbye Same with you Goodbye And
again, you want to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping it right at the main stem
Sometimes if you don't clip it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right spot, it'll just grow back and
that's not what you want So get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: here you you're so close, but you know
what get out of here You get out of here
[SPEAKER_00]: too everybody make like a tree and leaf
All right one more Again, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to go chop happy because I know how
much this plant can recover and I know how
[SPEAKER_00]: much more new growth it's gonna have That
is looking pretty good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just give you guys a pan up pan
down and you'll see holy crap that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: So much different from what it did before
but you know what it promotes airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great and See, I got my line
right there Everything is hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: above that line Everything below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some lease to help transpire
to help photosynthesize But that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically different landscape than when
we started just a few minutes ago You can
[SPEAKER_00]: see from above she's still a nice healthy
Full-looking plant got lots of lots of bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sites are gonna grow and be nice So we've
got that going for at least and there she
[SPEAKER_00]: is That was my process of getting a plant
ready to go into flower from veg for my
[SPEAKER_00]: tight tent with not a whole bunch of light
penetration because I'm not using a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of wattage in there and that's
fairly common for a home grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: Combined with the known stretch of this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went pretty high But as I said,
you see the line everything below it is
[SPEAKER_00]: clean everything above it once this plant
stretches It should still be getting good
[SPEAKER_00]: light penetration and that's the key to
good buds So thank you for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed the process and please
Send us your tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see your videos and who knows
maybe we'll even play it on the show So
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks guys and I'll see you next time You
You You
