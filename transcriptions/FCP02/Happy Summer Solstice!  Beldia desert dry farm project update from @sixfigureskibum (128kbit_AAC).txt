[SPEAKER_00]: Summer solstice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy summer solstice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a bedleon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the earliest males to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the females are just starting to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left about seven or eight full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a third of the crop I just went
ahead and folded over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then several others I chopped the top
off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are strategies to experiment with
dealing with the extreme drought
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have not received any water here in
Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have not been fed or watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were direct seeded on March 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a male coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing this as a demonstration
project to show people that dry farming
[SPEAKER_00]: actually can occur wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in extraordinary drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these have not been fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having some serious pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to have a really good
medicine crop for my daughter's mother
[SPEAKER_00]: who's dealing with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All natural with true terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is alkali dust from a
small rainstorm we just had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Leighton likes to say that we don't
get bacterial or microbe distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anymore, but it's quite obvious that we do
get quite a bit of windstorm activity that
[SPEAKER_00]: blows surface soil particles and deposits
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it in the snow on the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns all dark because of all of these
soil particles in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyhow, bugs I'm dealing with are the
pill bug, earwigs, grasshopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spinosad is my number one go-to in veg
for these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also am doing pyrethrin flower tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick update for y'all on the bed,
Liam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the males are all, I removed the
majority of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last ones are turning and the females
are just showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's solstice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate y'all for learning how to
change the world with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know these don't look awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is worst case, middle of the fucking
desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get extreme temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These actually just had five days of 30
mile an hour wind, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ripped out branches from my front yard
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were furnace blasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at 97 degrees the first day of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that all for what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never been fed, never been watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extreme desert blasting conditions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not claiming that these are
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not claiming this is the end all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pest right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing you, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put seeds in the ground and produce a
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be spending a million
dollars on a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pounds for pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pounds for pennies.
