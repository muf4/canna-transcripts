[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, hey we're out at our Landrace
Botanical Garden again doing field notes
[SPEAKER_00]: for this very cool Afghan plant and this
particular variety is called Kushkak and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an incredibly unique terpian
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to open it up and smell and
what's so interesting about this one is it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like mesquite smoke at least that's
what I'm picking up it already smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke but really good mesquite smoke kind
of with a cedary almost bug spray kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: smell but it's really intoxicating and
incredibly unique so I'm very excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about this plant and today is October 18th
by the way it's really hot so sorry if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: oozing sweat it's incredibly hot today
surprisingly and but we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest this today so just want to
document it we'll cruise around maybe this
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a good bud to come in on reality
is probably go three four or five days
[SPEAKER_00]: longer but they're really really thick
dense buds and we're getting a lot of wet
[SPEAKER_00]: nights so I'm really a little concerned
and I can only make it out here every few
[SPEAKER_00]: days if I lived here full-time anyway I'd
be able to stay on it a little more but
[SPEAKER_00]: right now they're close enough to harvest
and don't want to see them start imploding
[SPEAKER_00]: or getting a mold so I think we're going
to take it today but bottom line it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really really really cool plant very
excited about it Kushkak yet another each
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan I'm trying to think which ones are
my favorites but to tell you each one is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly cool in its own right and they
all have unique terpenes and this is yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: another one but that mesquite smoke is
probably yeah none of them none of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones smell like this so that's
something really unique about this but oh
[SPEAKER_00]: and then one other thing wanted to show
here's another Kushkak that we already
[SPEAKER_00]: started harvesting so and here you'll see
that starting to purple up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting a little darker at night so
this plant if it were colder at night we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: probably get a lot more of the purple and
black but yeah it's been warmer than usual
[SPEAKER_00]: so everything's kind of green still anyway
great plant that's it you you
