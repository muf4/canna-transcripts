[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everybody, Chad Westport here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with 71DPO and we just want to
give you a quick little update about the
[SPEAKER_00]: show he's been doing lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us where we're at, DP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate everybody's
involvement thus far in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just taken a little bit of time off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get some things situated in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just renewed my lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was planning on moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just once I get things a little bit
more settled down, I'll get the show going
[SPEAKER_01]: back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have somebody coming on the 25th and
that's Mrs. Vicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find her on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a beautiful person in the movement
of psychedelics and she does a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: reintegration and she's very involved in
the laws and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't wait for her to be able to talk
about the movement she's involved with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with like decriminalized nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been excited by the shows that you've
done and it sounds like you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep continuing where you've left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I kind of want to just take a
moment to pause and say big ups to you
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're following the advice that
you give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we need to put, you know,
extra things on pause and get a bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to put my time and
energy into this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And give it the respect it deserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I owe myself the respect I deserve to
get myself back in tip-top, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody's going to argue
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, I do just want to
leave this info up because it can and may
[SPEAKER_00]: help a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the people watching or someone they
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Suicide Prevention Hotline,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day, 365.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach that 1-800 273-8255 and also
NAMI.org, which is the National Alliance
[SPEAKER_00]: of Mental Illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great resources there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the flyer says, keep calm and
I'll be back soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Returning June 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, everybody, while we're here,
I want to give you an update on the shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for the last little over a year,
I've been doing the Perfectly Imperfect
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Show, where we take you inside the
home gardens of our peers, our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm stoked to see it catching on with
a lot of other shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of taken care of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always want to be doing something a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be back every Saturday with a
new show called The Friendly Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starts June 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start it off with Marge
from the Bite Me podcast and Manny from
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud and Lather.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about
alternative uses for junk that we throw
[SPEAKER_00]: away when we trim our plants or even the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many uses for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to cover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I've got some
exciting guests lined up for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people you don't always hear from a
lot of times, but people who you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep it locked here on the Future
Cannabis Project and FCPO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times ahead, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the update, DP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to seeing you then,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
