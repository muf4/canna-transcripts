[SPEAKER_01]: So I buy this property in Potter Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a doozy, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I buy this property in Potter Valley,
and I got this great deal on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's surrounded by National Forest,
it's 40 acres, and three gates to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Oak Gap Road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when you go over the hill and
you just start heading towards the Lake
[SPEAKER_01]: Pillsbury, it's like right there,
you go up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it's got this little cabin on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like half built, pretty close,
but not finished out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got these greenhouses up above,
and it's all National Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh my god, we can grow so much
weed in that National Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Endless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a generator, start up, get all the
plants fucking going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like February, and we're just getting
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just cloning like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're up in the National Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a four-wheeler up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're digging holes, little benches,
and just up there in the rain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and carrying soil up with the
four-wheeler, and carrying it out to all
[SPEAKER_01]: these little patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one day, I got my fiancee,
or maybe she was my wife at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and she was transplanting down in the
greenhouses, and me and my partner and his
[SPEAKER_01]: brother were up there digging holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been raining all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just soaking wet in picks and
shovels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, oh, we get on the
four-wheeler, and we start heading down
[SPEAKER_01]: the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get down to the flat where the
greenhouses are, and the tractor that I
[SPEAKER_01]: got borrowed from my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, this freaking sheriff
in a flak jacket and camo jumps out behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, am I in the four-wheeler?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my partner's like, and his brother
starts to jump off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my partner's like, go, go,
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, the guy's got his gun right
here, and my partner hits his arm up,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the cop grabs onto the back of
the four-wheeler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just start hitting gears.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dragging this sheriff, and we start
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go, and apparently, he held on for
a while, and he let go, and he just starts
[SPEAKER_01]: sliding on his belly, and he starts
flopping over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's all these sheriffs and
stuff over here, and they got a canine
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could see them coming at us,
and they're running towards us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the canine unit, that sheriff
just was flopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the canine guy just grabbed hold
of him and just starts shaking him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went down a little dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, get ready to jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I jumped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize how fast we were going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I jumped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just start eating shit because I can't
run that fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we flopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran up the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sheriffs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fucking wife is down there in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I start turning around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to arrest you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be able to help her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get her belled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I keep hyping up the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom meets me at the little bridge down
there when you go over the hill,
[SPEAKER_01]: little bridge there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mom picks us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mom calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bells are out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, my wife didn't have to dress out
and got her belled out right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went and turned myself in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I learned was, I bought the
property from the biggest meth cooker in
[SPEAKER_01]: frickin' Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name was John Lauder Milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they called it the Lauder Powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had been after this guy for
fucking decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy was like the king.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had people hired in the sheriff's
department that would tell him when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to raid him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, it's going to get dark for
a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cut this if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So John Lauder Milk, I wish I knew it
before about the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably wouldn't have bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were after him so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just could never get him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they framed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got this glassware from Humboldt and
Evidence Room and brought it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they framed him and busted him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at some point, at the same property
during that same time, he had a party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this girl fell down the stairs and
died.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all raging and partying and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ended up burying this girl on the
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on, went and told them,
hey, this was an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And told them where she was, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, so they got him tampering with
dead body or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also framed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he caught them framing him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now he's in court on both these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, the judge is like,
you guys, you two, go figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kid's not going to trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a sheriff framing this drug
dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a drug dealer that buried a body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm reading all this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's the property we fucking
decided to buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, we had the 3,300 plants I got
busted for and ended up going from Oh Gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: 3,300 back in what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of plants from 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason that we kind of got a
good deal is they were on a probation
[SPEAKER_01]: search when they actually came to the
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were looking for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't realize the property sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they cut all the locks without a
warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they kind of had, if we went all
the way to trial, it would have been like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we might've won.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they offered a good deal,
but they also got to put my wife in prison
[SPEAKER_01]: if like we didn't take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took the deal and I did like seven
months in Mendocino County jail,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was on low gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of, I went from Oak Gap to low
gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a quick slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many stories we hear in the cannabis
industry about people who are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just growing cannabis,
getting rung up for the previous tenants
[SPEAKER_02]: of properties who are doing much,
much darker things who managed to skate
[SPEAKER_02]: through it with little or no consequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet then the cannabis growers were the
people who got rung up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I had a similar experience in Humboldt
after you know, somebody was doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong thing on the property and you know,
the cops come two years late and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: can catch somebody growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so this is 94 and personally I'm a
little younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really just starting to get
heavily into cannabis at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the Midwest and 3,300 plants to me
looking back, it's like, wow, we had like
[SPEAKER_02]: seven and we thought we were a big deal in
Michigan, you know, growing it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cornfields with 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's an amazing start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you come out after seven months in
Mendo County, I had a lot of time to plan
[SPEAKER_01]: my next indoor, you know, I was like,
man, you know what, I'm going underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had like living there with that
little short pencil, fucking like drawing
[SPEAKER_01]: out my plants, the underground indoor that
I'm going to build like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, and I'm like, man, I'm kind of blown
out in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're like know me, you know,
so I'm going back to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so what was the scale of that bust
in Mendocino at that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as history goes, was it considered?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big one, but I was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, I was like a kid, like 21 years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved here in 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm asking to see the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kind of, it was one, they were
like, they kind of were culpable on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the pro probation search and then
other like, here's this kid like doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time they were like looking at me
like, this kid doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was kind of like, I think they
put a little mercy on me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, you know, this is like,
let's just get this guy out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's use him a little less and he'll
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's definitely not doing this again.
I don't think he's doing this again.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
