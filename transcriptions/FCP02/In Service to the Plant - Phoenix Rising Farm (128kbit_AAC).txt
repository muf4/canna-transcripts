[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everyone and welcome once again to
Royal Grown Radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so honored and psyched to be out
here today with some very, very dear
[SPEAKER_03]: friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond Friends, we're here with family
today in southern Oregon in the Applegate
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley at Phoenix Rising Farm with a very
dear friend, Casey Branham.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us, Casey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also here with folks from the
Cannabis Conservancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Jeremy Lord here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to walk through the
greenhouses, kind of get the lowdown on
[SPEAKER_03]: this truly sustainable, regenerative farm
right along the river in the Applegate
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try and bring you the
listener here with us with the birds
[SPEAKER_03]: chirping, the river rumbling behind us,
and the most amazing scents and sounds of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and beneficial insects and the
soil food web beneath the canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bear with us on a new journey,
but welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come along.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the coolest things about this farm,
Casey, is these animals and tell us a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit about what's going on with some
of the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the farm, we have eight
alpacas, one llama and three goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, animal husbandry isn't
necessarily my bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate these guys though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so fun and they bring a tremendous
component to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is their poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their manure gives us mulch, tea
components for our compost tea,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a great layer in our fall sheet mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our three non-assisted
light depth greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, plants are grown just right here
in the native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sandy loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an alluvial deposit from the Little
Applegate River.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things about our farm that we
find important is to grow a polyculture
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, which means just a lot of
diversity, plant diversity, mixed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in companionship with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got potatoes, sunflowers,
comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much everywhere on the farm,
you'll see a lot of comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular plant is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we'll cut the leaves and put
them in a barrel and ferment them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll add sugar and make a fermented plant
juice, which we then feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, you know, this stuff just
keeps growing as we water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll chop the leaves, drop them,
and they'll just kind of disintegrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolve and do their thing, nourishing
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some ice cream cake right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about ready, but looking great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those purples on the tips of the calyxes
just really have so much personality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's one of my favorite
characteristics of the ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another real important part of this grow
here in these, these native soil beds is
[SPEAKER_00]: having a really developed soil ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically in a lot of these,
you'll find mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got kingstrophoria growing up under
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the drip lines, you can find
some mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every fall, we'll lay a mulch down of
deciduous leaves collected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: property and from the greater Rogue
Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go and we'll grab a U-Haul truck and
go around and pick up people's bags of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In doing so, we get a really great variety
of deciduous leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stuff that you wouldn't see out here,
you know, sugar maples, all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ornamentals that grow in their
in people's yards in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get all those leaves, bring them
here, let them do their thing and nourish
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll lay down leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll lay down alfalfa hay, which is a
high nitrogen dominant hay, which is grown
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the valley here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do manure from our alpacas,
goats and llama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do, we've also got a dairy farm
just right down here, like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning before, and we'll get some of
their dairy manure as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll kind of cover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a layer of rice straw and just let it
do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year we keep adding to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year we get better and better
results from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll either doing fire remediation around
the property, being in this Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon area, it's hot, it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll cut trees to keep, to give
ourselves some space and we'll chip those
[SPEAKER_00]: trees up and lay down the oak,
madrone, alder, ash, whatever else is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out here, typically hardwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll lay them down too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, just keep building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really makes it, makes it,
you know, produce this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The combination of the like ultra hyper
local off of the property inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the, you know, just a little
footprint further out and out for some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the other inputs that you don't have,
but to bring all this diversity to your
[SPEAKER_03]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're able to have a wider variety of
breakdown times, a wider variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're encouraging different fungal and
micro bacterial or microorganisms to
[SPEAKER_03]: really develop because there's more food
sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more organisms find their own niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy, this is kind of your bread and
butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're here for an inspection,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I was so reluctant to jump
on your radio show is because it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about third party
certification, but that's absolutely what
[SPEAKER_01]: certification is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about rewarding this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's about acknowledging it and
helping to push it further in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so important, I think, to really give
people that are doing this extra work a
[SPEAKER_03]: vehicle to highlight it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these certifications are that vehicle
at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's a big part of what
Rick and I really vibe with on Royal grown
[SPEAKER_03]: radio is being able to help share that
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more people can see it and hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just so near and dear to our
heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wedding Crasher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crasher's right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the upright structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's trellised out nicely to
spread it, but it doesn't look like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really relying on it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a flopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's standing tall and it's just it's
chunked and just gorgeous, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: That structure is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tight, solid flower, really, really
beautiful, not super leafy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a quick, easy trim job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the extract out of there is a
mouthwatering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love listening to you break
down your methods as far as the layering
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, sourcing everything from
from your local environment and your
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were the first person I remember
really, you know, turning me on to
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporating, you know, clover,
planting clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I never attended 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came up and learning that part of,
you know, not only just stabilizing the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature of the soil, but also just
bringing that food back into that cycle.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, living mulch and cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's such a huge part of it,
of adding nutrients to the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: prolonging the soil's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, up here, it's so hot and dry,
you know, and the sun just beats down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having some protective covering is
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just chop it,
drop it, push it right into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It acts as a green manure as much as it
kind of creates a home for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial bugs that are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're getting that nitrogen fixation
as well with plants like clover and peas
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the other legume type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of the aeration aspect of like,
you know, the daikon and some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever bulldozer of cover crops where
they're actually breaking up some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger chunks and creating good airspace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you layer it in, you know,
it breaks down, refills and just what we
[SPEAKER_00]: like about the comfrey too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other plants that we mix
in here is their biodynamic accumulators,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that their roots go really
deep and they pull up nutrients from deep
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you chop and drop their
foliage, you're getting those nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: back up on the top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just pulling from the bottom and
bringing it up to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can, then these plants can
access it closer where they wouldn't be so
[SPEAKER_00]: deep rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a chem cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that you get the chem gas,
but you got that cookie structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that looks like it's got a few weeks
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some time on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That white against those light orange
hairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers are the ultimate multitaskers.
Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
