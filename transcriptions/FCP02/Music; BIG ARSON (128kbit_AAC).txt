[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host, Cienzo Niko, and this week
our guest is Big Arson, also known as
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin Klaus, a local hip-hop artist from
the 818.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Arson has just released his fifth
album at the age of 23 called Keep Going.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gives Cali High a candid look into his
creative process for this album,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is tied in with the inspiration and
support given by his uncles and dad in
[SPEAKER_05]: pursuit of his goals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin tells us how they the theme of Keep
Going is derived from that inspiration and
[SPEAKER_05]: support.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You little motherfucker, you did it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little white boy's fucking song is
banging, J.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have talent, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that fucking shit keep on coming out
of that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Cali High is blessed to be here with
Big Arson today, one more time,
[SPEAKER_05]: also known as Justin Klaus, and Justin,
we go back a ways to trading mixtapes in
[SPEAKER_05]: American literature in my classroom,
and that was our kind of beginning,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the beginning of the journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and you have a new album out called
Keep Going, which is very cool,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so let's talk about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, how you been?
[SPEAKER_04]: Been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been about, what, a year since I've
been here?
[SPEAKER_04]: About a year, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since the last interview, but yeah,
I've been good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been keep going, I guess,
been, you know, still going.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of gigs lately over the last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just trying to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your new album, Keep Going,
is very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the voicemail from Pops,
which is the intro to the album,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so let's talk about the theme a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the theme?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the theme, I guess, where I can start
with that is, I'd say 2020, March 11th,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's when my uncle passed away,
and like a few months before he passed
[SPEAKER_04]: away, which is actually connected to the
last song on the album, which is Razz
[SPEAKER_04]: California Day, it was, well, basically
with that, there's a voicemail,
[SPEAKER_04]: a voice recording at the end, which a few
months before my uncle passed,
[SPEAKER_04]: we were having like a conversation,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have like lots of conversation,
you know, so many conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when I was living by myself,
I was actually a manager of an apartment
[SPEAKER_04]: building and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was living there, it was 2019,
but yeah, we were just chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have like lots of conversations
about hip hop, about, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: life, just so much conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he would just talk to me about,
you know, just a lot of stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, about his life and his journey
through his life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a mentor to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for some reason on that, during that
conversation, it was me and another one of
[SPEAKER_04]: my friends, me, him, another one of my
friends there, we would just kick it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just chill, hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for some reason, I don't know,
I just felt like I had to record that
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, I don't know, it's just like
something was like, you should record
[SPEAKER_04]: this, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So during, you know, I was like,
I pressed record, and then he was just
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about how like his journey,
because growing up, my uncles,
[SPEAKER_04]: they taught me how to rap, and we talked
about that on the last interview,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah, like he was just talking about
like, you know, like he, because he's
[SPEAKER_04]: really good, him and my other uncle
Ricardo, just, we were just growing up,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just freestyle with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would just hang out, you know,
they would just, just rap, we would just
[SPEAKER_04]: rap and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then during, yeah, so during that
conversation, he was just bringing up
[SPEAKER_04]: like, because I think we watched,
we had listened to some of my tracks,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then he was just like, we were
watching other videos online on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he was like, you know, look,
there's a lot of other local people doing
[SPEAKER_04]: it too, and you know, you're doing it
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, back when I was like 18,
you know, because I think I talked to him
[SPEAKER_04]: about like, oh, why don't you rap too?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if he really wanted to, he could,
you know, do something with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then he was just saying like,
you know, if you listen to the voicemail
[SPEAKER_04]: on the last part of the song, the last
song on the album, you could hear how he
[SPEAKER_04]: was just like, you know, I've been like,
I've been, I've done it before here and
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's like, you know, I was at the
studio and with one of my friends,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like, I was about like 18,
but basically he's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's cool, you know, but I don't see
myself going on that journey, like exact
[SPEAKER_04]: quotes from that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, you know, I'm good at any
shit, but he was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see myself going on that journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's like, you're already there,
you know, with all those songs you got and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he was just like, yeah,
you know, it was like something,
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot exactly like exactly what he
says, but he was just like, just,
[SPEAKER_04]: just keep going, just keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had that voice voice recording
for about like a year about I was just
[SPEAKER_04]: working on music, but then it always,
it always popped up in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, keep going, you know,
that like, it kind of kept stayed with me
[SPEAKER_04]: that like that, that message that he left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, just ever since like I kept
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then back to the voicemail,
actually, when my dad, I made a rock song,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's called toxic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, I was like, yeah,
let me, I was like, let me experiment with
[SPEAKER_04]: rock song and shit, recorded it,
put it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my dad, my dad had heard it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he left me a voice, a voice
message, a voicemail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that message, he's like,
you know, that shit's tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got talent.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, just, just keep going at the
end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that was basically like
confirmation, confirmation for the album.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I, I had an, I had an album planned
prior before that, which I didn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I had a few, a few songs worked
on it and stuff, but then I just,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just basically stuck to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as soon as, as soon as I got that
voicemail, it was basically that
[SPEAKER_04]: confirmation, the same, same message,
you know, it was like keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then that's when, you know,
very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, determination don't stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the recipe to keep going?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you mentioned a recipe in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I mean, you know, in life,
there's like ups and downs and shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, but you just, you gotta keep,
gotta keep going basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, it's like people could,
you know, sometimes people try to
[SPEAKER_04]: discourage you and shit, you know,
and then you got people that, you get
[SPEAKER_04]: encouraged and then you get discouraged.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, fuck, you know,
like, you know, I'm not, not, not to be
[SPEAKER_04]: cocky, but I'm pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you know, I know myself that
I'm able to, to keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the vision, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just stick to it as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: No reasoning.
[SPEAKER_05]: The song.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that autobiographical?
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, fuck this piece again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, autobiographical, like you mean as far
as it sounds like a wild, like an episode
[SPEAKER_05]: of going out without too much forethought.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was kind of like, it was kind of,
it was, I wouldn't say cause connected
[SPEAKER_04]: with the pet, the pandemic, but it was
basically like, just like, I might
[SPEAKER_04]: basically, basically you could say that
was like going out again, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I might go out again and then
when I go out, you know, I'm going to fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: shit up, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Get lit, this and that, you know,
et cetera, you know, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's basically, you can say that
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, you know, like that,
if I go out, I'm going to go out again and
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck in the streets, you know,
it could connect to my music too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if, if once I go out,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: I go out, get, get these experiences,
you know, just living my life and then
[SPEAKER_04]: just putting it on my music basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I guess you could say it's odd,
like how you said, how do you avoid the
[SPEAKER_05]: burnout factor in, in being a rapper and
performing these days?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout, what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, you know, the road,
the road tends to put a little pressure on
[SPEAKER_05]: you, but it's also encouraging,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started performing last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say it's been 20, yeah, 2021 is when I
actually like just started performing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I had planned like right before
COVID hit the pandemic and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, damn, I got to start touring.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it gave me kind of like,
I'd say a good enough amount of time to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually like have songs, like where I
have enough songs to perform live.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'd say back then it was just,
so the pandemic kept you from burning out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so basically like, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got, I found a connection with a
guy, a friend of mine named curfew and
[SPEAKER_04]: then he throws these shows called no
excuses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to no excuses and curfew.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then big, big Mike as well,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, like shout out to curfew.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got connected with him through my
friend George, which you met George as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we just pulled up one day,
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was just to see what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like same day I performed like on some
last minute shit, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been performing like about a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, I mean, I just,
we did a few shows, like we went to Texas,
[SPEAKER_04]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the farthest I've been too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty fun, you know, like getting
out there and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said it just staying in like one spot
the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it was a little tiresome,
you know, cause we shit, we drove to
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like first we drove to Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arizona was like six hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we drove to Texas,
that shit was like about like 16 hours,
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, the drive was tiring,
but once you're there, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a, it's like a thrill, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just experiencing new people, people
showing you love from different parts,
[SPEAKER_04]: like seeing like where you, you know,
how people from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_04]: country react to like your music and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we're barely getting
started.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we gotta keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it does, at times it could get
tiresome, but you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's encouraging as well, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's encouraging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like, I never see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never feel it like that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, I'm on for like the
ride, you know, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No burnout.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no burnout folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no burnout.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know what there is,
you know, I just get the strength somehow,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So who have you been listening to lately
for inspiration?
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to so much music lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some good artists right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many good artists coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Party Next Door, one of my favorite
artists.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of great music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of my inspirations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have like a specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, when he asks his
questions, it's like, shit, who do I
[SPEAKER_04]: listen to?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can look through my phone, but it's
just, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't answer that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too many.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went back to some of your influences
who were Kanye and Biggie Smalls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biggie M.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biggie Eminem, as far as like lyricism,
Kanye, as far as like his like
[SPEAKER_04]: creativeness, as far as like he could just
switch it up at any time, you know what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of them, shit, Drake, Kendrick,
there's so many, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: And even just, I think we talked about
this last time too, but as far as like
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone that's, I just, I get inspiration
from different things, but for sure,
[SPEAKER_04]: like from hip hop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say those are like top 10,
top five, Ice Cube, so many.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's doing the beats on this album?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are, there's a few different
producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like certain websites that you
could buy the album.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the beats from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, get the beats from and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few different ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only one that I worked on and my
uncle, my uncle DJ Brawley, as we call
[SPEAKER_04]: him, or Brawley, Braulio, we worked on the
last one was Jackson for my uncle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that track, I had it for, I'd say
about like a year, a year about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just sitting there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we tweaked it a little bit at the
end, like right before putting it out,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that one, that's the one where we had,
we worked on it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like the choice of beats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a few different producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one with some groovy piano.
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts off in the low range of the
piano.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also the one, 405, where you sing is very
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I had 405.
[SPEAKER_05]: On Can't Go Slow, it seems like there's a
few meanings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, honestly, if I'm being honest,
like when I first hear a beat,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like what matters to me the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that beat, it just like, something
about that beat, it's like, when it
[SPEAKER_04]: starts, it sounds kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of, when I first heard it,
it was like, how it starts off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, and then it drops,
it just reminds me of, it kind of reminded
[SPEAKER_04]: me of like a car taking off, like getting
ready to take off, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and then I'd say the meaning as well,
it goes with the concept of the album.
Keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the songs on there, it just kind
of connected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them I meant to connect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And others that kind of just, you know,
connect with the message of keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, when you're going on your
path, you know, you can't go slow and you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't slow down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just gotta take off fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, keep the pace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you gotta, you can't go slow,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: And life's kind of like a race.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with this shit, you feel me?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my favorite song on the album is 405
because of the chorus where you're
[SPEAKER_05]: actually singing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about more singing?
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever thought about, who inspired you
to do the singing and are you going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: more?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, obviously, like I said, I'd say
Drake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drake is a big inspiration, I'd say for a
lot of artists of today, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: because he started, not that he started
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right before him, it was Kanye.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then right after, Kanye started with
the, he dropped the album called 808s and
[SPEAKER_04]: Heartbreaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he switched it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember when that album came
out, like my uncles, my uncle and my dad,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially my dad, he loves Kanye.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's always like Kanye shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then with that album, he switched it
up with like more singing rap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was like 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, they kind of weren't
like fucking with the album too much,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, because it's like different from
just hip hop, hip hop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he switched it up with like
singing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then right after him, you know,
Drake kind of kept that going with the
[SPEAKER_04]: singing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, nowadays, if you listen to like
today's rap and shit, it's like so much
[SPEAKER_04]: singing rap, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I just started getting, I've been
fucking around with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have a voice, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you should keep it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that one, yeah, I'd say Drake,
Kanye, there's so many inspirations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But growing up too as well, my dad has
always bumped not just hip hop,
[SPEAKER_04]: but R&B, old school shit, you know,
like so much shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've always loved R&B as well,
but I'm just getting comfortable with the
[SPEAKER_04]: singing and stuff, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: Clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying what's up with that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up with Clones?
[SPEAKER_04]: That one, I mean, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just so much clones nowadays,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to make the same shit, rap about
the same shit, try to rap the same
[SPEAKER_04]: cadence, the same, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just feel like I'm different,
you know, I'm different, and that's how it
[SPEAKER_04]: should be for most people, you know,
get in your own lane, basically,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and at the time, I don't know if you
know, at the end of it, did you hear that
[SPEAKER_04]: voice recording?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a YouTube clip I found near
the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering where you got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually near the same time I started
recording it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have seen that video, that clip
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or after, but funny enough, it's actually
T-Pain on the clip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you knew that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's like a clip where T-Pain is
streaming live, and then he's just talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about new music and shit, and he's like,
do your own shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too many other rappers sounding
the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's two artists with Baby in
their name.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, do some different music.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I gotta use that,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I put that at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you just got too many clones,
you feel me?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the pain in F what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: F what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like I said earlier, basically,
just too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people that try to discourage you,
or just all those comments and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you get older, as you become a man,
it's kind of like, fuck what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a grown ass man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm keeping it cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to be on no gangster shit
or this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at a certain point, it's like,
fuck what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't give a fuck what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna keep doing me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which kind of fits in the theme.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's just like, yeah,
basically that's, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna still be doing my shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: A line from Mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mission, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get help.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it seems like the song addresses
addiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we find help?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had some people in my family struggle
with addiction and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people that do.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some people that find a way to
beat addiction through going to God or
[SPEAKER_04]: rehab.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just find help is the message.
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be more ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be more ways in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's help out there, but it just
depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, addiction is like, it's like a
big thing for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even myself, like I say on the song.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not been immune to addiction in my
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just with drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different things, but there's so
much addictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, basically that song is
just kind of me saying, we all got our own
[SPEAKER_04]: addictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all got our own convictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point of it, the mission is get
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I say, Jesus rose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus rose.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he got back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_04]: And Easter's coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Sunday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow's Easter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, tomorrow's Easter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy pre-Easter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, happy pre-Easter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, that's the message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get back up, even if you fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all got our problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all got our struggles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great message.
[SPEAKER_05]: Close, featuring Josiah, is a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we talk about the mindset here?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one, I actually wrote that one,
I'd say, I want to say like about a year
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a year or a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember just hearing the beat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote it, wrote it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, I heard her voice on
there, you know, because we worked on a
[SPEAKER_04]: few tracks.
[SPEAKER_04]: She actually just dropped her album.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to her, Josiah777.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can follow her on Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, she actually just dropped her
album.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also on the first song on the
album called Year of the Tiger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys can check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, with that one, as soon as I
started writing and I just heard her...
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said too, the beat is where I kind
of start off with the writing process and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just heard the beat and like,
you know, just kind of... Like I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: really explain it without me singing it
and shit, but it's like...
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got maybe sometimes too,
it's like maybe I mumble something and
[SPEAKER_04]: then it kind of... But then it all
connects with the words eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you fill in the blanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with that one too, I don't know if I
had the idea for the album yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was for sure, I call it Keep Going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it fits in the theme.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it all just... Yeah,
it all kind of connected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just started writing it and then I
saved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we recorded it, what,
like about four or five months ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been having that written since
like a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's the message is,
you know, I'm close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every time I come up with something,
like it could be even... It could feel
[SPEAKER_04]: like a little discouraging or like giving
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every time it feels like I'm closer
and it's like, oh, I'm supposed to be
[SPEAKER_04]: happier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, you know, I do feel
happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, the more shit I put out
and the more people show me love and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just like, you know, yeah,
like, you know, I feel close, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: close every time, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the message of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it gets a little frustrating,
but it feels good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like, start over.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about this a little bit earlier,
but you open and close with words from
[SPEAKER_05]: pops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you close with words from the
uncle.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already kind of talked about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to just, you know, I think
that's a really cool way to show some
[SPEAKER_04]: respect, you know, upcoming gigs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a few, I got a few planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of took a little break,
like about two months just to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: finish working on the album.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I definitely got, I always got my,
you know, my guy, curfew.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always got shows, like everywhere,
even like out of state.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got some stuff planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got to tap in with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's always around the corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let us know and we'll put it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where can our audience find you on
social media?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find me basically every social
media, Instagram, Twitter, even TikTok.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really be on there that much,
but everything big, big underscore arson
[SPEAKER_04]: or big arson.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, every on music,

like music streaming platform.

[SPEAKER_05]: Check back in with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I definitely appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Callie high up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this might sound fucked up,
but at times you're not to think about you
[SPEAKER_03]: because then I remember that I'm going to
have to live without you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's crazy how they done it took
your fucking life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember days when we just used to spin
around the alcohol and I just rather
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking drown in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I think about you, dog,
I cannot stomach this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was five years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember you would bring me chips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Memories so vivid.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can I mistake this shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: This ain't counterfeit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to maintain, but damn, low key I'm out
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You taught me how to spit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You taught me how to rhyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: You taught me how to grind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this little rap of mine, I'ma let it
shine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through these raps and these lyrics,
I'ma let you shine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you showed me I was gifted in one of
a kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also lifted, transcended.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's wings that you've been given.
[SPEAKER_03]: You was a blessing God had gifted.
[SPEAKER_03]: The life you lived was like shit from a
movie scripting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't get to the script of the shit
you've seen as a kid was just way too
[SPEAKER_03]: twisted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It threw a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A kid in and out of prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still through all that, you made a
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still the devil, he was trying to keep
you chained, but you kept pushing anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made it through the struggle, made it
through the rain, through the pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even through the sadness, always smile on
your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I think about you, I take a smile
off my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause then I'm sad cause I will never see
you face to face.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I hear a voice from God saying
you in a better place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I smile knowing that you in a
safer place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You made it through the gates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I gotta thank God that you an
angel stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look up to God, I thank.
You guys paid a couple bars.
Superstar
