[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you wake up, and you feel like you
need a little up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're down and out, and you need to
get a little higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like you need a blessing,
and you feel a little high today,
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome to the Church of Cali High.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali High.
Cali High.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Cali High Episode 63,
Serendipity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, Chenzo meets his new
partner, Molly, and flies to Miami to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick Hirschman, founder of the now world
famous Rick's Café Negril.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, a chance encounter on the Sunset
Strip with two guys sporting dreadlocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: who turned out to be two of the world's
prominent reggae musicians, Steven Catcory
[SPEAKER_00]: and Richard Daly of the band Third World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, a blessed memory of smoking with
Bunny Ruggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the story of a serendipitous chain
of events linked by my time in Jamaica and
[SPEAKER_00]: the threads of that experience weaving the
tapestry of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 63 takes place the year after
Episode 61, Jamaica, and is the third in a
[SPEAKER_00]: new series called A Work in Progress,
A Retrospective of Adventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 63 is dedicated to the memory of
Molly Harper, William Bunny Ruggs Clark,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Rick Hirschman of Rick's Café Negril.
[SPEAKER_00]: After coming home from Jamaica in 1975,
I rented a room in a house in Laurel
[SPEAKER_00]: Canyon, owned by a guy named Ruben,
who had made his fortune as a clothing
[SPEAKER_00]: designer with a small shop on the Sunset
Strip during the 60s, and who now rented
[SPEAKER_00]: out the rooms in his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house was on Little Laurel Canyon
between the Canyon Country Store and Man
[SPEAKER_00]: Olympus Drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two girls and a guy renting
rooms in the house as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the girls was named Molly Harper,
a pretty Midwest girl from Peoria,
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, who had moved to Hollywood in
search of a more cosmopolitan lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: While living at Ruben's, I sold cannabis
to make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly Harper had no job apparently,
but liked to shop and go to auctions,
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibits, and museums.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also liked fine dining.
[SPEAKER_00]: She read voraciously, and while never
having attended college, she was
[SPEAKER_00]: well-educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: She drove a powder blue Volvo and
frequently wore a long black pleated Kenzo
[SPEAKER_00]: dress with gray shoulder straps.
[SPEAKER_00]: She called the Kenzo dress her uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly was fun to hang out with and had a
great sense of style, and was
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable in the fine arts and music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: She turned me on to David Hockney,
Robert Rauschenberg, and George Gershwin.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was 22 and I was 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eventually found out the source of
Molly's money, which had been a well-kept
[SPEAKER_00]: secret and a mystery to the others in
Ruben's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly had collected a bunch of money from
a settlement after being hit by a Cadillac
[SPEAKER_00]: while on her Vespa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact broke her femur and sent her
flying a hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mystery of Molly's money remained
unknown to me, however, until we went into
[SPEAKER_00]: business together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruben's house was a wild affair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruben was an older Argentinian gay man
with a tall young Afro-American lover
[SPEAKER_00]: named Don, who lived in the house with
Ruben.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the weekends, the whole house would go
out to gay bars on Santa Monica Boulevard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as I was interested in Molly,
I would go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wild time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always pretty sure I was the only
straight guy in the club, which didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to matter, and I had a blast with the
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day in late spring of 76, I got a call
from Rick Hirschman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been about a year since we had met
and hung out at his now-famous Rick's Cafe
[SPEAKER_00]: in Negril, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick was now calling from Miami and said
he had good Colombian, and did I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: come to Miami and pick up a load.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while, Molly had been watching my
business and was thinking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership to keep her money from
dwindling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became 50-50 partners, and by that
time, we were also lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I arranged the deal with Rick and bought
two brand new blue Samsonite suitcases,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind with a three-digit combo lock,
took a bunch of cash, and flew to Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick picked me up at the airport and went
back to a house on a canal somewhere in an
[SPEAKER_00]: affluent Miami neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunlight was so bright, tropical and
blue, kind of blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the California sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought 36 pounds of some good B-plus
grade greenish-brown Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the best, but it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid $3.65 per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: The block wasn't too pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds were uniform and intact,
and in fact, they had a pleasant flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and were strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took apart the bale in sections,
sealed them up in black trash bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: and packed them into the two suitcases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick drove me back to the airport,
and I checked my two blue Samsonite
[SPEAKER_00]: suitcases filled with Colombian weed right
at the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those days, there were no X-ray
machines or sniffing dogs, and I picked up
[SPEAKER_00]: the suitcases from the turnstile at LAX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly was waiting with the Volvo,
and we drove back to Loro Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the beginning of my partnership
with Molly, which turned into my first
[SPEAKER_00]: marriage, and at the time of this ride,
our son Eric is 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly is sadly no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold the 36 pounds, and we moved out of
Rubens and rented a house on the corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mount Olympus Drive and Loro Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good thing going.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, soon after moving to the new
house, I went down to get an avocado
[SPEAKER_00]: sandwich at The Source, a health food
restaurant on the Sunset Strip next to
[SPEAKER_00]: Carney's.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those days, it had a big dirt parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in the parking lot, I noticed two
guys about my age with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked them if they were Rastafari and
from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer was yes on both accounts,
and I immediately invited them back to my
[SPEAKER_00]: house to smoke a splee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back at the house, we introduced
ourselves, rolled a few with the Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: from Rick, and smoked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two young Jamaicans were Stephen
Catcory and Richard Daly, guitarist and
[SPEAKER_00]: bass player of the band Third World.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band is still touring today,
and in 2019 released More Work to Be Done,
[SPEAKER_00]: their 21st studio album, which was
nominated for a Grammy and produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: Damian Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know they were musicians,
and after smoking, they asked me if I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to come down to Island Records on
Sunset at Genesee, a few blocks away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to their new album,
which was their first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Island Records was in a Tudor-style
two-story house with a brick foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: and a red tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in, and there were records lining
the wall in a hall, which led to a living
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We walked in and sat down, and Cat pulled
a green album from somewhere, titled Third
[SPEAKER_00]: World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away to have met some cool
guys from Jamaica, and they turned out to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a reggae band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat put the record on the turntable right
there in the comfortable living room of
[SPEAKER_00]: Island Records, and we listened to Third
World's first set of records.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a self-titled album, The Green
Album.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the songs on that album are Brand
New Beggar, Sere Masagana, and Slavery
[SPEAKER_00]: Days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew my mind in a way I wasn't
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right afterwards, I went to Tower on my
way home and bought the album.
[SPEAKER_00]: It quickly became a hit with all my
friends and associates, and I could hardly
[SPEAKER_00]: go anywhere where there wasn't a copy of
that album front and center of everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: record stack, or on the turntable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year, Cat and Richie called me
when they got to town, and I went to see
[SPEAKER_00]: Third World perform at the Starwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a local club down at Crescent
Heights in Santa Monica Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being impressed with the band,
and as a keyboard player, was really
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinated with Michael Ebo Cooper's
reggae-style keyboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first reggae keyboard player I
had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this time, the original lead singer on
their first album, Milton Prilly Hamilton,
[SPEAKER_00]: had been replaced by William Bunny Ruggs
Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day after the show, I helped Richie
buy a miniature TV from Sammy's Camera in
[SPEAKER_00]: Westwood, and later that evening,
the band came over to my apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly and I had moved from the house on
Laurel Canyon after a slightly unfortunate
[SPEAKER_00]: run-in with the cops, and were living in
an apartment up on Rosswood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a little background to this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 77, most of the Colombian herb flow was
shut down by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast Guard off the coast of Florida,
which spawned a cocaine epidemic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the first California seedless was
making its appearance at four times the
[SPEAKER_00]: price of seeded Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds were beautifully multicolored
green, gold, and red, and they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus floral fragrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were stony, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: With times more spare compared to the
Colombian days, I was selling smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts and making less.
[SPEAKER_00]: There I was with a few ounces,
and the band comes in, and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: introduces themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunny Ruggs, the lead singer, asked if he
could roll one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I handed him the bag, and before I knew
it, he had rolled a half-ounce spleef and
[SPEAKER_00]: was lighting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bit my tongue, and we smoked that $100
spleef.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's dollars, that would be $489.70.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the price of cannabis today is so
different, the analogy is flawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I am still honored with the
invaluable memory of smoking with Bunny
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years later, in 2014, I sat with Bunny
Richie and Kat in a motel in Burbank when
[SPEAKER_00]: they came to play reggae night at the
Hollywood Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reminisced and laughed about that
spleef.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few months later, I went to see Third
World Play in Agoura Hills, where they had
[SPEAKER_00]: a new singer, A.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the show was playing, Heather,
Third World's manager, told me Bunny Ruggs
[SPEAKER_00]: had died.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw him before the Bowl show,
he was very sick, unbeknownst to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: R.I.P.
[SPEAKER_00]: William Bunny Ruggs Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get to heaven, we will smoke a
giant spleef.
[SPEAKER_00]: After our deal in Miami, Rick Hirschman
moved up into an apartment building down
[SPEAKER_00]: the street from our apartment on Roscomere
and lived there a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was having hard times with a heroin
problem, as many people were back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I lost touch with him and
haven't been able to track one word of his
[SPEAKER_00]: whereabouts or existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one photo I can find of him
anywhere online, and I have a hunch he is
[SPEAKER_00]: not with us anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: R.I.P.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick, if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to know for certain,
however, if anyone listening knows about
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick's existence or demise, please contact
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have interviewed Richard Daly twice for
Kelly High, episode 7 and 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7 is only audio, but 32 is a Zoom
interview on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, I was about to drive to Ojai to
interview Kat, but was positive for COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: and wasn't able to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get that one soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're out there, somewhere feeling
lonely, you're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_01]: Now welcome to the third world.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: BAM!
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them it's like ages are numbered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third world, no study maths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard Daly and me done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age around a top of tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to now, no boy no play guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bad like Uncle Gat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boris save a pup a son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doris played for Super Gat.
[SPEAKER_01]: How one band so full of talent like the
list just never stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on eruptions, fit like legal and can
sprint a dozen laps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Locker, engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck back a fee a buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give the legend them them props.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real uptown rebels help with reggae on the
map.
[SPEAKER_01]: More money, more problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say a hood a swap, but it's slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're out there, somewhere feeling
lonely, you're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're out there, somewhere feeling
lonely, you're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So come on inside and tell me how you're
feeling.
