[SPEAKER_00]: Back out in the woods, there are a ton of
mushrooms all over this fallen tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some down here with an oyster mushroom
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a mycologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all can always help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some of these big Brack mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this here, it's not turkey tail,
something else, but it's loaded on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom end of the tree with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more of them as they grow out the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some big Bracks on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm gonna grab some of these
mushrooms and just see what eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, nice little spot that I found a
lot of good sponge wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can already see how this has just
totally turned to beautiful, what I call,
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back and get every bit of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole log is sponge wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starts getting hard there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, it's soft right here on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this on the end would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pull this chunk off, see what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, that's all sponge wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super duper soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the beautiful mycelium growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why stump wood is fantabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sponge wood, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out and hunt, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the size of this tree,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes for a long ways, splits at the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of good stuff on a good old
dead log like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big one, first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I'll be coming back out here
for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's great about stumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a crease of it all right here,
what I would call native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this stuff is simply dark,
humic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take that home and I could grow
cannabis in it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could grow anything in that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's so full of humic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff will adjust pH
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add the native soil to your IMO 3s
to make a native soil IMO 4 like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will come back and I'm just gonna
scoop stuff like that out from the cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly broken down wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, large stump.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up top is what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll break up real fast whenever I make
IMO 3 with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is sponge wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sponge because it'll soak up as much
water as a sponge will.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type of material that I could
take back and make bokashi with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bokashi any dry organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so this is one thing we talked
about on Friday Night Live with MI
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficials and at Rover Ducky Isopods.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the leaves are down, there's nothing
in your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spot mushrooms a long ways away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go see what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, these are pretty white ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just totally undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the names of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a basic brach mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I can take these home, shred them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could ferment these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done a fermented extract with
this type of mushroom, but I plan on
[SPEAKER_00]: trying it with a lot of different
mushrooms, lichen, fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: These got really big here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow, look guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fatties there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, found some big fatties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna cut one off to show you how big
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're angled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty nice size right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four holes on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: No gills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see how it's already breaking
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff would give, that would make
really good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll break down to beautiful,
dark soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of stuff I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spongewood again, this might be the
softest spongewood I have found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how thick it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how far deep it goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's completely spongewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hard little core in there I can feel,
but that is all beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take that back and you shred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add some acorns to it, let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have great soil in just a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff you can use in your soil anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here will just turn into just
soil quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinds of cool stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good log.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is called a honey hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tree has actually leaned over a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything falls off right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how big massive chunk is
falling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all spongewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this would be what I would get in this
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the tree fell down,
but all of this is just the broken down
[SPEAKER_00]: log.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at that soil, this is native
soil right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take this back, I could grow in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mother nature's, IMO four,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Native soil, tons of microbiology in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we imitate what mother nature
makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I take it into gasoline alley,
I'm imitating nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature does IMO fours, IMO threes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to go find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nature's IMO four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another massive, massive tree that I can
get right into the middle of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll scoop out everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bark is falling down on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all good stuff to shred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shred that up, you can make bokashi like I
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shred it up using an IMO three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it in IMO four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shred it up and put it in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it with a hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread it out on your no-tills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fongy, loves wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is eating up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what's underneath the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mother nature's IMO four,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how dark that soil is.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little tree with turkey tail, old turkey
tails on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get a little shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're kind of fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the turkey tail fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the back, spore holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are quite old, but I'm going to
gather them all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back to this log.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summertime, fall time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This log has puff balls all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've really released a lot of spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good example of sponge wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get a little squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just beat tons of moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the example of a sponge wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Hi-fi.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: See it dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is right by the river too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting close to my house again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some fun videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunting some turkey tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking out Mother Nature's IMO four,
IMO three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy this view for one moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004 is tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pray the best for all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not underestimate yourselves and do not
overestimate your problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's greatness within you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
Let's do it.
