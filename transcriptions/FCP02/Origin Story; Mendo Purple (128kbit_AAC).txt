[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some strain history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, every week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pick different cuts,
different strains, different lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to chat about rather than
like I've done it in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sort of like by breeders and a much
deeper, wider thing, we're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: them in little segments, little chunks,
little chunks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, Crybaby and I went back
and forth on like where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the best way to say it is this,
okay, is that I want to tell you all that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis history is hard for a few
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is because we were, one is because we
were illegal for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things were in the shadows for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two is that memories are imperfect and
people often disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these stories that we're going
to tell and all these things that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say over the coming months about
these various strains and different things
[SPEAKER_00]: are the information as best we know it for
the best of our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, and it's, so it's an organic
living thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A living document, if you will,
that is very open to people coming out and
[SPEAKER_00]: changing it or adding nuance to it,
or people coming out of the shadows and
[SPEAKER_00]: adding clarification to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things we didn't know about or whatever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we decided to do is,
um, you know, we're going to talk a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about like old Holland and Neville and,
you know, and, and various different seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's sort of like the basis for
all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Crybaby thought that we should
talk about, um, something, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least first that originated with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story of the Mendo P. Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as best I know it even, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to tell you a little
bit about what, what it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, different people that have gotten it,
various pathways it's taken, all that
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the story starts with, um, I was fresh
in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't been here very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was late nineties.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a buddy, a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was a glassblower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And glass blowing was in its infancy
enough that we were just starting to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you fume gold and silver and
heavy metals onto molten glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could kind of be unhealthy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my friend lived in Willets and he,
he, his first, his first grow his first,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, glass blowing shop literally had a
cheap box fan stuck in the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was his, uh, ventilation
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found this old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was a HVAC professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: His whole life was about airflow,
you know, venting, uh, tubes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, hoods, all that different types of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was old and sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hired him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can you come into this garage,
this shop, and can you build us a vent?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he comes in, we paid him, we paid him a
chunk of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, you know, he was, when I moved
here, uh, Mendo was not very economically
[SPEAKER_00]: po it was, it was, it was in a depression
for lack of a better way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of rural poverty and stuff
like that around here.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, and everyone was affected by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was building this thing,
you know, um, various duct work and hoods
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process of talking to him,
I discovered that he had cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that affected me pretty greatly because
at the time my ex, uh, she, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's part of the reason why we moved to
Mendo is that she was undergoing
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo, uh, California had just passed two
15, about a year and some change before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it was the first place in America
that you could have cannabis for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments and not just be seen as like a
total, uh, uh, a total criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt bad for dude and I was doing
relatively well for myself at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up giving him like a quarter
pound of weed and a chunk of hash to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with his nausea with chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't have anything to give me
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He couldn't pay me or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said here, you can have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bonus for helping us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're super thankful.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks later, um, when he's finishing
up the, the ducting and then the putting
[SPEAKER_00]: in of the, the ventilation system or
whatever, he comes back and he's got this
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine medicine canister, um,
that had a couple of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, you know, I used to grow in
the seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he's like, I've got some old seeds
in my closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's all I have for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was super thankful for it,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect much of it, but I,
um, I, uh, I went home and I sprouted them
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatever I got both of them popped and
I was growing them up and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them about two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this sounds kind of dumb,
but I had a, I was growing in bedrooms at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, indoor at least, and I had a friend
come in, I was moving my veg and I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend come in and help me set stuff up
and move stuff around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hung a few lights and we have some
tables and we painted this room and
[SPEAKER_00]: dadada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it all built.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move the plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come in the next day and there's this
big plant that's dead on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the, one of the lights back
then, the hoods were pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were metal and they were kind of
sharpish.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, um, he had missed a stud on
one of the hooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the hooks had come down and
swung and chopped off one of my two Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: P plants at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the, I had a male and a female
and that was the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time I was super pumped that,
um, the, the female didn't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I take this female and I bloom
it out with other stuff that I was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was unbelievably purple and it
smelled wild.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled absolutely wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took this, I got some dried flower of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took it to a homie and I was like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, dude, I didn't even know
I had this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I gave you something totally
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, and he told me the only,
the only, uh, the only story I have to it
[SPEAKER_00]: is he said, this is the only purple weed I
ever grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew this in the summer of 1977 in
Covillo, which is a very remote town in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time this is 1998 ish or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I was 22 and the seeds were 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were about a year younger than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well lucked out and I lucked out
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pure luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I never really got very much more
information from him and sadly he died of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, um, within three or four months of
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so he was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you know, and basically he
lived like, people don't know this about
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo, but like Mendo has a lot of Hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lived on the Northeast side of a
mountain in a cabin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you live on the Northeast side,
you don't really get up and you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really get a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he basically had his little seeds
stored in a cold closet and his little
[SPEAKER_00]: house forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, be that as it may.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the story that I have behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now funnily enough, strangely enough,
so we're growing this stuff out and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrantly purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like nothing else on the,
looks like nothing else on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: smells incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only weakness to it was that it
flowered really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of light in the bag,
you know, like it, like the first month
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing it, you were like,
Oh my God, this is going to be the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding thing in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second month, other things
catch up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up not being all that great a
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty lower on the level of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that actually is one of the components
that makes me think that his story is
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when most stuff in the late
seventies and early eighties was high
[SPEAKER_00]: single digits to low teens THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually really normal for that
era.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of like, you know,
I mean, 14, 15, 16% was like crazy rare
[SPEAKER_00]: potent.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'll tell some cool stories
about it.
What's awesome about THC is the name is
sort of like, you know, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, the, the name has a reward award
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, like, you know how sometimes on
the base of stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get like a calyx that forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes with the Mendo, P that calyx
would be so dark purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see my fingers,
that you could take that calyx and go like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: and there would be like a purple stain on
your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point where we used to joke that we
could make ink out of it or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kept it around, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and four or five years later, three years
later, well probably more like four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five, the purple craze hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Urkel and things that became known
as Purple Urkel, Grandaddy Purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: Grape Ape, Platinum, all these different
things started booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo was part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't as potent as those other things,
so it didn't catch on quite as much and it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't spread as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it turns out, in a nutshell,
is that, and I also think this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ties into the fact that it's probably
really old, right, is that it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one plant that I had, its genetic
diversity is really wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I know, we've seen the S1s,
tons of them, tons of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you grow out, and I've seen,
we've done this in a number of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you grow out like a few hundred S1s,
okay, you will get tall plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: short plants, you'll get plants that are
all green, you'll get plants that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are green, and all the weed is
purple, you'll get weed that's lavender,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get weed that's pitch black,
you'll get weed that's burgundy,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10% of them smell skunky,
probably another 10% maybe, 5%,
[SPEAKER_00]: five to 10, smell cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority, probably 60,
70% have some kind of like incense,
[SPEAKER_00]: floral, nog, champa type, hashish,
aroma that I can't, this is where he's
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing at me because my, the greatest
weakness I have in Kana is describing
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma accurately, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fine, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm chatting with Mr., I'm just telling
you my caveman sense of what it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then around that time, so that was
late 90s, and then a few years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: I met this dude named Jason King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I met him at Eddie Lep's farm in
Lake County, which is a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: story or whatever, and Jason was trying to
go around the triangle and photograph and
[SPEAKER_00]: make blurbs about a bunch of the old
school heirloom weed, okay, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: around then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And him and I became pretty good friends
then, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I helped him go around Mendocino and
go around all these places, which at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time was like very underground and very
suspicious of outsiders, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And get sort of an in, okay, on all that
different, and with different people that
[SPEAKER_00]: would never have let him in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go into the Kana Bible,
the second one at least, all those
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of the Mendo P are from my
garden, ta-da, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of made it a bit more
famous, obviously, because it was rated in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and so that kind of boosted it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another part of it where
my buddy CSI, okay, got ahold of this
[SPEAKER_00]: weird smelling burgundy weed with some
seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was blown away by its aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell like anything else he'd
ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like reddish looking and wild,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hunts it down, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually found people that were
friends of mine, okay, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where it had come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like he had to like hop from this
person to this person to this person to
[SPEAKER_00]: this person, but he ended up kind of
getting closer to me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got close enough to me that those
people told him the real story,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, that I told just now combined with
like who I got it, the old man,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cancer, the swinging down of the you
know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's funny is that at that point,
various people were lying to him,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, and telling him that they had read
it and giving him a bunch of guff,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he ends up meeting me and I claim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize at the time that it
was anything or that he had had three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four other people that had claimed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he asks me to tell what I knew
about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start chatting about it and I start
telling him the story and then I like
[SPEAKER_00]: sheepishly admit that we had this error
with this old ass, super sharp hydro farm
[SPEAKER_00]: hood that dude missed the stud in my
bedroom ceiling and the thing swung down
[SPEAKER_00]: and killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently that part of the tale had
been told to him by his friend and no one
[SPEAKER_00]: else had brought up that little tidbit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, holy crap, this is the
person that popped it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had these weird little details
that nobody else had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of weird details, someone asked,
has there ever been an essential oil
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis from real Afghani or Nepalese
hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to the best of my knowledge,
however, I mean, I'm sure lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: Europeans could pull it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would always be interested to see
what some of these old hashy, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: insensi plans like the man Mendo P show up
on like a full panel compared to something
[SPEAKER_02]: like actual traditional hash on a full
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, I have a point to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when I was going, when I was
going out to Amsterdam quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a bit, all I did was go to stores and
buy essentially what we would call today,
[SPEAKER_00]: recweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually I made friends and I
started getting weed and hash that was too
[SPEAKER_00]: good to make it into the shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better than recweed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people, this is,
you know, in Amsterdam, it's mostly a hash
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and a lot of people don't know
this, but a lot of, a lot of the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think Yosemite and stuff has talked
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the growers that were growing
weed for like the, the coffee shops and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that were actually growing it
for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would take that money and they
would try to buy the best traditional hash
[SPEAKER_00]: they could get their hands on,
which was rare, hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the top qualities literally never made
it into the shops because it was swooped
[SPEAKER_00]: up by all the collectors before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I met this dude, they call him the
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked, he grew for Neville,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve had this collection of different
kinds of hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's favorite hash that they could
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they had stuff, they had Lebanese,
they had Moroccan, they had this,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had that, but apparently the best
hash, their favorite was this Nepalese
[SPEAKER_00]: temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said the best hash that was from
Nepal was these Nepalese temple balls,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was Westerners or Europeans in this
sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Europeans going over there and helping the
farmers with cleanliness and purity and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the processes to keep it a little
nicer for export to the Dutch market.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sort of like, like Nepalese
strains grown by Nepalese farmers in their
[SPEAKER_00]: Tehwah or whatever, you know, in the high
elevations and all this different stuff or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it comes to extracting and
processing it, the euros just added a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of like cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the processing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoke this Nepalese temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is the only thing that I have ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tasted like the Mendo P. Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying that Mendo P has some
unique flavor or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I am saying is that maybe for
whatever reason, Mendo P might be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the only things that survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: West with that flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting because it's not like
it was absent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that you and I have like talked
about and I've shown you before is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you, I've gone through every issue of
high times up until I guess 2005 or six,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then like basically the same with
every other counterculture magazine for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find lots of early stories of
very, very like bold genetic purples in
[SPEAKER_02]: your region, but there was a timeline gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like, I showed you that picture that's
like, you know, that little kind of squat,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like hybrid leaf looking purple thing
in Mendo in 81.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed you the purple skunk and all of
that stuff from like the like mid Sam
[SPEAKER_02]: days, those photos and stuff, but like
it's just, all of those things seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of like go off the timeline at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as you see like 85,
86 and all of like articles and magazines
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff are mostly dominated by what's
happening with like the booming Dutch seed
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a lot of that stuff was lost up
into basically the pre days of the purple
[SPEAKER_02]: craze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously it wasn't all lost and people
had their own projects and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like it's interesting how it came back
with like a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it almost seemed like at another
point it was like, wow, like even that old
[SPEAKER_02]: article on Dolores is like, wow,
look at this deep purple alien weed shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think I didn't, I didn't realize
it when I was young and going over there
[SPEAKER_00]: and buying a bunch of seed from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: How temporary availability is and how
things can, you know, and so it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have a huge plethora of things,
you know, from back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a few things that have survived
here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I, so that's kind of
like, that's kind of the Mendo P story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the Mendo P story like starts
with me in the sense that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I cracked the seeds, but it also starts
with this old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also ties to, you know,
late seventies, 77, that's when he was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when with the hippie hashish trail
and stuff like that, um, a lot of early
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans and a lot of early hybrids from
that region started making their way to
[SPEAKER_00]: California and Oregon in the mid to late
seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the sort of the first wave,
because the first wave of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: America was pretty much seeds from
imported weed, Mexico, Panama,
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia, Jamaica, Thailand, perhaps,
you know, these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Afghans and the Afghan hybrids and
stuff, those got made into hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there weren't free seeds with your
purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so the people on the hippie
hashish trail, they started giving Afghans
[SPEAKER_00]: and Afghan hybrids to people up and down
the West coast that they were friends
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, everything from like,
that's where the NL things started,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in Mendo and Humboldt,
where there's like very old, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: weed growing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started getting a hold of that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so, you know,
what's, what's ended up happening is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it turns out over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably that like Mendo P is
a premier breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI used to joke with me that like,
we could do a giveaway of a bunch of S
[SPEAKER_00]: ones and have people pick their favorites
and then have them post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there would be such variation in what
people picked, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was such a, there's a lot of
S ones where it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's a lot more narrow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo was one of the rare ones where
there's literally like dozens of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways you could go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it probably,
if it was 20 or 25% THC, it would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be like one of the most legendary strains
out there, but it's like a lighter high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has incredible terps, incredible
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of variation in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just, Gabby, you know,
I think I told the story before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, that's actually like one of the
things that cemented Gabby and I's
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship was me and my friend Sean,
who sadly passed, gave him a joint of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo P and he hit me up and was like,
what in the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it was just so,
it was so different from everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: that was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so like a lot of old plants,
um, you know, I think it's best attribute
[SPEAKER_00]: is the ability that it's sort of like a
time capsule and that you can breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going back in time to an
earlier time, long before all the sameness
[SPEAKER_00]: came in long before all the inbreeding and
stuff with all the famous cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: have happened in the last 15 or 20 years,
it's just from an earlier time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's really valuable as far
as that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, one of the reasons why we
decided to start with the, with the Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: P story is because it's partially my story
and it requires less interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a disclaimer, when it comes to all
these stories, you can choose to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: as much or as little of it as possible,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because they are just stories and,
um, you know, but, uh, oral histories and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that and stories are,
are neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to do basically every
show we're going to be picking strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, lines, every time there's going to
be a reoccurring segment on strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can even get updated if there's
somebody that you can take audience
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also take audience suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more so than that, if there
happens to be an audience member that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about some strain that they
have a personal friend or a connection to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want that person to like clarify
or add, you know, some, some depth or some
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor to the conversation about things
that they know, it's more than welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff isn't meant to be
definitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to be, to get information out
there for, for younger people,
[SPEAKER_00]: to educate some people and to start a
conversation about the history of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's each person's truth as best they
remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the caveat here would be as,
as calmly as you stated, someone else can
[SPEAKER_01]: come on and tell their truth from their
perspective that people, uh, are nice to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and don't start slinging mud at
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the slinging mud thing, which
sometimes happens, the slinging mud thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think boils down to two basic factors
when it comes to Kana because we all came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, being an OG, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times is tied into, did you
happen to be lucky enough to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: history with a famous strain before it got
famous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to hear your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you were involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times when it comes to
history, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: History is always history is history,
but then there's a bunch of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are like, well, how can I make this
history?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I capitalize on someone else's
story?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of history is like, I'm going to do
this tale that paints me in a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, and so one of the
interesting things about Mendo P is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's such a unique smell and aroma that
almost everything we've found so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that smells like it or comes like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends up being descended from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to like really dive into
all that, uh, about where it went and the
[SPEAKER_00]: various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of info we could get into in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and it's not really
necessarily, it's not like even mine
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this old man gave it to me cause
I gave him an act of kindness,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave it to me and I popped it and
it just, it was just sitting in his closet
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, you know, so there's,
there's that.
