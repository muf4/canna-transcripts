[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go home Hey everybody, Chad Westport
here and I'm here with a little update to
[SPEAKER_00]: my water only experiment going on right
now between the SOHOME living soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: KISS organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I put out a couple videos going over
those soils and Appalachian Supply reached
[SPEAKER_00]: out to me and said, man, you've got to try
our water only soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple bags of the Appalachian
Supply water only soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to add these into the mix and
I got one more suspenseful reveal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always loving to, you know, keep things
interesting around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we for now, we've got a three way
mix going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to make a video and do a
little bit more detailed explanation of
[SPEAKER_00]: this on my own channel, Chad Westport on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But stay tuned to hear FCPO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get some grow updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the water only experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you guys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party on.
I'll go home.
