[SPEAKER_00]: Found me a nice dump of trash,
and I'm about to cannibalize it for all
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take it back and I'm gonna use
it in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, got the chicken wire back out
here, rolled it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna make some tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad, that's about right on my
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, tomato cages coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta go back to the dumpster and get me
some more wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made eight big tomato cages and then
I've got these little smaller either pole
[SPEAKER_00]: beans or cucumbers possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to make a few more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, dumpster diving for the win.
All right, let's go.
All right, let's go.
