[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the right dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?
Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to give people some context on
Instagram, your uncle fungus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I and I'm Peter, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you on the East Coast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Central, Southeast Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's been just giving people context.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been posting a bunch about spotted
lantern flies and then Bavaria bassiana,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so can I just turn the mic over to you
to drop some knowledge on spotted lantern
[SPEAKER_02]: flies and the targeted Bavaria bassiana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to start out by saying,
you know, I'm not an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a self-taught mycologist, citizen
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered, you know, we had
Pennsylvania where I'm at is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: epicenter of where the spotted lantern fly
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you share my screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty much the epicenter of
where the spotted lantern fly originated
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been kind of, you know,
I've seen basically the whole shockwave of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation for the past four or five
years, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think like three years ago
I was hiking and I found a spotted lantern
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: An infested area that was covered in this
white fuzzy mold looking substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew right away that it was a
pathogenic fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fact that, you know, it's
actually, it could be high value to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to keep the insect,
the specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cultured it, just did like a sterile
swab onto water agar, and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: expanded it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also took that one specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to just swab the body of it and
catch other living healthy spotted lantern
[SPEAKER_00]: flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that swab, I was just able to,
you know, touch them on their face,
[SPEAKER_00]: on their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would incubate them in like a
little hamster cage with some moss and
[SPEAKER_00]: some moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just kind of ride it out and
see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was riding a bunch of experiments for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a break for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cage still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, we're talking like really,
you know, like simple science type stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but like, yeah, this cage,
it's completely contaminated with spores
[SPEAKER_00]: from the very bossiana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear you put, when you said- Have
them hold that up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make them big and then have them hold that
up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't let, let me see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you, it's like having my
three-year-old on the, on the controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now hold it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a question real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said you touched them in
different spots, you were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: touching them with Bovera and bossiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the specimen that I had, I swabbed it
and then took the living specimens and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of them actually, because they're
everywhere, swabbed them, incubated them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a chamber and record the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that for a while and the results
were actually really like instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say within hours, I was seeing a
decline in the health of the living
[SPEAKER_00]: specimens in the cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 24 hours, they were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then four to eight hours, you had the
fungus, you know, growing out of its
[SPEAKER_00]: exoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hold what you were holding up
before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you were like thumb or stamp size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my, I call it my Bovera
bossiana torture chamber for the spotted
[SPEAKER_00]: lanternflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the Roman Coliseum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put, uh, you know, moss in there,
um, just to kind of recreate like a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the, you know, the spores,
everything, they like to lay dormant and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, dirt and in the ground and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take, uh, that's actually that just
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super cool that like, I mean,
on the negative side, when you have like
[SPEAKER_02]: septoria or other fungal things,
it sucks to have it in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this case, it just lingers waiting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I took two years off just to test the
shelf life of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for two years, I didn't, I didn't,
this container sat there for two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: dried out, a dry cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, just as past, like just a
few weeks ago, I started the experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: again, just to see if I, if I could re,
you know, uh, re-infect these,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, insects by the, with this cage and
threw them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day they're all like sluggish or
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the next day they were growing like
the, the very bossy on like the typical
[SPEAKER_00]: white filamentous mold coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you held up that stall or in that
video that, that, that, that fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: looking growth that was on the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you saying that that was what combats
them or is that their babies, the
[SPEAKER_01]: lanternfly babies?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's talking about those,
like the aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a video that fungus on that
stock that was showing, uh, here,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, make the, the ins, make my shared
screen big again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think you're talking about these
guys, which are aphids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, uh, actually went viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are called woolly aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are a native pest, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's what they're on a beach tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they can cause some illness with
American beach trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, when they're disturbed,
they, uh, you know, they flap,
[SPEAKER_00]: they move around, um, really just like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool to see, uh, I was talking
about the initial video that you put up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when you first spotted the
lanternflies, the very initial video,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a stick with some stuff on the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some growth on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that right there, what is,
or is that a Q-tip?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blind and dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm catching up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right there, I'm swabbing the specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, let's see, 24, 48 hours ago,
uh, I took an infected specimen that had
[SPEAKER_00]: all the filamentous mold growing out of it
from my incubation torture chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw that infected dead specimen that
had the invisible mold growing out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a spray bottle with a little bit of
water, switched it around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like stirred it up and then went
outside to my maple tree where,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they had been incinerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I just started spraying,
uh, you know, just reachable, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, healthy insects, uh, went out,
uh, this morning or actually like midday
[SPEAKER_00]: today and found these two specimens right
here, uh, underneath the tree with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with, I would say maybe 50 or so dead or
dying, uh, spotted lanternflies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, this is you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you sprayed yesterday and this was
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's essentially, it's, it sounds kind
of similar for lack of better term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or an education, like a, uh, insect frass,
JMS or IMO kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you add some sort of surfactant with
the spray or did you just go straight with
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, it was just water and the insect,
the infected insect has switched it up
[SPEAKER_00]: really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I said, it had mold growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, that's, that's just
how you can expand the culture in a five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is your spray bottle here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always tell anyone who,
who grows, uh, you know, uh, crops
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, if you guys find in your grow,
especially in your grow, and it's a pest
[SPEAKER_00]: and you find like a moldy insect,
you need to save that specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you should document, you should send
to someone who knows how to work with it
[SPEAKER_00]: because that could be potential,
like some of the best, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pest treatment for, for instance,
like you could, you could do, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically you're, you're taking
your mycology skill set, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of like, taking spores and saving
them and making sure they don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And has anybody tried that on Japanese
beetles?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would love to find, uh, you need to
find the right strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to find a Japanese beetle that's
infected with the Bavaria bossiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you get lucky, uh, you know,
like I was lucky enough to find a spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the way I keep this culture alive
is that at each year I just like infect
[SPEAKER_00]: new specimens with the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spores are what are most, uh,
you know, they're, they're, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like the deadly, uh, the fatal,
uh, you know, mortality, uh, of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the insect in the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you, what do you think about,
what do you think about catching some
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese beetles and putting them in a
container and spraying them with the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf, shelf bugger?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tried that with that strain and
nothing's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be a specific species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some other pollinator insects
with this strain of Bavaria bossiana and
[SPEAKER_00]: it hasn't affected them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really worried about
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting affected by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome that you tested that
collateral damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you, how do you find out for sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm asking, cause I don't,
I truly don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you find out for sure that it's
Bavaria bossiana that is what that that
[SPEAKER_01]: spore that's coming out?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is there in, are there many species of
Bavaria bossiana or is it some like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like does that question make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: For what we know, it's, it's just
different strains of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more selective at hosts or their
host insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some are a lot more broad too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like you can get multiple species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think most of the Bavaria
bossiana, this is just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know this for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, the Bavaria bossiana spores
that you can get for, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, remediation of pests and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's multiple different strains
combined together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what would make sense to me
because they're so selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to their hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's interesting is when I saw
your posts, that was kind of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time I even thought about the fact that
there are different strains of Bavaria
[SPEAKER_02]: bossiana and it's not just all one strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so you, you've tested this on a
bunch of different insects and you found
[SPEAKER_02]: that the only one that works on is the
spotted lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular strain, as far as I know,
I probably tested about 15 or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know, common importance
insects that I would feel, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it might not be good or that one
needs to go like Japanese beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tested on Japanese beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, didn't have any luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't affect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's definitely complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, there's a lot that I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot more than I do, but,
uh, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I mean, have you talked to any,
but like I, besides you, I know no one who
[SPEAKER_02]: has found the targeted, uh, spotted
lanternfly Bavaria bossiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I have sent a few years ago,
I know a bunch of people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycological community who study and
specialize in parasitic fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: like cordyceps and other different species
and Bavaria bossiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's, that's what they
specialize in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent them the culture a couple of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, here, here's your, you know,
I know you're going to do good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to study it for me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we'll all come together on
the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all in the general same
consensus of, of what we're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like the caterpillar,
uh, you know, and inside cannabis buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a, I'm not quite sure the
name scientific name, but there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thuringiensis helps with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know if it's Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's strains of Bavaria that do
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's bacillus thuringiensis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is mind blowing that just, I mean,
it's kind of, well, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: human diseases, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, or like the bird flu,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like something that sticks with one
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they jump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are spotted lantern flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my thinking is maybe like what you're,
what you're doing, it could be similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: like making a Chiddom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application could just be as simple as
instead of fermenting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you consider making a, um,
a non-microbial solution with some worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings or something like that and seeing
if you could touch a few of them with that
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if it has a similar effect just to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the Bavaria might be, might be
coming out of the soil here or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for the ignorance of my
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most effective way that you're going
to make the Bavaria faciana work for you
[SPEAKER_00]: is if you take the spores and add them to
like your foliar sprays and just apply it
[SPEAKER_00]: with like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can put it with, with like
whatever other, uh, microbe solutions you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to add while you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as those spores are there and
they're hitting the insects, that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause, uh, you know, termination
of whatever it's, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some research on, uh,
living mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've taken spotlander flies and put
that on a plate of colonized plate of
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I put them on there and
they came in contact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it didn't really do much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had really low, uh, fatality
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but when I exposed it to just like a
swab of some spores, um, they're within
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, you're starting to see them get
sluggish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then they're dead within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're, they've, uh,
you know, the mold, uh, the fungus is
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to their exoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not, no, I mean, it's like,
if, I mean, if you think about how kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a public effort to eliminate them
before they kind of get to what,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Japanese beetle out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is huge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, you got a little laggy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't catch that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I said, given that there's like a
public effort to prevent spotted lantern
[SPEAKER_02]: flies from, from becoming a like invasive
species on the level of Japanese beetles
[SPEAKER_02]: or like, uh, what, what's the carp that's
coming up the Mississippi, the Asian carp
[SPEAKER_02]: or, uh, like, uh, you know, it like,
have you run this by people who are kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of at the government level trying to
eliminate them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I was, I was in contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think Penn State did a study on,
uh, of a very bossy on a strain that was
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can look at those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can, you can look them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're public results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look into that and what they,
what they found and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, by the time I found that specimens
started working with it, someone directed
[SPEAKER_00]: me to this guy at Cornell university was
doing a write-up by then by the time I got
[SPEAKER_00]: in contact with them, he was, he'd already
finished his write-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I missed the boat on that one,
but, um, now I mean, from what I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past five, six years, uh,
the populations of spotted lantern flies
[SPEAKER_00]: in my area, like I said, I was in the
epicenter of where the invasion started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the, the, you couldn't walk in
your backyard without one flying in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was, it was pretty thick,
uh, the invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I haven't noticed a whole lot of
crop damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like the, uh, they said that it was
going to destroy a bunch of crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like grapes and, um, all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I have a grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hops, uh, that grow on my property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't noticed any physical damage
except for the damage of the invasive tree
[SPEAKER_00]: of heaven, um, that, that, you know,
grows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually, it comes from their part of
the world, from Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've killed pretty much all the
invasive trees in the area, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's actually had some
good outcomes from this invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, we have like, barely any tree
of heaven anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the, um, the numbers are,
are declining immensely, uh, since they
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, we have invasive, uh,
insects like prey manis, Asian prey manis
[SPEAKER_00]: that love to eat them, you know,
and I think our natural, uh, insects and
[SPEAKER_00]: predators here are actually starting to
kind of see them as a meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think the numbers have
just declined naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've witnessed, um, diseases, uh,
with, with spotted lantern fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like deformed wing disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, diseases that, that they've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think they've had a lot of
challenges just by naturally showing up
[SPEAKER_00]: here, exploding in population,
but then getting, you know, leveled back
[SPEAKER_00]: down by just natural, just, just the
balance, you know, and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms do there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that's in, that's interesting
because I mean, obviously the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the public kind of dialogue is around
like, we need to get them under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what, what I'm hearing from you is
the initial freak out was probably just
[SPEAKER_02]: cause we didn't know what they would do
and your anecdotal evidence of just what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing is like, they're not
targeting stuff that's native.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not targeting cash crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're mostly targeting the stuff from
where they're from that is invasive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah, they have, um, many predators,
but I think that number is, is inclining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're having a lot more
predators now, especially other invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: predators, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, I haven't seen any
actual physical damage on the crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: they said that they were actually going to
go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, in my opinion,
I don't think it was as bad as they said
[SPEAKER_00]: it was going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that, that's, I mean, this is all,
I thought looking at your posts and then
[SPEAKER_02]: also your kind of comments about just,
they're not that bad from your,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, encounters with them was all kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it all interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it super interesting too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tracks that track two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, that makes my mind curate
curiously wonder, like, is Bavaria Baciana
[SPEAKER_01]: popping up in the JMS mixes and things
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the Jadam book offers a
specific solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very similar along the lines of
what you're doing, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but has a recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're obviously controllable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what I agree with you, the hype,
it's interesting the way you took a look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it and say, Hey, maybe they're just
going to get the invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody's pumping some funding for
some bullshit somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't go or some interest
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings up a lot of questions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm offering the sport swabs that you saw
me doing in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just offered them on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any mycologists out there,
um, how do we find them?
[SPEAKER_01]: On your website again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a way I can post it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's www you know, unclefungus.com it's
unklefungus.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You type in unkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be one of the first results to
pop up on Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me my spelling for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one bad eye that works barely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Share my screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the right link?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think it's unkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's unkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get two, get two sports swabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, if you're a mycologist
and you have this invasive species and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to play around with it and do some
research and add to the data pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which is what I want to get done here
is just add to the data pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these swabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, you can just take a
living spot, let it fly, take that swab
[SPEAKER_00]: and just rub it on its face and then
incubate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it should, it should kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have a specimen to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that you can continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can continue to keep that culture
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have specimens to keep,
you know, feeding it, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can have, or you get a whole
bunch of these, you infect a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of these and you take the whole bunch of
them, you throw them in a spray bottle and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can advocate, you know, a solution to,
to, you know, kill whatever is in your
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard or on your trees or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could inoculate, you could inoculate
your living soil beds with it as well and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will inoculate the soil.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that, yeah, that's also mind blown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just the way it kind of spores
work in the sense that they can just be
[SPEAKER_02]: dormant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, you said it was bone dry for
two years and then came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think, you know, again,
uh, BT for Caterpillar super targeted,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, to be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something for the Japanese
beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking, I'm hopefully I'll run into a
Japanese beetle, you know, covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: Bavaria bossiana or infected because,
um, that would, that would be an awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I would, I would really like to
find something like that out in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, just walking around,
you find insect that's like moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that there's a lot of value in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of potential typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see me, if you see me touching
Japanese beetles in a bucket next week
[SPEAKER_01]: with straight JMS, don't laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I like the mush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the artwork behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shower curtain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody called it liquor bird wallpaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll, we'll have to, uh,
we have some mycology enthusiasts in the
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd and we'll have to bring you back on,
uh, less impromptu, but, uh, I appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume you finished dinner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said you finished dinner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I got like three kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go up and do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for jumping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll be in touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to connect DP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to connect them with you and,
uh, and green table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sinazi and the, the mycology crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So high guy with the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to hang around this phone
call with us, but, but first, thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you coming on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get done this evening before I go
to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: See ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't believe he's killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor lantern flies, but that was cool,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I saw him post on that and I just
thought it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The joy of having a daily show is when
shit crosses my radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can be like, Hey, um, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
