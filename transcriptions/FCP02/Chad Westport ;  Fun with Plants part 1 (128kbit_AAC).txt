[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, Chad Westport here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to have fun with a few
what-ifs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first what-if is, what if,
what if I topped the plant right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: discarding all of that above and only
keeping that below?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it would live?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an awful lot to take off,
but sometimes you have no choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another fun thing that we're going to do
with this, since we're going to top it
[SPEAKER_00]: down here and we've got all of that above,
do you think if I put that in the arrow
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner it will clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, but let's find out
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so as you can see, I've got it all
lined up to be cut and I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pan up and down so you can see once again
the ridiculousness of this cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's pan up and check her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, she's too tall to
flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of let her go this long because I
wanted to pre-sex her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have determined that she is a she
through the pre-flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I cut it back and play
around with it, if it lives, I'll get a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice bush anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cut her at my angle here
right above the two branches that I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, two, three, clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's so thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even cut this bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now this is a scraggly looking
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to train it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to clean it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see what it looks like later,
but let's go check out our monster clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, you can see the absolute absurdity
of this size of clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said earlier, there's a dozen good
clones on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really wanted to take a clone,
they're in there, not the one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got it in the Aerocloner and
we're going to find out if it works just
[SPEAKER_00]: because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and place your bets in the
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what I've done with this
plant is I've taken those stems that were
[SPEAKER_00]: going up and I've bent them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to serve a couple purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is these inner node spaces here,
here, here, here, all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches are going to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to fill this area in and make
it fairly bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I've done here is I've
used my binder clips to take them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because of phototropism, these are
actually going to start to curl back up at
[SPEAKER_00]: the point that they're bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is no longer going to stick down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually going to come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look for the light and
follow the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to curl back up and it's going
to be a nice bushy plant and kind of stay
[SPEAKER_00]: within the confines of the structure given
by the plot or pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about an hour into this monster
sitting in the clone machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, I took some of the
families off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to give it more of a
fighting chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to transpire too much and
there's not enough water in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually have expected the least to
go limp by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been, you know, like I said,
it's been over an hour since I cloned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still pretty turgid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough water in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if it stays that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crap, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 24 hours later and this thing is not
only still alive, it's looking more turgid
[SPEAKER_00]: and more water pressure in there than when
I cut it off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can this thing really be a true clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting close to two weeks into
this after I chopped the top off and bent
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, what I bent down is
starting to curl back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was way down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, phototropism is going to want
to grow towards the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about the same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm controlling the apical dominance
and all the auxins and where all the
[SPEAKER_00]: priority is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, we've got these middle nodes
that are now starting to put off their
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are going to come fill up the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will continue to grow up around the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, at the end of the day,
we're going to have a monster bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness, you guys, we are over a
week into this thing being chopped off
[SPEAKER_00]: crudely by the scissors and stuffed in
this aeroponics machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it still alive, and not limp,
all of the leaves are looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing's starting to get roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys think I'm going to be able to
get enough roots for this whole thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to put it back in the
aerocloner for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it back in the
aerocloner.
