[SPEAKER_00]: All right, today we are going to activate
some EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our old activated EM1 container.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're going to take our
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you want to get good molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want something that you wouldn't
want to consume yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put that into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to use 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, thick, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a food for the effective
microorganisms to consume while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quote-unquote activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking what's in here and making a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that looks about 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be a lot more scientific and
actually measure it if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and for the water, we have this
beautiful water tank right behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get that in there,
we're going to take the EM1, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: mix it in there with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 5%, so about 10% of the total
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and get the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some goldfish down in here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just scared them off,
but we'll get the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have all the amazing microbes
that the goldfish are producing in there
[SPEAKER_00]: to help activate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, you can go to taraganics
.com and they have a wide assortment of
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful things for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be good after about seven
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep it in kind of a warm,
dark place and it will speed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: activation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really warm, it might go a little
bit before then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we'll check back in in about
seven days and we'll show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: activated EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's been about a week,
week and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have activated EM1 ready for our
disposal over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I just throw it on basically
everything that I'm trying to inoculate.
