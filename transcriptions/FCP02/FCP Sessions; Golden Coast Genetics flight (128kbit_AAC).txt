[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing would be if you didn't want
to, otherwise all are welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wow, we're live?
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, we're at the sesh we had for 20 last
week and we're super excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're smacking some Golden Coast
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, anyone who's watching or
watching in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to Golden Coast for giving us
all of these flavors on the table and I
[SPEAKER_07]: think that just to frustrate Peter,
we're starting with some Forum Cut Girl
[SPEAKER_07]: Scout cookies and then we're gonna move
into some really interesting stuff but the
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl Scout cookies and I think we can go
around because we all smelled it,
[SPEAKER_07]: smelled really awesome but then here
there's some more land racy stuff and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: just gonna be a great sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what did Zach, I know you had some
really cool smell notes on the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_07]: on the Forum Cut.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was the aroma I got was this great
nutty coffee ground vibe and very sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cookies stood out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has such a foundation as a tone.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to see if it translates.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I bet it will.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very impressive in how rich,
even for the amount in the bag,
[SPEAKER_10]: it was very just invasive.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I love the turp that just gets right in
there and it's undeniably a Forum Cut.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, it's so cookies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like nutty and yeasty and sweet and
like vanilla.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just great but also like mothball-y.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really complex.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stoked to try it but you all were
smelling stuff before we got here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did anything else stand out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, the lemon cherry gelato,
that one was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had like a very nice vanilla kind of
frosting smell so it was really sweet and
[SPEAKER_04]: it really stood out to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys haven't smelled it,
then definitely take a whiff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super nice, like delicate,
almost yeasty sort of smell to it but I
[SPEAKER_06]: think this is a great mix of stuff we have
in front of us here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Gold Coast Genetics is a great job
presenting what he's known for and what
[SPEAKER_06]: he's passionate for with his land-raised
crosses present in the Columbian Haze and
[SPEAKER_06]: the Albert Walker crosses we have and some
of the more new hyper stuff you could call
[SPEAKER_06]: it like the lemon cherry gelatos and
everything else we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're rolling up right now,
Otis, what are we rolling up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Forum cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're rolling up the Girl Scout Cookies
forum cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think, yeah, Jaz, if you want
to pick another one to go in on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we also have, we have the garlic
skunk strain here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one Peter was getting ripped
on on 420 and this is actually something
[SPEAKER_06]: unique because we have the dry sift
version and rosin version of this as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for real?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something, yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have three different variants of the
same strain and that's something unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: You very rarely get to see that so we'll
definitely get a chance to compare that on
[SPEAKER_06]: the show today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right now we're talking about the
garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have this in flower form as well as
rosin and dry sift form.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very rare that you get different
forms of the same cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're definitely excited to tuck into
that on the show today and do a deeper
[SPEAKER_06]: dive on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll roll some of that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We maybe will put some of the wax into the
joints and yeah, the dry sift definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: will put a garlic skunk square joint up in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: A donut, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, this is such an amazing
selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, Jaz, are you more familiar with
Golden Ghost's work and sort of which one
[SPEAKER_07]: of these are meaningful parts of his
stable and his sort of genetic library?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm aware he's very passionate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Him and Peter connect a lot on the land
race side of things and specifically just
[SPEAKER_06]: all across.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look on what we have present here,
it is mostly South American land race
[SPEAKER_06]: crosses such as the Colombian hazes and
other variants of sort.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is cool because he does have some
modern stuff too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like as mentioned before, the lemon cherry
gelato, the garlic skunk, the Maynard
[SPEAKER_06]: Callio.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a bunch of new stuff and we're
going to tuck into it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really what I'm most excited for is
there's a Colombian haze A somewhere here
[SPEAKER_06]: that smells ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely want to tuck into that and
see what the experience will be like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave really is a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I've seen him and Peter connect on
YouTube, it feels like there's a really
[SPEAKER_07]: strong understanding of just what makes
quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of love to see that there's
someone who's like a purveyor of things
[SPEAKER_07]: like these equatorial hazes and is also
like, yeah, the form cut is good enough
[SPEAKER_07]: that it makes the cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like there's sort of isn't any
sort of biases that really is just about
[SPEAKER_07]: quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tend to find that those people that
mindset are the best growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everything we've examined here so
far, whether it be old school genetics or
[SPEAKER_06]: more new, was all given the same amount of
love and care.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can definitely tell in the end
product as you can tell by our reactions
[SPEAKER_06]: when we're just going around right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll definitely share this with you
and what we're thinking too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, Gabe, what do you think
about that joint, man?
[SPEAKER_07]: The first inhale was really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely reminds me of cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has that kind of ginger bready thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the first hit, the cherry is
always a little hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll have something to say about it in
a second, but enjoyable smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I certainly, I certainly think the
dry pole was really, really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like cookies is just good,
comfortable, neutral smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you want like when you have an
ounce of cookies, you don't resent it by
[SPEAKER_07]: the smalls at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you sort of are just down to keep
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and other things can be a little
more difficult and a little more
[SPEAKER_07]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas I would describe cookies as like
the most unchallenging smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely a stable in anyone's
stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely a strain stable in everyone's
trying to collaborate at this point in
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or some variant of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otis, I just want to say I love your
Organics Alive hat, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Organics Alive, friend of the
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Eric, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eric, no nutrient company or I guess
beneficial company pulls up to events and
[SPEAKER_07]: really supports the community in SoCal,
like Organics Alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Organics Alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out BioAg up north.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out all the homies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out everyone, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the homies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to see a Free Seed Day,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Free Seed Day and it was great to get to
talk to Trevor last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: These sessions have just become such a
such a cool meeting place for so many
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that hash, I mean, I'm still I still
think that that hash from Uplift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's spectacular.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uplift of Minds is so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the best material I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were out there on 422 at King of
Zeal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just awesome seeing community come
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what do you think of that cookie?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: The flavor profile is still developing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very kooky.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, Jazz, did you want to get into the
hazes next or the cushions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know that the Albert Walker is
in there, too, and you mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got your pants are going to be busy
tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Busy hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really intrigued by that Albert
Walker dog OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was told that Albert Walker is not a
Skywalker, but rather something a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit older.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just something I'd never seen before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really curious about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess in the chat, can you tell us
if the Albert Walker is a part of the dog
[SPEAKER_07]: walker?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like the dog walker is a
really popular one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pretty sure that it's just like
Chem X Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think getting to try like known
parentage, like I've never tried the Eddie
[SPEAKER_07]: LeFo dream that's in so many things like
getting the opportunity to try these,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, meaningful parents is always
really cool to get to understand sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: the history of popular turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's kind of lemony cheesy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's very interesting as a no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fruity on that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nose on that is super, super nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys get that kind of like the
Albert Walker dog walker?
[SPEAKER_02]: That one is very nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you say every single person open up
one of those containers?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no shade.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, like totally great.
[SPEAKER_09]: All this product is amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: All this stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we were all we were all interested in
the difference between the Tupperware
[SPEAKER_10]: versus the bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems that the bag based on structure,
quality, knows, seems like it's indoor
[SPEAKER_10]: work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's there's this these
Tupperware that seems like it's depths.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not throwing like depths are cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm going to leave.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I think we've and I don't know
if we've had this conversation yet,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I mean, mixed light makes for some of
the best hash on earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some of the best flour to depending
on strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it Calio number six.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one is one of the most stinky ones
I've smelled so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one smells great.
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't Calio.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Manic Calio.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Calio is Manic Irene.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one is the Manic Calio.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think Manic may be Peter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I don't know if there's something
to pull up or if it seeds you sell.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it seems like Manic is a running theme
around these jars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that's like a common parent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Irene is another one where like I've
rarely seen the Irene on its own,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's just in so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would roll that one up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Manic Manic Calio number six.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one smells great.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a good orange.
[SPEAKER_07]: Manic Calio.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to roll the lemon
charge a lot of eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll run our life up at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like what we're doing right now where
we're switching it in with the land race
[SPEAKER_06]: and then one of the newer strains and then
switching it back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it'll be a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Peter, is that
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That the Tupperware is mix light and the
Tupperware is stuff that he grew at home.
OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just texted him asking how he grew
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, and thank you so much to
Golden Coast for this spread.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also shout out to homey kebab senpai.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you use his discount, you can get 15%
off on Brothers Broadleafs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not forget.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you use the homey kebab senpai's
discount code on Brothers Broadleafs
[SPEAKER_06]: website, you can get 15% off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the discount?
[SPEAKER_11]: I've talked to them a long time ago about
carrying that stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to follow up with them again.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best blunt you can buy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is the code kebab senpai?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so that everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the code?
[SPEAKER_06]: The code is just kebabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: All caps.
[SPEAKER_06]: A, B, O, B, S.
[SPEAKER_06]: K, A.
[SPEAKER_06]: K, A, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, there's two ways to spell
kebab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just making sure they know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for blunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're putting a haze in blunts.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the one that I'm about to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gabe can't hate on it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what it's called, is it?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's just.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what the noses are
reminiscent of.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some kind of Mandarin vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_12]: The Calio number six.
[SPEAKER_07]: Manic Calio number six.
[SPEAKER_07]: It definitely is Calio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think it's only Calio,
but I think Calio must mean Calio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Based on that nose.
[SPEAKER_10]: C-A-L-I-O.
[SPEAKER_12]: Manic Calio number six.
[SPEAKER_12]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a nug in here to smell.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, a chocolatey vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's like a walkers chocolate
orange, like the English ones.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: What am I experiencing?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm experiencing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like a walkers chocolate
orange.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, chocolate orange.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say the tootsie pop,
the orange.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like biting into the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not even.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just like broken glass into the
turpiness of orange and chocolate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like a chalky chocolate.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's another nug right here to put in
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chalk is for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like chalky is a turp profile that will
come out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those candy wafers things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who made this?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: This came from over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pink Z?
[SPEAKER_10]: Pink Z?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unravelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unravelling.
[SPEAKER_10]: That Durbin poison note.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it feeling?
[SPEAKER_10]: How's it feeling?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the good homey Tetris.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is pretty.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope it translates in the flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, definitely like I smell that
definitely that orangey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangerine like creamsicle type for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one also has kind of like that light
glaze, the sweetness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope I can taste this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a nice thing to taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Manicalio number six.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: The flavor really developed in this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this at 35.
[SPEAKER_12]: I needed to get halfway through this
before I could like get that classic
[SPEAKER_12]: cookie flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we were just saying,
is that the mintiness really just came out
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's so jazz was just pointing out how
smooth it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, great job, Dave.
[SPEAKER_07]: So far you're one for one on on the trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Triple A is for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a cookie with a good cookie
flavor and not the doo doo musty flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that that well well point of
like gas that's just well rounded and not
[SPEAKER_06]: too obscure, but not too much either.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super well balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely smooth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who here actually likes hazes?
[SPEAKER_12]: I like haze.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoke them in the morning and they get
me lit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the hazes I've tried.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like I think I've hazed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the best haze I saw was Pifco
screen haze, but I really don't know how
[SPEAKER_07]: many of those like true 110 plus day
aquaponics grown in Miami type,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like that real haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something I'd love to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: More of.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I want to smoke some haze where I
was in.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like some real haze or haze like
hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like lower than my lifesaver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a dry sift would be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be on the haze.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet there's like some old heads who have
some stories about like haze finger hash
[SPEAKER_10]: or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bouncing it on screens.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's like you have to be in a very
cold environment pretty much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you done dry sift?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just seen the Internet, you know,
and of course, like the traditional way
[SPEAKER_10]: that people make it, which is pretty cool,
like with these like endless amounts of
[SPEAKER_10]: filtered screens and like, you know,
these are people in Morocco or people
[SPEAKER_10]: making this in Afghanistan or something
like that, which is like super cool and
[SPEAKER_10]: like all the different varieties and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's super.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, every micron is different,
you know, and the way of course how it's
[SPEAKER_10]: how it's constantly processed in like
certain seasons and stuff like that's so
[SPEAKER_10]: cool to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like a very ritualized
event, you know, which I like a lot about
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of weed stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's the ritual to history.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's also how things were originally
sort of like preserved and how turps were
[SPEAKER_07]: actually shared across the world was in
hash, you know, like how it can be
[SPEAKER_10]: preserved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we should on that note,
definitely in the next joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, we should we should smoke
what Peter smoked on 420 next.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe we should roll a hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of dry sift and some of the
rosin in it as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dry sift I think is near me.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have rosin dry sift and flour of the
same form and from the same person as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you'd like to check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very impressed by the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just you can the like when you're
breathing it in the way that it invades
[SPEAKER_10]: and fills the the sinus and everything is
like super has it just it is full.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is like the jazz can.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what this can is right here?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's currently aimed at you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the flower?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's an empty jar of garlic.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a little green, but I mean,
like dry sift is dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like you're removing
certain size heads and it's doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_10]: just because it's green doesn't mean it's
bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that dry sift or is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I guess I guess I was assuming it was
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mean, I mean, it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It depends on it's basically dried.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is cured already.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure it's cured.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, usually dry sift has to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it but it's, you know,
it's like I don't know if this is from his
[SPEAKER_10]: trim bin or whatever, but I hope he's it
is from his trim bin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trim bin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nicely done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has such a I mean, dry sift.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's very, very rich.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of has some like gassy notes to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's it's herbal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got some like a sweet lemon notes to
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's it's I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever played around with any skunk
genetics?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they wash?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't personally washed, but I've
heard good numbers about some of their
[SPEAKER_10]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to think what would be the
greatest that I've seen by them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was just talking about like skunk
one type cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I think I think you're saying skunk
house genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, but I think you're just
abbreviating.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're I know they're they're work
wash.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have great genetics for washing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually I haven't.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't washed any skunk genetics,
but I'd be down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring them to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring me your fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will do for the science,
for the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's only right that we put the
lemon cherry gelato on a blunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we are we is the actual going to be
the bullet?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: The actual has to be in a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to taste the colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like now you're getting picky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love blunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're they're guilty pleasure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really can't beat a man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lemon cherry in a blunt is it's like the
20th century.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's timeless.
[SPEAKER_06]: A blunt is times.
[SPEAKER_06]: But lemon cherry in the blunt,
I would say that's a rather new trend.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is lemon cherry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the blunt is kind of like hitting
the Fortnight dance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, nobody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can smoke lemon cherry gelato in a
blunt in any state in the United States.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an interesting one to go around
the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is lemon cherry gelato runs?
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer your say what you were going to say
and then answer the question.
[SPEAKER_07]: But is lemon cherry gelato runs?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a question on a pose to the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first I was going to say,
well, putting lemon cherry gelato in a
[SPEAKER_04]: blunt, it kind of takes away from that
flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why it goes great in a paper or
a cone or, you know, in a bonk hit,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a solid rip, because you can really
get that rush of that flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I don't know, it just lights off
the terpenes in a magical way.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100 percent of Ruth, that statement.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this is superior tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a brother's broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the weed's good, it shines.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the pink Z really came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have faith in it just because the
pink Z, I can really taste the flavor of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can really still taste the fruitiness
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll give it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he had it was the pink Z that was
in the last blunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the pink zebra?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Don't Panic.
[SPEAKER_06]: We smoked on 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We smoked the fruit soups as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess and I'm curious, what do
people think about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I agree that it's super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it is very similar to Runtz,
but there's something.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's obviously a different Fino,
but is it the same thing or is it a Runtz?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it just a gelato Fino like people
say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a 33 bag seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's closer to cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you get that sweetness and
then also you get that dark purplish
[SPEAKER_04]: normally with those orange-ish hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get that nice little combo which
you really see in a lot of the cake
[SPEAKER_04]: mixtures.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I definitely really like the gelatos
more than the Runtz personally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's Runtz.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it tastes like Runtz.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tastes like a floral fruit punch yogurt
or some kind of funky funky old milk vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's pretty consistent amongst
all of them I've tasted and I know a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of people rename everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been around.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been around.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm gonna be very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a Runtz fan.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Certain gelatos I do enjoy a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: 41, that's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: 41's a classic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good in a blunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so good in a blunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think one of the stories about lemon
cherry gelato, the one that is other than
[SPEAKER_07]: it being Runtz, is that it was a connected
41 bag seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so similar and so closely related
regardless, but it's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: The mythology of Runtz versus... So right
now we're rolling up the Manic Calio No.
[SPEAKER_12]: 6, which tastes like Japanese food,
which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the other Fino tastes like Chinese
food.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Japanese food?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this one's Japanese food.
[SPEAKER_10]: Soy sauce base versus... This one tastes
like seaweed salad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Umami.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, umami, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is present in a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of my favorite... Finding that
kind of kimchi note that's in food too,
[SPEAKER_10]: or in meat too, is super delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also feel like because you like it,
you are more attuned to seeing it in
[SPEAKER_07]: things that people describe in more purely
dessert-y tones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what it was that we were looking
at recently, and I was thinking of it as
[SPEAKER_07]: just like a straight dessert profile,
and then you very astutely called out that
[SPEAKER_07]: there were some of those... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might have been a Skittles
cross, which, you know, you don't normally
[SPEAKER_07]: think about that being in Skittles,
but it's there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_12]: The flavor's translating.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's that like tootsie roll,
tootsie pop that you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like a...
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of like a condensed milk thing,
but then also kind of like a seaweed
[SPEAKER_12]: salad, like... Like good seaweed salad
with like sesame oil.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it's a sesame oil thing I'm tasting
more than seaweed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the condensed milk is that umami.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're gonna get that from this,
dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you crushed that descript,
like that's... Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Taste that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're gonna get that condensed milk for
sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more sesame oil than seaweed salad,
I didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_12]: That one was manic.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Number six.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because you said condensed milk,
to me, it totally just tastes like a less
[SPEAKER_07]: sweet Thai ice tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a less overtly sugary.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Max, you're gonna like this one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would sit on that joint and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one's fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the um... The Manic Calio number six.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one has a spectacular look,
super triked out, a lot of pistols on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has the perps, has the color, has the
smell to it, like we said.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna put this one in the blend,
just roll it all up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Manic Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting that all the Manic Irene
pinos are so... This is the Manic Calio,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: 2012 times thin mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that is sound good for next.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one smells crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That definitely has like a mint back
undertone.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cookies are unbelievable, Peter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you not a fan?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet Peter, do you want to ask Dave what
2012 is?
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I might have to take this one home
with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Manic Calio number six.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got orange flavor, which I like.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really does though.
[SPEAKER_12]: 2012 times mints.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chinese foods over here and then Japanese
food is right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where's the Chinese food one?
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this one also.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's a very Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's be more specific about what that
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a non-Chinese food number three.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we were talking, you just briefly
mentioned what kind of Japanese food are
[SPEAKER_10]: we talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it can be very, that's a very
complex thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That smells great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells super nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to put it in the joint.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually, no, it's definitely on
that weird, not weird, but tahini.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got this kind of rich sesame vibe for
sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's very accurate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's cured.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cured.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you can taste the curedness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we're rolling to LCG,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really thought Otis's note of condensed
milk was spot on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get any of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Condensed milk, Thai tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no wheat in it though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no wheat in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this Chinese food one, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has again with the sour dairy note.
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells like the same shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sour dairy note with like the acidic,
very acidic, whereas you taste the
[SPEAKER_10]: tangerine in the, you know, but it's also
very acidic, which I think is the
[SPEAKER_10]: relationship with also the, like ponzu or
something, like something that has like a
[SPEAKER_10]: sharp citrus, but not sweet citrus.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lemon cherry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be honest too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has like a vomit vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like, I like, I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the same sort of vibes from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of like that, you know, like that
piffy hazy almost like, like youth throw
[SPEAKER_06]: ups sort of, sort of nose to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, like when someone pukes in
front of you and like you're holding up
[SPEAKER_06]: the urge to not puke.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the puke.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's been there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a real homie, you've been around
another homie puke.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a Terp description.
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep it real over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't all be winners.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and the good homie Greasy Gator
frequently talks about like baby vomit as
[SPEAKER_07]: a Terp that's in the 33 heavy.
That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there was someone,
if I could find my phone, there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: chemical compound that they associate it
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll find it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you got those very potty flavored
jelly beans that taste like gross stuff,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a Terp.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think some like grease monkey
I've always talked about is being like one
[SPEAKER_10]: of the nastiest terpenes that I've tasted
where it has that acidic poo, poo vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like this curry poo vibe,
curry poo vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, that's number six.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm about to roll the number three.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love curry.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: The similar smelling one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nasty, kind of intense.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, gets really into this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this one's way stickier.
[SPEAKER_12]: This one, the number three is way stickier
than the number six.
[SPEAKER_12]: The number six was maybe just more far
along in the dry or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Butric acid is what contributes to that
puke.
[SPEAKER_07]: Butric acid is what is, and it's very
common in a lot of the gelato progeny.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's gross and amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but then there's that orange thing
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a really orange back,
like back end.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this Calio has to be Calio.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like spelled like it's like a South
American land race.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like C-A-L-I-O, but I think it's just
Cali-O.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't need to exoticize it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just California.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cali-O.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Cali-ounce.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Cali-O.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cali-O.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cali-O.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an English land race.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez, English land race.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grown in Scotland's foggy hills,
the Mittenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cali-O is like the OG California orange
train.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think Cali-O is the common parent
of like tangy and then everything that
[SPEAKER_07]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's with us still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali-O is in Cali-Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew, you seen this one?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seen the last one?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I like smelling this haze,
but I don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: The haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: The haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just called the haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colombian slash haze A.
[SPEAKER_10]: The A1.
[SPEAKER_10]: The A1 is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's what I would throw in the
blunt jazz.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I would, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Blue for the sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have multiple blunts, Gabe.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a worry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Italian cheese on that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: These Tupperwares are very cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a great method of getting people
work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Parmesan turps, which also has,
Parmesan has that butic acid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about whatever 2012 is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, let me ask him again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess, Peter, a question for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which of these genetics have been like
most popular in seed on the site?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we literally just put them up this
week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is everyone's introduction.
[SPEAKER_12]: And are these the crosses offered in seed?
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them are, and some of them are
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruity.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then a bunch of this stuff from the
facility is doing R&D for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should definitely smoke one of the ones
that is available in seed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well the Albert Walker one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Curve Paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy them on Daga.Garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can buy almost.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can buy lots of amazing things there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, to set it best.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy anything you can imagine on
DagaAcademy.com and Daga Gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Daga Garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Daga Garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can read all the flower reviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your little heart could ever desire on
Daga Academy.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the best sites to learn and
interact with a very friendly community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much more articulate over there than we
are over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no Instagram word limit
either, so shout out my English class
[SPEAKER_06]: teacher.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you write?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two page limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think we just got an
incredible, an incredible piece of
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge that if your element pack
doesn't have a windmill, you probably
[SPEAKER_07]: should go and buy some Curve Papers off
Daga.Garden because you have fake element
[SPEAKER_07]: papers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke real papers, people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't smoke that caca.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, OCB, classic old school.
[SPEAKER_11]: We aren't smoking that dog shit over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're smoking that Albert Walker dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: The papers, or certain papers on my bed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice tip in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Scooby Snacks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Scooby Snack Cannon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scooby Snack Cannon.
[SPEAKER_10]: No tool, drop a cannon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which cut?
[SPEAKER_10]: What cut is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, chop, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, chop, just chop.
[SPEAKER_06]: This lemon cherry gelato is... Is it turps
with power?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, I would say out of the three things
we've tried so far, it's euphoric flights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out Saint Smallbatch, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, dream guest shoe to the roof.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not as citrusy as usual on the drop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was the flower purple?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have the flower here?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
What?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I see that?
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see that nug.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is a good lemon cherry.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's actually a very well done phenol
of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The strain that I would say I see the most
of, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, and you know, it makes it
so when you do get a good batch,
[SPEAKER_06]: it makes for a pleasant surprise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's good candy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, are there tobacco seeds on the
website?
[SPEAKER_07]: If people want to grow their own leaf?
[SPEAKER_11]: I give them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't sell them, but I've given like...
How long do you think it takes to grow?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you have to grow a big enough tree
to get the leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a couple months.
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple months?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's big, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a corn stalker.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like when you're flowering out for
seed, you have to wait.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then have you ever done that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you, anyone cured it?
[SPEAKER_11]: You cured it?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's... I was like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I knew, I knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's the review.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been waiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely still wish it was in a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bow's Nose, Nose of the Small Garden or
that one's from PDX.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one's actually, that one's
from PDX Pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and who sent this down?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look up on Instagram, TwoTurpee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: TwoTurkey and Instagram, dog.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on to that for just a second more,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Lovelace Gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who it's actually from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovelace Gardens, Lovelace Gardens in
Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, Portland?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right around Eugene, Portland,
Oregon, right around that area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, the lemon cherry gelato
has made one round around.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does everyone think?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably one of the better I've
smoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sweeter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Much more developed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got like a, I feel like I just,
yeah, I guess mids there's, I've smoked
[SPEAKER_10]: only mids and this is above it,
but this is delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good job not being mids.
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the name of the guy who grew it?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the name of the homie who grew it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Golden Coast Genetics is not mids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trademark.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Golden Coast is not mids.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the weed that we smoked tonight has
been delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone that's smoking mids thinking it's
gas, change your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, runs your life up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Runs your life up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only interesting one tonight has been
that manicadio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, I actually,
I saw a young LB in real life last week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chinese food?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this is the lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me like an orange chicken vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that gives me like an orange
chicken, like slash sesame chicken vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that like burnt, no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that burnt, yeah, I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smelled it and I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, just giving me a... I personally
loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just as smooth and that full body
taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could taste it definitely through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was saying earlier, I definitely
still wish it was in a joint, but all the
[SPEAKER_04]: flavors still came through and it was
definitely one of my favorites out of all
[SPEAKER_04]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also got Otis over there on the rolling
station.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the rolling master.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, dude, Jazz, that was a great roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz with the rolled blunt too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matthew in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matthew in the background rolling up some
good ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good roller.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always about how it's rolled.
[SPEAKER_10]: The delivery.
[SPEAKER_10]: A joke is best.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have the right delivery,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have the punch line.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have good material.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you have to have the delivery.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see this rolling tag.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got some cool rolling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rolling tech over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do a little stuffer.
[SPEAKER_10]: He does the cone tech.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a cone head.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cone head.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cone head.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cone head.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are from France.
[SPEAKER_10]: This lemon cherry is blowing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got like some honey notes in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: How sweet it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say like, it definitely
seemed like it was, it was taken full term
[SPEAKER_06]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like with the notes I'm getting,
it's very different from some lemon
[SPEAKER_06]: cherries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell how much of it's from the
blunt, but it is like a good balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, like that honey note with
the slight nuttiness of sorts you get from
[SPEAKER_06]: the gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just that general floral
sweetness as well without like that sickly
[SPEAKER_06]: sweetness, you know, that sometimes you
get from some variants of lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_06]: gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it also doesn't have the peppery note
that happens when you take it too long,
[SPEAKER_07]: like decidedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's, it's pretty dialed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done very, very well.
[SPEAKER_12]: He runs his life up.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's safe to say we here at FCP believe
lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: And runs are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to do the walk?
[SPEAKER_10]: The dog walker, Albert dog walker.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That had also some very cakey vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a great structure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big fat nug.
[SPEAKER_10]: Both of them big old nugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of trichomes on the leaves on the
sugar leaf that was left there,
[SPEAKER_10]: which I also have to say I like your
trimming style.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's always a, you know, indication of,
of a headiness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, it's the presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it is, you know,
a lot of, when I get stuff directly from
[SPEAKER_07]: growers, a lot of the times they give it
to me untrimmed and they're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is how I'd want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you do that yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little annoying, but I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the preservation of the,
I do think it preserves the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there is something to be said
about whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like self-serve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everyone has a different visual
appearance preference, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some prefer some sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some prefer a lot of sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some prefer none.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people like the, some people like the
holes in their buds from the machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get it how you live it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, I think we all agree here,
like a more delicate, thoughtful trim is
[SPEAKER_12]: better than a, than a shave, an LA packed
shave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hand trim for the win.
[SPEAKER_07]: Been sending your pack to the barber.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Literally the washing machine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock tumbler.
[SPEAKER_10]: You ever guys ever run one of those
machines?
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys have any experience with those?
[SPEAKER_10]: No trim machines.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, trim machines are ridiculous,
man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you gotta, you gotta have this,
the way they've made, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_10]: originally was for like shucking peanuts
or something, automotive, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's so, I feel like it's definitely
something that's taken from the ag world
[SPEAKER_10]: and thrown into the cannabis world and how
they, how they decided to just like tumble
[SPEAKER_10]: trim this stuff, thinking it would work.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like they never tried it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then seeing people do it like wet,
they're like, oh, you're supposed to do it
[SPEAKER_10]: wet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like there's all this myth, like how it's
done the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, it's all bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also a fundamental misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the fruit isn't the plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's a, the principles might work
from an agricultural perspective.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Chads that don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We boomerang to the love and cherry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Creamy dreamy.
[SPEAKER_12]: This tastes similar to the number six with
that sesame note, but there's something
[SPEAKER_12]: different about this that I haven't
discovered.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's almost less, the number three is
almost like less condensed milky more like
[SPEAKER_12]: sesame oil, Chinese foodie, but it has
the, it has the elements of like elements
[SPEAKER_12]: of orange essence of orange, but
definitely like a, like you just hit some
[SPEAKER_12]: sesame oil for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like at the Korean barbecue, you know what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like a hot knife.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I make hash, I wear a chef's hat.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's number three, AKA Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is peppery, but also has less
more floral.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's more floral.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Less condensed milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Texas.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a blunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Otis, you, you bought this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pearls by OG.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was, I had to wrestle with that one,
but I got it rocking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out for the hand rolls coming soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super small batch.
[SPEAKER_12]: The hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's genius.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's genius.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: The hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to lock me in a basement
until we have a thousand donuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my, where's the basement?
[SPEAKER_02]: At Peter's house.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get occasional piano performances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we got on 420, which was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The best part of 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried to hide our weed, but then we
realized she's married to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's probably all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still hit our weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still hit my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit my rigs and my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was extremely, extremely, literally
extremely grade A performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother watched it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother, my mother said she looked
adorable.
[SPEAKER_06]: FCP is for the children.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we need a theme song eventually.
[SPEAKER_12]: We should get Laker to do a theme song.
[SPEAKER_07]: Laker.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really nice name for rapper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Laker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's a real guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get the peppery floral?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I definitely did.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some pepperinis for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's your speed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's your speed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely louder than the other.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the salt and pepper, like pork
lobs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Salt pepper vibe, like out of the,
out of the little package that you get at
[SPEAKER_10]: the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: You tear it and it's mixed.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're mixed together and you and it's,
yeah, it's like preservative bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's preservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's citrus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like citrus peel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like unfiltered orange.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's like no sweetness at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, like a bitter peel vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Citric acid, like in its, in its finest
form.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like, you're taking the words out
of my mouth, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are exactly what I would call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on the number two
of this?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's less orange.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chocolate vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost has like cushy kind of stuff going
on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really nice to get to smoke two
Fino's side by side to just see how.
[SPEAKER_06]: The variation between the genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: As we've had guests speak about it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that truly is so wide in terms
of the variables you're playing with and
[SPEAKER_06]: the traits that, that can run down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so to find keepers is, you know,
people really do underestimate how hard it
[SPEAKER_06]: is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we get to participate somewhat through
these, these small little different
[SPEAKER_06]: variances of Fino's we get.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really is hard to find a keeper or
just truly pick one that you think
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone would enjoy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think through this, we've also
developed a lot of respect for the growers
[SPEAKER_06]: and breeders who are able to do these and
pick winning crosses and bring them to
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: This laughing gas might be my favorite
nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the laughing gas was honestly,
I thought like all sweetness without that
[SPEAKER_06]: gelato nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we have not yet actually, but when
we're passing it around originally,
[SPEAKER_06]: this was, and I believe this is one of the
newer genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this looks to be indoor run.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys think about this laughing
gas?
[SPEAKER_07]: That one smells awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see this super D fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super D fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: Super D fire.
[SPEAKER_12]: Albert Walker dog.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I smelled that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smelled this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I got that dog in it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Got that dog in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shot that dog walker.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_12]: Mosquito spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like citronella.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: The laughing gas is the one.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a Lysol flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like lemon pledge, but more pledge
than lemon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Albert Walker dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: Laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_10]: This reminds me of some weird Batman shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That one's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a Batman straight laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heath Ledger.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Heath Ledger smoking this kind of,
you know, his impersonation of the joker
[SPEAKER_10]: with the laughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And did we smoke the garlic skunk?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not yet.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do a garlic skunk cannoli.
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds pretty fun to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's enough of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, you smoked all the garlic skunk?
[SPEAKER_12]: Smells good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: As you should.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was your favorite, Peter?
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you like out of all this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should take some dabs right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's sacrifice the mics for some dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder what's up with this hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, you know anything about this rosin?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the micron?
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a micron.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got qualities.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's indoor, outdoor, full spec.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who washed it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Mystery washer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Boss Hoss washed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mission Hill Melts Lobster Farm is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Mission Hill Melts Lobster Family
Farms rosin is sensational.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's some of the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_12]: The honey banana chili.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, honey banana.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like those banana turfs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about food.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Rotten Skateboards,
the big homie.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_12]: Your shit is fired off.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Dabx.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's lobster fan?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's also Rotten Skateboards.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add Rotten Skateboards, smoking on some of
that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some of that honey banana still in the
Dabx chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a crazy compartment, secret
compartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret compartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all you stashes.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want all your rosin to go really
dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craziest save, but I accidentally forgot
that there was rosin on here and I flew
[SPEAKER_02]: home to South Carolina last week with
rosin in my Dabx.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely could have taken a rip in
the smoking section of the airplane.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the bathroom of the plane?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the smoking section.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so tempted.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was in Ohio, they would have these
enclosed, almost like phone booths you'd
[SPEAKER_07]: have to go smoke in.
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone sends us a picture from inside
one of those with a Dabx, there will be
[SPEAKER_07]: something very cool coming your way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Flaming poop on their doorstep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one of the many services offered by
dog-a-dog garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Got haters?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take care of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And shout out our old guest, Jeremy,
who came on a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: His book we have with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We bring it every time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time we come, I read a new page and
I'm captivated by the shit that is going
[SPEAKER_06]: on.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's gonna be a mini-dwank.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna put the hash in the next one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I opened it today and he was like,
he got set up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was dating a girl who had mental
problems and she set him up at a
[SPEAKER_06]: McDonald's and then the cops pulled up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe each week you can tell us what you
read in the next chapter.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was chapter 13.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tune in to chapter 14, tidbits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll definitely have our book club
session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Audio books by Jazz.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just another service offered by dog-a-dog
garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Different voices.
[SPEAKER_11]: Different voices.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get Zach Wood singing a goodnight
lullaby?
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of New York, the video that I saw
Golden Coast on also had JJ from Top Dog
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was this cool like East West Coast
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like I didn't get the strongest
sense of what Golden Coast likes to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one's the number three.
[SPEAKER_11]: Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Peter, what does Golden Coast,
when you've spoken with him, like what is
[SPEAKER_07]: his favorite stuff to smoke out of all of
this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or where do his personal preferences lie?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think some of the stuff he wants to
explore more is like the Thai stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Thai.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a Thai velvet buzzsaw thing that I
like to smoke in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The velvet buzzsaw is insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a weird structure and it's
delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is so elongated and like you said,
it is a very unique butt structure,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the high itself is just something that
is so great.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is some nice dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's some sticky dry sift.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have some dry sift that I've been saving
from various harvests in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like probably like a pound and a half of
dry sift from like harvests when I was
[SPEAKER_12]: working at a bigger like facility.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a lot of GMO, but some of it is
really carefully sifted and it's all just
[SPEAKER_12]: like melty like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all dabbleable.
[SPEAKER_12]: These varying grades of, you know,
debris behind.
[SPEAKER_12]: Three star.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I got some three star.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got some two and a half star.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_12]: You still got two and a half star fam?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what hashiness is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's some of these combusted, you know,
materials that makes up like what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like you can refine it too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I have it in my freezer still.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got these big ass jars.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a whole shelf in the freezer just
all filled with dry sift jars like from
[SPEAKER_12]: like the last few years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think when refined dry sift can be
some of the most pleasant smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean like the, was it resin ranch that
we tried that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was resin ranch.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has some great dry sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a hot dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: $500?
[SPEAKER_12]: I like $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with this glass Max?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a glass by the real Dillinger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little thumb print, thumby tube
with some little bit of a little rewag on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_12]: For all you glass collectors, this is some
heady shit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heady glass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Real heady.
[SPEAKER_12]: From the heady Karen.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, from the heady Karen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the pendee today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm rocking a rice made this pendee.
[SPEAKER_02]: He blows glass out of Peace of Mind OC in
Newport Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go sure to check him out at Rice Made This
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Made This.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer, killer work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool, very cool fume work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very chill there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have six of these, same pendee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am a big collector of his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's this cap?
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a nice size dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, if anyone is ever doing the Smoking
Olympics, OG is the ringer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a small dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, that was funny shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cough cam?
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have the cough cam now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no memory of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he was sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heady Karen, could I get in the line?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like the effervescent notes that are
on Kevin GMO without the garlic full body
[SPEAKER_12]: dark notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out John Doe, the homie,
for hitting me with the ninja dab on 420.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want to give him 450 or 440,
because 500 was... Because it's a better
[SPEAKER_12]: banger than what we're dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I usually have the booty slurper,
the fucking whatever the hell.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, I'm not even using the Toro.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm using the boot-like slurper.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a real Toro right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the G-West.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, G-West.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, G-West out of the G-West.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no hate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And shout out to what is Forrest Gump?
[SPEAKER_07]: SD Dank Quartz.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to SD Dank Quartz, 619 holding
it down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to Forrest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely shout out to Forrest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, big Forrest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Forrest, one of our SESH regulars,
I'm interested in talking to him about it,
[SPEAKER_07]: but he was involved in something that won
CushDock in some capacity, so
[SPEAKER_07]: congratulations, Forrest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, shout out to Forrest.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to think of him as the residential
rousin expert here at the SESHs.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of always.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But certainly the ambassador with the
most.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We miss you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're eating cookies that taste like
tri-tip for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's the, what are you rolling up?
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And where's the rousin?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, like you rolled it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm gonna sprinkle the dry sift in.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna be dank.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Otis, did you take a dab with the
Honey Bananas Wilson or the?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I smoked this, dude, the garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was effervescent notes similar to
GMO and chem.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think that probably comes from
the garlic part of the lineage.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then some lemon from the skunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, you know, GMO without the
full body and like, like a lemony chem
[SPEAKER_12]: without like some of the more like bitter
chem notes, which is really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big fan of chem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam can never go wrong with chem.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a huge fan of chem.
[SPEAKER_12]: And those notes that I call bitter,
I like.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a chem I-95.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pax and I did a chem I-95 Durban that is
like, it's like more, more funky,
[SPEAKER_12]: skunky, bitter than like GMO even.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we called it, we were like joking.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were like, we should just like call
this like new GMO, but it's better than
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not better than GMO, but it deserves it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the breeder behind that
is having a moving sale.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if anyone's interested in covert
genetics, unfortunately, I don't think on
[SPEAKER_07]: doggadotgarden, but available on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: His stuff rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cuts or just seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want cuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm taking orphans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with that?
Big dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't that good?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dabs to the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dabs to the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs to the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm just weak.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nah, those are some clouds of respect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, there's something about that nail.
[SPEAKER_12]: That nail is powerful, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Char.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give you a few seconds to recuperate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what'd you taste on that, Gabe?
[SPEAKER_07]: Lemony.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, that was, that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lemony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super lemony.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lemony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemony with like an earthy undertone.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly what I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely super gassy.
Who's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're next?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Jazz is next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz is next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Very garlicky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see this right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, I understand if you were smoking on
that all 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a long day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I started early and...
[SPEAKER_10]: Started early at 420 a.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rolling a fatty in his garage.
[SPEAKER_11]: Two joints at once.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did anyone smoke like a ridiculously large
joint for 420 or something that was like
[SPEAKER_10]: cartoonishly funny, like comedically?
[SPEAKER_10]: You got ninja dabbed.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got ninja dabbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's never fun, but also kind
of... But some awesome fresh press,
[SPEAKER_07]: not fresh press, but some rainbow belts
that was fresh press.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what did I get ninja'd with?
[SPEAKER_07]: Something good.
[SPEAKER_07]: BHF.
[SPEAKER_07]: BHF.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some CRC.
[SPEAKER_12]: Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_06]: A diamond.
[SPEAKER_12]: CBD isolate from the internet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might've been the dark, mega dark Z.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the mega dark D from mega dark Z
from Super Dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was really nice, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You weren't mad.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was actually the surprise dab of 420
along with the pie dough from JD's Turf
[SPEAKER_06]: Farm Shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the mega dark is the super Zope,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the Zope variant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the blue is their Z.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the red is their RS11.
[SPEAKER_06]: Drive safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Golden Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been... Great smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for the flavor flight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we truly enjoyed this and we're
all looking forward to this Albert Dog
[SPEAKER_06]: that's getting rolled up right now.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Albert Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I extremely want to try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have everyone rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I could roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: Packing cones.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people could roll here?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can roll.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, two.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, not like... I can't roll like you,
but you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy can roll.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you pack a cone?
[SPEAKER_02]: With a stick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scoop stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: You pull up with a stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to get that test.
You're a stoofer.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but really it is a properly rolled
joint elevates the smoking experience so
[SPEAKER_07]: much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you just crush it every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you want to talk about sort of
the dimensions that you go for.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, for me, I think rather than
rolling like a long skinny joint with the
[SPEAKER_12]: same amount of weed, you can roll a
shorter fatter joint where there's more
[SPEAKER_12]: surface area that's being vaporized and
smoked throughout the whole joint.
[SPEAKER_12]: Four to the front of the joint is going to
be smoked.
[SPEAKER_12]: Back of it's vaporized from the hot air
and hot smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uniform dimensions.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can roll cones and stuff,
but you know, whatever is easiest for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the uniformity.
[SPEAKER_12]: It burns you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uniform.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't want it to be too tight.
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to be able to draw.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to use a couple of crutches,
but you know, everyone rolls their own
[SPEAKER_12]: way.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not like you don't have glass tips.
[SPEAKER_12]: You do any of those?
[SPEAKER_12]: I have glass tips, but I just I don't like
having to like wash them and shit like I'd
[SPEAKER_12]: rather just like I can make something that
feels as sturdy as a glass tip out of like
[SPEAKER_12]: four crutches.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then again, people claim that the
crutches have a flavor to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, I just like I'll roll like a fat
joint with no no tip at all and just get
[SPEAKER_12]: everybody's mouth covered in scooby
snacks.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I like glass tips.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like glass tips.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to make some as soon as I'm blown
more glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be sick.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the use of capillary tubing to make
tips got really big through Gordo
[SPEAKER_12]: Scientific's RIP tips.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, everyone check out if you have
Instagram Otis King glass glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otis King glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some really cool pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: We use them on the show all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can all verify they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should definitely check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: This piece isn't by you, but it's by your
mentor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to talk about this?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't know if he wants me to tell
very much about that, but he's a legendary
[SPEAKER_12]: guy in the color game and he did a line of
bongs secretly once and this is one of
[SPEAKER_12]: them.
[SPEAKER_12]: But shout out to you if you're watching,
you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the definition of petty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll rip it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll rip it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got to see what's up with that functional
glass.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is garlic skunk x garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Excited about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, tell us about the playlist
selection tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about the more diverse playlist
tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: You kept it.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are these weeks on a DJ?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you up in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You DJs vinyl and some of the finest DJs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hot Steppa.
[SPEAKER_12]: The goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go check out their mobile DJ sound system.
[SPEAKER_12]: Check out their Instagram to see where
it's at.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hot Steppa Supply Co.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to the big homie right here,
Tetris.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that the first smoke of the day
event and the vibes that you brought,
[SPEAKER_07]: that was one of the coolest things this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Such a cool way to kick off the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I didn't go to that one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was literally, I think I was literally
out of the state, but the vibes were so
[SPEAKER_12]: apparently bomb that I could feel it
through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're radiating vibes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the whole team brought the A game
that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Garlic skunk x garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Otis, you barred this joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once again, we just want to emphasize
it's very rare that you get the
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunity to try different versions of
the same strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so thank you once again, Golden Coast
Genetics, for providing this opportunity
[SPEAKER_06]: with the garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm pretty sure this torch is super
loud right now, but we love hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_07]: The garlic skunk is, I just described as
like super GMO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super GMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: White rhino laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a white rhino cross to the
laughing gas?
[SPEAKER_06]: Laughing gas crosses the white rhino
manic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we smoke the laughing gas?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe roll up the laughing gas first and
then the next one.
[SPEAKER_12]: Laughing gas smells just like Zaza.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there somebody selling laughing gas at
this event?
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should get somebody doing that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Potion man, maybe?
[SPEAKER_07]: Two for five.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck the authority.
[SPEAKER_06]: We missed you, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are the ice cold fatties?
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to climb over the chair.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ice cold fatties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Three for 20?
[SPEAKER_12]: Shout out to fish.
[SPEAKER_12]: The nitrous mafia.
[SPEAKER_12]: That should be a shirt.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got custied at the fish show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Three for five.
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be sick.
[SPEAKER_12]: Inside us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three for 20, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think super GMO would be the best way to
describe this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once again, with all the flavors we've
been able to try today, just very well
[SPEAKER_06]: done, super mature grown smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the dry sip actually has like,
I had a really unique component to this,
[SPEAKER_06]: similar almost to like, dare I say,
a full melt hash whole of sorts in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of like the upliftedness I'm feeling and
the smoothness and slow burn of the Stubi
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That nail rips.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a clowder.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for taking rippers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh nice, that's tank.
[SPEAKER_11]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, lime, lime.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lime aid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lime aid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Super delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gorkos might need a part two.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much weed on this table,
we still have not even tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like a lime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a lemon cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super sweet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's good, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Super GMO.
[SPEAKER_12]: With the GMO hash snake in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it's more effervescent.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like in the rosin, you're getting
more of like the lemony skunky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lemony with almost like a light chem sort
of back into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the chem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bare GMO taste at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, it's those light lemon
curbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost effervescent is the best way to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sort of glides over.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like champagne bubbles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like fleeting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: What am I smoking right now?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're gonna smoke some laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very Zaza.
[SPEAKER_12]: It smells super Zaza.
[SPEAKER_10]: Zazotic.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting to smoke the hash and
then going right into the flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like smoking hash and flower from the
same plant or same like mother plant
[SPEAKER_12]: genetic grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm aiming to do that with my hash holes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: One, you know, one and like the oil and
the flower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfectly like full spectrum and then you
have the rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we've been calling it freshies.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been calling them freshies.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was perfect temp, by the way,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: It had like a key lime pie vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good descriptor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Key limes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to San Diego today.

[SPEAKER_10]: It's the honesty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wu-Tang-ing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wu-Tang, no way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yo, what does the chat think about
Wu-Tang-ing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if someone in the chat is a
proponent of Wu-Tang-ing, we'd love to
[SPEAKER_07]: meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a ritual.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's boss.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a humiliation ritual is what it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is like a truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a camera right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter's taking a big ass dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our producer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our producer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a Peter cam.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's the Pete cam?
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think, Peter?
[SPEAKER_10]: Low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shit's smoking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of the garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Garlic skunk is a real big winner.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, garlic skunk's dank.
[SPEAKER_10]: Real big winner.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already where I need to be.
Is this live right now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's live, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Endless noise.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heady.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heady coffee.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heady records.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pull up on Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a vibe.
It's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a vibe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, pause.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you twisting up right now?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_06]: The laughing ass crossed to the... Wait,
just the laughing ass?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just the laughing ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: We put that in the... We put the garlic...
Double garlic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's late.
[SPEAKER_11]: Super garlic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to take a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter made a great point.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might have to make it a two-part.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should make this a two-part.
[SPEAKER_12]: Peter, we might have to make the full
lineup a two-part.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's already too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you smelled it so strong.
[SPEAKER_12]: We still have a shitload to try.
[SPEAKER_12]: We probably did like five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, we tried like four or five,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: That lemon cherry gelato, I think,
was still...
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your guys' favorite strength you
guys tried?
[SPEAKER_02]: The cookie.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm smoking on cookie, you're smoking on
mild.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that... What is it, the GMO we just
smoked, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The garlic skunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit was hitting.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be cliché, but I think for me
it was the lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one kind of took me by surprise.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, at least it was...
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the one I enjoyed the most out of
all these.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm also partial because I like
blunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll leave that be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the garlic skunk was also
phenomenal, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be my flower tick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a big GMO fan.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the Calio, manic Calio.
[SPEAKER_07]: The two or the three?
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the six.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a word.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you were saying the six was the one
with more citrus terms or less citrus
[SPEAKER_06]: terms?
[SPEAKER_12]: Six was more like condensed milk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like more intense, lactic, vomiting,
condensed milk.
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that sort of rotten milk sort of?
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoked the six first.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, then the number three was more
citrusy to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: More floral.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not necessarily more citrusy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think after we light this, it might be
time for us to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's getting so high.
[SPEAKER_12]: Old Coast did a great job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Golden Coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, I mean... Good chronic.
[SPEAKER_07]: For every palette, there was something
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one that really hit mine was as
good a representation of that strain as
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everyone really hopped on a flavor
flight today and was able to find
[SPEAKER_06]: something they really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Gold Coast, again.
[SPEAKER_12]: The chronic was bubonic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's flowing easy today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you so much, everyone,
for watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you everyone for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys have a great rest of your
night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tune in next Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great week.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it.
Thank you.
