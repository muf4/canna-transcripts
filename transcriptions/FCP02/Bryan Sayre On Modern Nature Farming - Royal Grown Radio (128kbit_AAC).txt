[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great transition point like to
jump us forward a little bit because I
[SPEAKER_00]: could sit and listen to these stories of
black bear and dead to her all day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to talk a little bit about
cultivation and how We got to where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: now with you out doing the design and cult
and consulting so I first visited your
[SPEAKER_00]: farm scarlet fire farms out in Willow
Creek What was it probably seven years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: now or so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes 2015 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I believe when we were filming an
episode of growing exposed which you can
[SPEAKER_00]: check out still on the growing exposed
website It's still out there and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: features Brian Telling you some of the
secrets that you may have to pay him a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of money for now to get him out to
consult So there's a lot of really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that day but One of them was
that we owned the same piece of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owned it apparently directly after you
in Willow Creek and You know, that was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my first outdoor farms in Humboldt we
connected over the fact that well there
[SPEAKER_00]: was no Sun for about five months and You
know among other things it was my first
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to scaled up KNF Making your own
nutrients all the way from scratch
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally you guys were fermenting deer
carcasses you were doing all sorts as to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting your own seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're trying Everything and that's
where all these kind of new Modalities of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and permaculture and
sustainability are coming from is those
[SPEAKER_00]: days of experimentation What led you to
that moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know because I'm you went down a long
road of cultivation with two lights in a
[SPEAKER_00]: closet apparently Tell us about some of
that road As far as the you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the KNF or actually the modern nature
farming which is more of a you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Current way of explaining it was just
really intriguing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've started was introduced to a
friend ancient dank on Instagram and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just like kind of watching some of the
stuff that he was doing and it's like this
[SPEAKER_01]: is so crazy like Why shouldn't why let's
try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we're in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can harvest what we need Let's give it
a try, you know, and there was kind of on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cutting edge You know is on the edge
of like a big change anyway So it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: how can we make this change even more
exciting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right So yeah Of course with all the
experience, you know the years and years
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried pretty much everything You
know, I started out with general
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics, you know, the the green and
the green in the red and then you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried once they changed into the was
that the I Can't remember their organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Product that they put out but anyway,
we changed into that Oh general organics
[SPEAKER_01]: general organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it slipped my mind Yeah,
and I was going hard with that one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that one worked out really well
But as we were kind of scaling from inside
[SPEAKER_01]: to outside It just didn't really seem like
it would fit to be using bottles You know
[SPEAKER_01]: expense purposes waste purposes all that
kind of stuff, you know I felt like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're indoor you're kind of creating this
like little world your little laboratory
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're you do all these different
things right because you have to you're
[SPEAKER_01]: creating your own environment So,
you know, you feel like you're forced to
[SPEAKER_01]: use bottles and whatnot And then also the
lack of knowledge that was out there open
[SPEAKER_01]: for everyone to have so again once I moved
out into the Larger scale outdoor and I
[SPEAKER_01]: could do it year after year during the
wonderful 215 era We could start logging
[SPEAKER_01]: data and start seeing different changes on
What we were using and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just when suddenly it realized we were
dumping like a thousand dollars of liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients into the Into the reservoir for
one feeding app, you know in the height of
[SPEAKER_01]: the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, holy shit I I feed quite a
lot, you know, this can't balance out
[SPEAKER_01]: properly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean I feel like as we were getting
pushed towards this legalization and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation I think we were also getting
pushed into like real business life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Was slowly sliding down year after
year after year Yeah, overhead was going
[SPEAKER_01]: up up up because for whatever reason every
reason land costs were going up You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, we went through and you know a gas
spike back then too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're dealing with that so Yeah,
I just feel like I was like, okay Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's make some changes because you know,
the prices are dropping and there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: competition And so let's see if we can
create our own niche and that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of what got got me down that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it I feel like nowadays
everybody's so Hell-bent on data and
[SPEAKER_01]: Analytics and all that kind of stuff that
it really started getting a little strange
[SPEAKER_01]: for me personally Like I'm making all
these beautiful these wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all smell absolutely gross But what
are we actually putting into the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because we don't have any We're not
getting tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like, you know If if we ferment if we
ferment this product for three days longer
[SPEAKER_01]: than we did the last time It's could be a
completely different thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming out of the inputs right how
quickly there's a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and in my experience Sorry modern
nature farmers, but in my experience I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: a yield drop Now I did see a quality
increase and we're always more interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in quality than quality Right,
but striking the balance striking the
[SPEAKER_01]: balance is key and in a changing Climate
that you're dealing with and I mean family
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the different things that you
generate as you grow Yeah, it was just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I had to take a step away from that
and kind of go back to a more conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: form of cultivation Make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean now I'm seeing that it's a little
bit easier for me to relay what I'm trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to teach these different farms that I go
to when I can have a product that's
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you know the exact same thing
every time Repetition is key when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to push a product into market
Especially now where it's not like oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: well this guy's buying at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's buying at the next time It
could be going anywhere You're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: needing to fit into a niche in the
regulated market where you're selling to
[SPEAKER_00]: the same set of people that take it to the
same set of dispensaries You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's kind of a revolving cast,
it's you know, it's an established cast
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to have consistency so did
that lead you to Really kind of going back
[SPEAKER_00]: more almost to salts or did you end up
seeing more like hybrid technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's What are you seeing now as the
consistent way to get that output?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've always tried to follow the the
natural Input mindset, you know organic
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever organ ish, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always kind of stood along those
lines, you know once I got away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: general hydropon or the you know,
the hydropon the whatever Boxes that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: I always remember it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I always tried to stay with the natural
stuff I've never really been into salts as
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know a nutrient base and I'm
sure that there's a lot of place for that
[SPEAKER_01]: in the new industry because You know,
there's a lot more data collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more Instruments designed to
read that data that you know, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to find But I've always wanted to
organic because I vote I'm a smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like When I'm growing weed,
I'm only smoking my weed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there's other people that I know
that I hold in a high regard that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke there is too but I'm growing for
myself number one and my family and my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, you know, so I always wanted to
be at least natural We all want three
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of light but Do we want to smoke
the weed that is typically created off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the three pounds of light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every time not every time right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's why I always just stuck
with organic type nutrients and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs awesome Were you still making teas
and doing it that way are you more into
[SPEAKER_00]: amending?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like to do a soil amendment You
know, I'm really big into soil analysis so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can track what's being put in and
what's actually being used up I'm I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: big feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do a light amendment Mix,
you know juice up the soil a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I like to do a feeding and my my
choice of product these days is bio biz
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's very natural product They've
been out in the game for they're
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrating their 30th year this month and
Most of their product or their products
[SPEAKER_01]: are derived from beets sugar beets and
it's a fermenting process that they use
[SPEAKER_01]: too So it's you know, you know fashion it
is similar to the modern nature farming
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the consistency of a bottle
product Yeah, it's got a ton of sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's a it's a great
product I really like using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very forgiving You know, it's not
that's one of the things I've learned with
[SPEAKER_01]: salts is that it's not very forgiving and
typically the environment that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: create to Utilize salts efficiently is not
necessarily the Environment that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah being like rock wall and things like
that Well, you eliminate so much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology which a product like bio biz,
especially I Always really like that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid when I use liquids to it was one of
my favorites Because the biology aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you start with an amended soil
like power flower back in the day I loved
[SPEAKER_00]: bio biz with power power flower because
that you know rich sugary Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a mild nutrient really it
really is kind of a mild nutrient It's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely not something you're gonna burn
a plant with I mean you could probably
[SPEAKER_01]: pour the product straight into the plant
and it wouldn't it wouldn't burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: product of the plant We're not
recommending that at home, but you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably could That's always been my MO
when it comes to feeding though I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: been a huge fan of pushing the PPMs to the
to the brink into the stress point like I
[SPEAKER_02]: like to get close right, you know,
but I've always kind of been more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: on the like, you know on a moderate
strength nutrient regimen and then
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously I've always been big on teas to
which I feel like Naturally kind of get
[SPEAKER_02]: your get that extra charge in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, but through a fermentation
process Yeah, absolutely What I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: with everybody scaling so large so fast
That I'm seeing people start running into
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with teas and things like that
because there's employee turnover There's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever the different factors
may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so typically when I go to a farm I'm
not pushing teas and things because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole nother learning curve that
somebody needs to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, let's get let's get the ship
righted You know, let's get you going and
[SPEAKER_01]: once you start, you know seeing some You
know ground being covered and seeing some
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in some things Then let's veer
off and try some high-level stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah create a sense Of stability a
platform to build on that's something we
[SPEAKER_00]: say all the time To you know, we get phone
calls from new growers daily at Royal Gold
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like hey start simple Don't like
try everything at once because how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: really know what you're doing at that
point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't know whether this product
worked or that product worked or this one
[SPEAKER_00]: is effective or What burned your plant if
you're throwing all of these things at it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time so I completely agree with
that perspective of like Whoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, let's strip out the duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to a baseline and Create some
new avenues towards improving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot You know cut your costs on
nutrients cut your costs on food and
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly that like if you want optimum
Results would do you starve?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, would you starve the cow if you
want the best meat?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you probably wouldn't I see When my
biggest thing that I see when I go to all
[SPEAKER_01]: these different farms that I've been is
procedure They just lack procedure Which
[SPEAKER_01]: causes More labor cost and chaos and chaos
So I feel like my mindset when I go to
[SPEAKER_01]: farms is typically let's get a procedure
going We're not gonna starve your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because it costs money to feed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna starve your labor Because it
costs money to feed that too because it
[SPEAKER_01]: does yeah, you know We get some complete
procedure in place, you know, you have
[SPEAKER_01]: these milestone targets that you're gonna
have to hit every single harvest so after
[SPEAKER_01]: the second one it's muscle memory and Then
you guys are off and running Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, that's that's really interesting
because with feeding and I'm you know kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of equating this in my head as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Diminishing returns at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you want to feed you need to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big plant feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to push it But there is a point
especially at scale where it hits
[SPEAKER_00]: diminishing returns where okay I'm giving
plants nutrients now that they aren't able
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume in a realistic time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's washing out It's being consumed by
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not effectively contributing to
real-time plant growth You can't overdo it
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same is true of labor and that's
something we're seeing in Humboldt County
[SPEAKER_00]: big time in this crazy press on
mom-and-pop farmers That have been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having to eliminate labor
Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can afford the labor because it's a
diminishing return.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying all this money for these
people to be out there Stripping the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants giving all this care But the cost
per pound is so low now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to find ways to prop the farmers
up and they have to find ways to cut those
[SPEAKER_00]: costs and There's a diminishing return in
overfeeding in over labor and over
[SPEAKER_00]: application of anything That's a good
generalization of it for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's true Yeah, I think that There's
so many the stakes are so high now,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, you know, you can't there's no time
to mess around There's no time to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's you know, kind of a lazy guy,
but he's your bro So like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep them on you know, there's those
days are it's a shame but The culture is
[SPEAKER_01]: being stripped away Just you know some
degree and that's and that's where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing it Yeah, and I like what you said
there It is a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: making hard decisions for people that they
care about and saying hey, man I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't afford to employ you anymore I
can't afford to have you live here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and like work hard for the pushes But
like kick your feet up for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: four months of the six-month grow season
and they're hard decisions being made by
[SPEAKER_00]: people that really care about each other
and that's one of the things that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really fighting hard to kind of help right
the ship with measure ass and now
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's trying to get to Sacramento to
start looking at taxation because these
[SPEAKER_00]: are decisions that are affecting the
overall impact economically and socially
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis on the communities in
Northern, California You You You You You
You You You
