[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so Gabe, we have another
session.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody showed up early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're live.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, we have a great session today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some cookies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some really good hash.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's talk sovereignty with our
sovereignty glass expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for bringing the really sweet
glass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a mini three dome here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a 44 to a 50 to a 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got the 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a down grid stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both partials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got the cold work FA that I
could take a rip out of right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I already have a bull pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody wants to hold this for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's get all in and talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that this down grid stem 44,
it's a ghost over ghost accent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you said, it's a partial accent.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a nice booty color right there,
some bridge color, some nice ice pinch
[SPEAKER_08]: color.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ripping the full accent bull.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's got a nice sovereignty lighter
with some sandblasting, nice etching on on
[SPEAKER_08]: the sides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fatty bulls.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're relatively local, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The pricing on the side of the local.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, local.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're out of Riverside, I believe is
where they blow all the glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they've started super small and became
really big.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a really cult following for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: People prefer to rip those bongs over
anything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've always heard that for function,
you can't beat us all.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not necessarily per se for like
the looks of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the looks are just a give or take.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on if you like the glass or
not.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're about the scientific function
of the perks and how they actually work,
[SPEAKER_08]: not just like how it looks, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so the thing I always feel like my
issue has just been that like sometimes
[SPEAKER_09]: they're too much of a rocket launcher for
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's why that's why there's so
many different perks, because they all
[SPEAKER_08]: have a different effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's going to be one that's going
to be good for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so it I personally like the
forty fours because they rip super fat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some people like these,
the it's I think many three to dome.
[SPEAKER_08]: The domes are really smooth because you
get that extra percolation of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also keeps it really clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you see up here, there's not much
dirty water compared to down here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's super fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's super.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so is that that is the function of the
middle zone is to have like a wider perk,
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a there's different sets.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's like even tree cyclers that
it's a full it's it's the same width.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a forty four the whole way up,
but it has three perks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just more diffusion, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All perked up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have a hash band, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do you want to introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hash right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a lot of solventless extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're from the San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our brand right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got tons of terps for you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to dab up on some stuff,
we got some new strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would love for you guys to try it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that flour that you grew as well?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Older batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But tell us about your medium and how you
like to grow the medium, how we like to
[SPEAKER_08]: grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we we grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we started growing mostly out of
rockwool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I like I like saying like talking to
people about it because I feel like a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of people are like, oh, I only like living
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like you can get a very clean terp.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can drive the plant harder and you
can do a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the resin production creates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're washing that power over
that and you're getting a more full
[SPEAKER_03]: expression through that medium,
which is cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then another thing that people don't
like me saying is that we use salts and
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone says that you lack turps when you
use salts.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I honestly don't see a lack of
anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and you're mostly if I remember the
genetics, I've seen correctly running with
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff that was bred under hydro
conditions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's also like a lot of genetics
were steered towards thriving with those.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the high yielding, high resinous
strains, you know, the really good bag
[SPEAKER_08]: appeal, dense buds like.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what are some of the staples in
your garden?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are some of the staples in your
garden?
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the staples we're trying to get
the cut back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was our big staple.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Peyton's pie is Gary Peyton times
Georgia pie.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a feno that we hunted from a raw
genetics pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Raw genetics has some really good stable
genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's working with some not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's one of those breeders that's not
working with stuff that he's created
[SPEAKER_08]: himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's super stable, high quality
strains that are from really good breeders
[SPEAKER_08]: and well-known people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you even watched it,
but with Chad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he was really good on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you should, because he does a lot
of really cool stuff with the Georgia pie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Georgia pie.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's doing a lot of like blue slushy
crosses, like really cool Z crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unique stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Strawberry turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did a big fido hunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did a big fido hunt on strawberry milk.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did the Peyton's pie.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did a handful of things, honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guala, one of our strains,
it's Scotty's cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's animal mints times biscotti times
gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a seed pack from him as well
that we fido hunted.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we got a lot of fire out of there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of them are staples in our garden
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and I just appreciate that you're a
hash maker running stuff indoor and
[SPEAKER_09]: hunting from seed because so many people I
know will only take in verified dumpers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know where the cut is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you have to take those losses to
understand because you could be missing
[SPEAKER_08]: out on really good turps that aren't
yielding very high.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like there's so many turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, think about Pucci's papaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: If someone skipped over that just because
it was a two percenter, we wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_08]: some crazy candy artificial turps in the
game.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually didn't know papaya.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have assumed papaya was like a six
percenter.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, papaya is horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Papaya is horrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Papaya cakes, like three percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Z.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's worth it for the flavor,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So people try to push it onto the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why you don't see much of it or
you see crosses like the GMO crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we have garlic cookies, papaya,
honey banana papaya, GMO papaya,
[SPEAKER_03]: anything vigorous, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To help kind of fill out that turp.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like how they're doing all the Z
crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because it's such a weak strain that
everyone's like, I love the turp.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to bring that turp out,
but bring the vigor of other strains into
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is shout out people like Fletcher
who are kind of actually doing it right.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And someone else that I feel like I want
to shout out is Deep East.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he gets deep into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not like, oh, here's my F1s.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm across it with this and here's my
strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: He goes deep into the genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have mad respect for him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, on his first smoke of the day,
I feel like he really talked about a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of stuff I hear on FCP about, you know,
the real breeding work is in those F2s,
[SPEAKER_09]: those F3s.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the stuff that you're unlocking later
down the line that nobody would really
[SPEAKER_08]: see, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it makes it harder for people to
replicate your work because instead of
[SPEAKER_08]: them being able to just take that strain
and cross it with the same strain,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a different, further expressed
genetic of it, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I have a lot of respect for
him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what he does, he's not just as
force as a pollen chucker, just someone
[SPEAKER_08]: that's like, oh, these are two strains I
think would do very well together.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he puts a lot of thought and
time into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then creates what the pollen chuckers
are trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like, I think a lot of what Dio
has done, people are pollen chucking their
[SPEAKER_09]: way into right now with the really fruity
sherbs.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: Minty, lavendery.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the tea kind of tastes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: His work is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any ideas?
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to, we lost a lot of it though.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had all the original Z cuts that
basically created RS11 and all the RS
[SPEAKER_08]: phenos.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had just got the permanent marker and
we lost it right before we could even grow
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, I was so sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he has permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Permanent marker?
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like it's hard to be sane,
like putting a specific number on strains
[SPEAKER_08]: like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like light, like you could say like a
plant weight, but it all comes down to the
[SPEAKER_08]: grower and the environment, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: It plays a huge role.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have a strain that you're going
to think is going to stack and be six feet
[SPEAKER_08]: tall and fucking full of nugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the person doesn't know what they're
doing and they don't know how to drive the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know how to catch a swell.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're just full of a room of
popcorn nugs, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that yes, it's a strain that
has the potential to do it, but you need
[SPEAKER_08]: to drive it correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that goes back to not just the medium,
but the people behind like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the care that is placed in the method and
your system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I'm kind of like the people
that say, oh, you're not doing living soil
[SPEAKER_08]: or you're not using, you're using salts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, it doesn't necessarily
matter of the medium or the nutrients
[SPEAKER_08]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how you use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting in the case of like
making hash because that somehow I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: you're able to get a more pure expression
than just the herb, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the herb is even to some extent
like in the way of the resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I respect people who also
grow their flower and wash it because you
[SPEAKER_08]: get the start to finish kind of idea of
the process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like as a hash maker,
you need that to really get the full idea
[SPEAKER_08]: of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you're not really doing things to
your full potential without understanding
[SPEAKER_08]: that start to finish.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so is all of your stuff single source
or do you take a material?
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of our stuff is single source.
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple, like whenever we're testing out
new strains that we really want to run,
[SPEAKER_08]: whenever we're testing out new strains
that we really want to run, we kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: source from some people if we need to.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we keep a lot of our stuff in house.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a handful of really good
cultivators that I trust with my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just love, they have the passion for
growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not because they see it as a cash
crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because they have that love for it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, it is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so do you have any requirements of
what you'll wash?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, do you need, are there certain
metrics that you, you know, if something
[SPEAKER_09]: is, if something's going to hit less than
1%, will you touch it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wash something from a buddy of mine
that I was testing out straw AC and I got
[SPEAKER_08]: 0.3 to rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and I paid for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I paid four racks for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like you win and you lose
sometimes and that's part of the game.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where those people physically
sizzle out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You burn out when you don't have that real
passion for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you really love it and like,
I'm crazy about hash, bro, so that's not
[SPEAKER_08]: going to get in my way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to keep fucking going and I'm
going to find what's going to help me out
[SPEAKER_08]: and what's going to do good for me,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And keep in mind that 0.3% wasn't even
shit I would smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just all, it was all just stocks
and bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: What bag did most of it come out of?
[SPEAKER_08]: I pulled a, well, I pull all my stuff 90
through 159 and I keep all the other stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But even just the 90 heads, it wasn't
heads, it was all stocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I pressed it, it was just like,
didn't have much turps.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that greeny kind of like nastiness,
you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: What stuff that maybe doesn't have high
numbers in terms of how well it washes but
[SPEAKER_11]: that you still run because it's amazing?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've ran into very few of them to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like one of the strains that I
really enjoy that doesn't produce enough
[SPEAKER_08]: for us to make sense to be putting it into
production per se is the Double Cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our red pop times runs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's around like 3.4% to sift,
2.9% to rosin, a little under that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't make much sense to put it
onto market because you're sitting on so
[SPEAKER_08]: much valuable product.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the turp is really pronounced.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like one of those strawberry turps
that it's like an artificial cough syrup
[SPEAKER_08]: turp.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we call it Double Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a strawberry turp?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's a red pop times runs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So red pop is strawberries and cream times
strawberry, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's super, super strawberry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, just quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you just used the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, to jazz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass it to jazz.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're passing it to him,
but you just used it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm maestro-ing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it produced amazing consistency,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just rolled up some 305 haze from Miami
straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't ask for anything better to
preserve that terroir, that microclimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the flour mill does a lot of
justice in terms of preserving the
[SPEAKER_03]: trichomes, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are these cookies called?
[SPEAKER_09]: So those cookies, while we roll up some
other stuff, and thank you for sharing so
[SPEAKER_09]: much about your brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, no worries.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here to spread the information.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is something that I'm up to with a
couple of homies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are bringing this to the rec market.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an infused cookie mix.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want you guys to eat them.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I would love for you to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check these things out.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have told me they weren't
infused and I wouldn't even know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we're super stoked on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We came up with a recipe and we use a nano
THC that really provides no cannabis taste
[SPEAKER_09]: and also when you're baking it in the
kitchen, no smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a quick onset to the nanotech.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some people are starting to
actually make smokable versions of it,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's best suited for topicals and
edibles.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it hits way faster.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pass the piff to mace.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pass the piff to mace.
[SPEAKER_09]: Max, what do you think of the cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a 305 Hayes Miami Hayes right there
for all you heads out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cookie is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's buttery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's good about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Homemade cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I can't really taste hash in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you technically one of the owners,
Gabe, of this cookie company?
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: An investor, owner, CEO.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you?
[SPEAKER_09]: So me and two other partners, one of
which, Otis, OG is my oxygen, is not here
[SPEAKER_09]: today.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other partner, Ben, is in the kitchen
making cookies right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And shout out to Ben for making these
delicious cookies today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, shout out to Ben and for putting
them in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ben's in the kitchen cooking up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he developed this recipe, which I'm so
happy that I didn't have to do because it
[SPEAKER_09]: would not be nearly this good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you know if he's infusing the butter
or is it oil?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually we're making the cookie mix,
the dry mix.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it is a nano THC alongside a
neutral carrier.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks very similar to flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a crystalline.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like crystal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're having to then just
homogenize it into the mix.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, very cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is harder, easier said than done.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting into edibles and doing mass
production.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just finished a 200,000 piece order.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fucking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's it's it's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you doing we're doing gummies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And are you using your your rosin?
[SPEAKER_08]: We weren't for this order.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just some distillate order.
[SPEAKER_08]: But down the line, we want to get a line
together of rosin edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I feel like you have to approach the
market in a certain way, because I was
[SPEAKER_08]: talking to I'm not sure if you know,
but Dank Tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the homie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, homie.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's he's he's a homie.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he sees things very far in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were chatting with him about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he just feels that either the demand
is going to be so much that you can't keep
[SPEAKER_08]: up with it, that there's not enough rosin
to really beat it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the whole idea, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was always like, you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to say, I respectfully hold a
different position because you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: you don't want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the industrialization of something
creates this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: called the standing reserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that standing reserve almost limits
the quality of like the production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always going to be like the
mythical 1% of hash, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we got to have the feed the
masses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he's understanding what is
like, yeah, it's like that right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's something convenient and
sorry to strip you of whatever you're
[SPEAKER_08]: saying and different topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But but so I don't know if you guys follow
Bloom Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Harry Palms, I appreciate I appreciate
him so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's he's he's like, way further in the
game than anybody I feel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So him and his group, they're starting to
discover my partner could talk way more
[SPEAKER_08]: about this because he's very, very like
the the triploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, have you seen about triploids?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, tell me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So so it's basically normal clones and
normal cuts of weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a they have two chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a triploid, it has three chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what it does is it affects the genetic
like stability in a sense of it that it
[SPEAKER_08]: won't be able to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, can we step back a little bit?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are these things?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they there in nature or they exist?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's existed in nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a thing since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_08]: People have been growing crops of
triploids before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just hasn't been looked looked into.
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're skunk.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's triploid skunk that people were
growing in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a that's a force of forced
mutation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or how does that work?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a natural mutation that occurs and
people people have noticed what it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been starting to study it more and
more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what is Harry doing with us?
[SPEAKER_08]: So what they've noticed is that you're
able to control THC percentage and
[SPEAKER_08]: trichome growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're saying that you could get a 300
micron trichome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine dabbing just one fucking trichome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the idea is it feels like it would be
the resin would be too heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so that's what that's their
further thought of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But so the whole idea of what they're
doing right now with it is so that they
[SPEAKER_08]: can do 100 acre crops of high yielding
hash strains and it not get fucked by the
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp fields next door that are going to
seed it with the pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason being it's not because they
want to fuck on the market of hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that they want to stop ethanol
extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: So where there's so much outdoor rosin
produced that you could be using rosin
[SPEAKER_08]: instead of distillate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he just posted not him, but his
partner 707.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just posted he's seeding a hundred
acres of crops, auto flowers that are
[SPEAKER_08]: going to high yielding hash strain auto
flowers that are going to be cut down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot when, but in a couple months.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like waiting, waiting until you
see a hundred or a 50 gallon barrel full
[SPEAKER_08]: of rosin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and in my mind that just pushes the
culture forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a lot of ways, while it might create
more mass produced hash, it also is going
[SPEAKER_09]: to set a standard that then people are
going to have to increasingly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like they're saying to the Cobbets,
people are like, why are you going to do
[SPEAKER_08]: this?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to best with the traditional
hash market or all the artisan hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an approach that is realistic and
doable.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not what they're trying to take
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want to be anywhere near like
the artisan hash or any quality kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just trying to get mass outdoor
rosin to production to where the cost is
[SPEAKER_08]: low enough so that you can cut out ethanol
extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're having a more pure
expression of the terpene and of the
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then is there also in my mind,
the one concern I'd have with that is not
[SPEAKER_09]: so much about what it would do production,
but more what it would do to turps because
[SPEAKER_09]: there are just things that don't dump and
they're turps that I like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the don't dump and then smoke and
flour over VHL.
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you like, do you care what turps
you're getting in your edibles?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they don't give a shit about that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So going with him where he's going
distillate, for example, people started
[SPEAKER_05]: distilling entire plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're talking about stock and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole leaf, the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like you said, when you're doing
edibles, you're not really focusing on the
[SPEAKER_05]: turps like at all mass production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you could do so much with it,
you know, elixirs, all this other new shit
[SPEAKER_05]: that is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that came out with VHL and
distillate is going to be, it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be like, you're going to replace it with
rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are going to go buy in the rosin
decarb pills on the shelves now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be rosin lotion,
rosin lip balm, everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And none of this has to have high amounts
of turps.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I was not thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I assumed that it was all getting smoked.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm saying is that everyone
thought that that's what they're going
[SPEAKER_08]: for, but they're saying we don't want any
part of that market.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to attack this market.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cool side of it is that with the
triploids and the auto flowering that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're messing around with, you'll be
able to chop down your harvest in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be a high yielding hash strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of that, you can, manipulate
the THC percentage and trichome size.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, there's so many benefits to
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, what are they saying in the
comments?
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like the comments will have
thoughts about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in theory, you all would have had
feelings about that, but no, it's super
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that, you know, it seems very
novel right now, but I think a lot of the
[SPEAKER_09]: crop steering stuff that's happening right
now, you know, pushing the plants like you
[SPEAKER_09]: were talking about 25 years ago,
that was, it just opens a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunity because think about the
chances that people are going to get
[SPEAKER_08]: because their crops aren't going to get
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can grow anywhere now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could grow literally anywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what markets are they mainly looking
at?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right next to Hemfields.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's literally Hemfields.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's up in Mendocino, just up North,
like literally just big farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was thinking this was like the Oklahoma
type world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the benefits of these triploids
you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it stops cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get, the plants can't get,
can't get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're saying that it can,
you're able to manipulate the vigor of the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant, THC percentage and trichome growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess I understand why,
how they would be sterile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the sterility makes sense to me with
the three chromosomes, but I guess I don't
[SPEAKER_09]: understand how.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm pausing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me grab my friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll help.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about triploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come, come inform the people.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the, he's the big brain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, I mean, I appreciate though that
you, you guys are because we're really
[SPEAKER_09]: passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I fundamentally understand why triploids
would be sterile.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand how you can then steer
the resin production.
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically the idea is it came from an
Instagram post from a 707 grows,
[SPEAKER_10]: 707 underscore grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's affiliated with Bloom seed co,
I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he predicted that the future is
basically going to be distill it free
[SPEAKER_10]: because triploids that produce like 6%
resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Auto flower triploids are going to become
the next thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So people are planning like hundreds of
acres of this and basically they're
[SPEAKER_10]: unhindered by CBD farms.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there's a farmer that has male CBD
plants right next door, it has no effect
[SPEAKER_10]: on it cause they're sterile.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that means that there's going to be a
lot of not clean, but there's going to be
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of really cheap outdoor rosin from
these auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause they're going to be dumping 6% in 60
days.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where we started was we were
talking about sort of what it would do to
[SPEAKER_09]: the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I guess what, what we're here is about
a sort of the mechanics of, I guess it is
[SPEAKER_09]: just that you have elite genetics that are
now autos and sterile.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they will dump.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing about the, that,
that steers them towards dumping or am I
[SPEAKER_09]: misunderstanding?
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what steers them towards dumping is
simply the genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be elite genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bloom seed co feminized triploids are in
the works.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll be available soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Triploids are plant varieties that have
three sets of chromosomes experience
[SPEAKER_10]: experiencing hybrid vigor slash heterosis.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes everything bigger, bigger plants,
larger, larger trichome heads,
[SPEAKER_10]: increased terpene and THC content and are
sterile.
[SPEAKER_10]: This allows farmers to the ability to
plant triploid seeds next door to an
[SPEAKER_10]: industrial hemp farm with acres of males
and not be affected as they do not accept
[SPEAKER_10]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could plant acres of hash dumpers
that aren't affected by rogue pollen,
[SPEAKER_10]: and produce kilos of, of rosin cheaper
than disti, what would be the benefit of
[SPEAKER_10]: traditional ethanol distillation?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the rosin is going to replace the
disti market in the next few years,
[SPEAKER_10]: especially when bloom seed co times
automatic genetics collabs are done and
[SPEAKER_10]: farmers are pulling 7% crops in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be game over for disti at
automatic genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an interesting vision.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, if you have the technology to
back it up, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing too is how they're
introducing the auto flowers into it,
[SPEAKER_08]: because on this other post, he's talking
about him seeding the a hundred acres.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he says that he's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to harvest the field and have
it replanted by August 1st.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had the homie last week and a
couple of weeks ago on Jeremy Norrie,
[SPEAKER_09]: who in addition to doing the secret cup
historically, now does the auto flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he's seen the evolution of early
BHO and his vision.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now of what's coming next in the market
are the autos.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think it's interesting at this
sesh where you'd expect people to not be
[SPEAKER_09]: super into autos.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because autos used to be so frowned
upon, like it was just something that
[SPEAKER_08]: people to throw on their porch would be
growing, you know, but now it's being
[SPEAKER_08]: utilized as how quick they can flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, people are like, this is going
to cut down on production time.
[SPEAKER_08]: How can we use it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and I feel like that's kind of what
the industry is stepping into is everyone
[SPEAKER_08]: taking a step back and looking at what
have we missed and how can we benefit from
[SPEAKER_08]: these things?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's a lot of little nuances
that can help a lot around the community,
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have like another example?
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, no, that's the, not to put you
on the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will come, come to mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel throughout the night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you said that there would be
applications for like edibles,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, more broadly, what the other
placements of distillate would be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, now I understand what you're saying.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about the people that are coming
into the market that are older than us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the, the stigma of being a stoner is
kind of going away.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are educating themselves on what
they can benefit from the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's, there's oil, oral base,
there's topicals, there's several things.
[SPEAKER_08]: My grandma fucking smokes a vape pen
before night for her glycoma in her eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So,
[SPEAKER_08]: no shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Minor to minor too strong for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about patches?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Patches.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of there's a, there's a lot of
menstrual stuff coming out for like women
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's really big things that people
are looking into.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so on another note, to the lady I met
who makes cannabis anal butt lube.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's fucking lube and shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's, there's support a small business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But to bring up, I feel like a thing,
another topic, like you're saying that has
[SPEAKER_08]: been on my mind is the, everyone,
everyone talks about it, but how THC
[SPEAKER_08]: percentage doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that everyone understands
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I feel like we need to start
looking more into is how the terpenes
[SPEAKER_08]: affect us because that's the biggest thing
that affects you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like think about how lavender makes
you sleepy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pepper corn makes you awake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the certain terpenes gives you
certain effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like that's, that's very,
I feel like that's very overlooked.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, I think that, yeah,
the turf education is, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: there's some strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but there's more, there's more,
there's missing out.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot that you're missing out on.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing as all the bullshit,
someone trying to explain how a strain
[SPEAKER_08]: will affect, affect you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh, it's a cerebral effect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the fuck does that mean, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do, how is it going to get me high?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the high like?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not like how's your spiritual fucking
being like, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like there's things that we can
look into with the Terps that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: actually put a pinpoint expression of what
it's going to give you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also what's like beyond the Terps,
like the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot who we were talking, we were
talking with four and here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was at green street.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was about two months ago and we had a
new strain called spoiled fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not new, but what I did was I opened
this up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like about eight people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was, there was no flowing air.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was, it was all stale.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smelled it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smelled one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got a, like the fan hit me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smelled the same exact jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smelled different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked a little bit weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked off because I was like,
dude, this doesn't smell like anything
[SPEAKER_05]: that you guys are talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is it's like 20,
30 people against me with just one person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, no, all you motherfuckers
are wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what I did was I went under the,
uh, the AC vent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I opened it again and I called everybody
back to under the vent and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: smell it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, holy shit, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over there where there's no air smells
like strawberries in front of the fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like GMO.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, sometimes like, yeah,
it might be a little knucklehead,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I had to do that just to prove my
friends that you know what I was talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to get my point across.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can pass it around,
but once again, it's a, it smells,
[SPEAKER_05]: it smells more like strawberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you put it in the fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like GMO.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're volatile.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're experiencing it firsthand
because you're fresh pressing stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, honestly though, some of those
terpenes that are volatile at room
[SPEAKER_09]: temperature are the most caustic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when I've taken dabs fresh off the
press is when I'm the most blown out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabriel off the top of my head,
when Pelé Polar brought a flavonoids
[SPEAKER_05]: versus terpenoids, I could just think of
blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, blue cheese smells a little
disgusting to me, but you dig into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all sweet and creamy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause the breakdown, the oxygen,
it's smell versus taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the whole thing with hash is
like the uniqueness is that it's stable
[SPEAKER_03]: and preserved, but it can still be like
transformed subtly over time because of
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like, if you go to a moist
environment, you go to a dry, you go to a
[SPEAKER_03]: beach, it's going to, you know,
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: What did we say?
[SPEAKER_11]: Give us Parmesan cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lactilis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some one of those like, it's not urea,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a bacterial.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's the, um, I forget what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very prominently in gelato.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that diaper term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Butric acid is what gives Parmesan cheese
its smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get technical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabinoid compounds in hash,
let alone weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as it oxidizes, it's going through
those phases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that happens with tea and wine and
other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what makes hash so special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like temple balls, five years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I learned was like, you can wash
the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very durable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you need boiling water and hit
some old hash or whatever and let it dry
[SPEAKER_03]: in the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got these unique turps break
into, you know, it's like, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a crush that preserves the inner
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are our turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, but four, four, how does that smoke?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the high doesn't last me too long,
but it is smooth as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it's the tier two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just letting you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it first wash versus second wash?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what are the tiers for you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a bit of, I don't, I hate calling
stuff tech because it's the same thing
[SPEAKER_08]: back to how I was saying about the,
I like hash makers that grow their own
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff as well because there's no tech in
hat and making hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can make cash.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be super, super harsh
because there's a lot of plant matter in
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's fire starting material,
it's going to taste fire and look fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they say tech, I think they're
just saying their process terminology
[SPEAKER_08]: process, their process, you know,
process is basically, um, we, depending on
[SPEAKER_08]: the weight of the wash and what the strain
is, cause certain strains wash way quicker
[SPEAKER_08]: than others, depending on the Nug
structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we do our second to third wash and
separate our 90 through 159 for our
[SPEAKER_08]: premium tier one, what we package,
we put our side label on top label and
[SPEAKER_08]: then our tier two, we just put a top label
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's basically our 73 through 189 U
of the later washes and the lower head and
[SPEAKER_08]: the upper heads of the first through third
wash mixed into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Word.
[SPEAKER_08]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and that's also what goes into our
pens is the tier two Raza, which I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: afraid to say because it's fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the tier two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of to the conversation we were having
earlier, because you're doing a broader
[SPEAKER_09]: range of heads, there's going to be a
broader range of experiences.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: A more spectrum of terpenes and flavonoids
to be able to taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where it comes into play is why I
don't, I, I believe in that not the 90 and
[SPEAKER_08]: upper heads are the most ripe,
the most developed trichome heads,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I don't believe in doing 90 through
one Oh three or 90 through one 20.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get as close to where there's
like 9189 or some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: 93, one 89, 93, one 59.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can get as little plant matter
through, I'll get to the biggest screen I
[SPEAKER_08]: can.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those bigger heads have such rich
sugar, like especially, especially if the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic, like, I know it's going to
control, but like a tangy, like where even
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaf has like a sweet, you know,
so that when you get those filtered,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not getting like an unwanted taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting that slight other resident
from you're getting the pure expression of
[SPEAKER_08]: what the plant wants to give you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Oliver, I'm going to be opening
up one of your jars of a garlic juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, check this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it didn't smell like garlic
juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do smell hints of garlic, but I want
your guys' opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I want everybody's opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff, stuff, stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is my buddy out in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_08]: His Mr. Auto Grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: He works closely with Bloom Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_08]: He does a lot of personal fino hunts for
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: He sent me this cut a few months ago,
this and some grape guava.
[SPEAKER_08]: The grape guava didn't do too well,
but we're going to try and get the garlic
[SPEAKER_08]: juice back because this one's a fucking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny because I have a homie who gets like
6% off the grape guava, which speaks to
[SPEAKER_09]: different finos.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, it's not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just I'm picky when it comes to those
guava crosses because I've done so many of
[SPEAKER_08]: them that I just I don't like when it's
heavy on the strawberry guava,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, because I'm tired of that guava.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the thing that sucks is we had a
really killer fino.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a strawberry bubbles.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was mimosa times strawberry guava and
we had a killer fino of it that it was
[SPEAKER_08]: straight mimosa candy and a little guava
on the back end, but it only yielded like
[SPEAKER_08]: 0.5% to rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was the best flower I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a gassy garlic juice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a common garlic juice,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, garlic juice can go super sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like it's like it's not funky papaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the gassy papaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is gassy because it smells awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're super sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're super sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the artificial papaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's funky papaya and gassy papaya,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it smell garlic to you or like a new
room?
[SPEAKER_08]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like from what you smelled in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been here many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're super gassy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It threw me off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells great, but it threw me off.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the beautiful thing about FCP.
[SPEAKER_05]: The super boop is super sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could always come smell, try,
and taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very Kush forward glue, but like the
back end has this nice floral,
[SPEAKER_03]: like sweet expression of the Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of just stains your whole like
esophagus with sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the tier one or the tier two?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tier one, baby.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, you know, I've been around a lot of
hash makers and say I don't sell jars.
[SPEAKER_09]: I sell hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you can miss me with the side wrap.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have packaging and stuff
because we're going to be packaging it
[SPEAKER_08]: this week.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all new stuff, but that would
normally come with a side wrap and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the, or I gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have the spoiled fruit jar that has
the side wrap and everything for?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just like a super, super trot
cherry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have the super booth jar with the
full wrap and everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the cross?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the cross on the super booth?
[SPEAKER_08]: The super booth is Tropicana cookies times
black cherry punch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the spoiled fruit is dosy dose
times trop cherry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Word.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it seems like
[SPEAKER_09]: it's a staple in your garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: Serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smell some of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the tier one super spoiled fruit,
spoiled fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a tier tier one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one that I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a super boo.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that I gave you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pass that around.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the tier one spoiled fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And spoiled fruit is, you said it was
dosy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dosy dose times trop cherry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's super unique because that was the
strain that four was talking about with
[SPEAKER_08]: the airflow and how it changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's super GMO-y funky dosy dose
smelling at sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on the back end, you get this
strawberry, like really sweet candy smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got to get the hash right with
the hash right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, four?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to get the hash right with the hash
right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we got second place at Kustok.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could have got first, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we got first place for our
edibles, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, man.
Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm nine in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is the right amount of cookies now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm nine in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am fated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think I would get me that high,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't eat a lot, but like 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought those for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got you one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, take one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are medicated four milligram nano
cookie.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cocoa and salts.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was our first run in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the spoiled fruit was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rockwell and then the super booth was
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the and the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you just still ran the same salt
formula.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, same salt formula and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to reintroduce.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I was saying, that was our first
run.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get crazy, crazy numbers because
we weren't expecting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We only got, I think, four and a half
percent on the super booth.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were expecting five point six because
that's what we normally get.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we had no foliars.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have any beneficials,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: So honestly, we crushed it because we got
two point two seven a light with nothing,
[SPEAKER_08]: just literally just feeding it nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited for the next few runs
because I feel like we're going to get
[SPEAKER_08]: some really good numbers out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The next room that we have coming in,
it's got a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 60 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be jealous bananas and oil
tanker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, jealous bananas, jealousy times
banana cream cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then oil tanker is motor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Motor breath times trophy wife.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have some motor, just straight
motor breath right here, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a personal friends and friends and
family batch here.
[SPEAKER_08]: One tier one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to only be releasing,
I think, six jars of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Six.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super limited.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three times two.
[SPEAKER_09]: The motor breath is heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just that straight motor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: You think I'm not down?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you got to take some gloves.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to get the full expression of the
Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super booth.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could you could glob all of them if
you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever one stood out the most to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to set up Gabriel with a nice
fat glob of some hash, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one did you?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I've tasted your hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will this be your first time taking a glob
on FCP?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I've taken gloves and not of this
hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your favorite so far that you've
smelled after this?
[SPEAKER_09]: It honestly might have been the rotten
fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm forgetting what it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: The spoiled fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that one sticks around with people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those ones that just sticks in
your head, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like for me, one of those strains is like
Mac, like caps cut Mac.
[SPEAKER_08]: That smell stays in my head, like no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's one of those strains I feel,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're more than welcome to take a
dab of whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Word.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So ask Eric what he grew this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you mostly grow at home?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you grow, Eric?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew on the farm and a little bit at
home too and a couple other spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In beds, in pots, in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some in pots, 30 gals, four by
fours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, some little, yeah, everything
all between.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you deal with those?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your IPM for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_04]: The caterpillars?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or slugs?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Slugs, they weren't bad enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really have a problem with those
in my place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then caterpillars, we did the
trichogamma wasp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we did the trichogamma, predatory
wasp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, trichogamma wasp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's a predatory insect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no sprays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you could just let them go in the
greenhouse or out in the field and they'll
[SPEAKER_04]: take care of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's super dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you grow?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like on the hut, because you also grow
hemp, but on the high seaside,
[SPEAKER_11]: what do you grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some Gary Payton, some soap,
some kush mints, some AJ's Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_04]: AJ's Cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some, what was, Ice Cream Man was
the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice Cream Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jazz, what was this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Peter Terp for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one are you firing up there for?
[SPEAKER_03]: LO.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take a dab of some hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not know the name of this brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm finally taking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Keeping it Coastal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is soil grown, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you can go, you can go.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_09]: All of Maximum.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take a dab together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it go down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's some very heady hash too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of heady hash today.
[SPEAKER_11]: The dab rig.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the quartz on the end of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: SD Dank Quartz and a Bowman Rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's definitely water in the rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just wait for the temperature to go
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not trying to kill Gabriel either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabriel, how hot do you like your dabs,
Gabe?
[SPEAKER_07]: So sorry, just back to this hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: About Keeping it Coastal.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a small boutique farm located on
the regional coast of Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to learn more about them,
there's a full review on their flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get them for free on DagaAcademy
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Daga.academy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know me, I be high.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get it, Gabe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it lower on the dish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that's a big dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it spin.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a pretty big dab right
now.
Peter,
[SPEAKER_07]: you spoke too soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: You jinxed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was clean hash, good?
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're next.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strong fruits, rotten fruits.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_09]: Spoiled fruits?
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoiled fruits, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's had more fruity on the burn.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm crying.
[SPEAKER_04]: That had a lot more fruit on the burn than
it does in the jar, you could tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm crying.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sulfur volatizes really quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You lose all of that garlic smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out to the fruit once you
pass that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, once it's cured, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's smoothed out and become a lot
more enjoyable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the beauties of the frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to capture all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then after the whip, man, the art of
the whip, you got to...
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a big dab.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was proper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good off like 0.5, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not supposed to take dabs that big.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the largest and hottest dab I've
ever seen Gabe take.
[SPEAKER_09]: Might have been.
[SPEAKER_09]: 0.5 I think is my biggest, biggest.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was getting ninja dabbed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what was your favorite thing that
you ran this year?
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you running this coming season?
[SPEAKER_04]: This coming season, we got a whole bunch
of, gosh, all the some mint stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as like seed, pheno popping,
I'm going for some kind of older green gas
[SPEAKER_04]: crosses, like some chem stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some OG crosses that are just green to
green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a lot of lemon crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been, as I travel around
everywhere I go, I've been asking
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody for what they have in the lemon
realms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've collected a handful of lemon
packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got, you know, like a dozen or
more people's lemon crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find a keeper in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like I've got a bunch of,
you know, just a bunch of guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: lemons, lemon lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are you looking forward to to pop
in the most out of those lemon packs?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Flying Lion Research, Sean,
he gave me a lemon hash plant on lemon
[SPEAKER_04]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one that I just saw the other day
that looks really fun to go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got a Hawaiian Bud Lines from
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're citrus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like it has so much citrus in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not truly lemon, but that's in
the citrus world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might get something that kind of leans
that way, but had like all the citrus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, Russell Cha Genetics just
gave me a couple of his lemon crosses that
[SPEAKER_04]: he was doing because he had a lemon hash
plant, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, oh, Jake from 808 Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave me some lemon peels or he had a
bunch of different lemon things,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is like a lemon macaroons to lemon
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that that should be a fun, fun one to
go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, like I said, there's just a
bunch of lemons in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eric, we all got kind of high and we
glossed over it, but if you want to just
[SPEAKER_07]: introduce yourself real quick to the
crowd, to people who don't know you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, in the car, I brought up some some
seeds and some CBD and some fertilizer as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm Eric with Organics Alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we we do all organic nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been able to come out with a soluble
organic nutrient that will, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: totally run through all your irrigation
systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, we've got supplements and
everything you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole organic fertilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fertilizing line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish Otis was here to talk about how we
used it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were really happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, you know, going down the turf
profile and into that world, you
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely, you know, your inputs matter,
you know, and so you want to get.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to I want to send the whole line
up to a grower who's going to go on
[SPEAKER_11]: YouTube and we can do like watch them do a
grow along with all your just running your
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what, you know, it's all about
getting it, getting the fertilizer in the
[SPEAKER_04]: growers hands to get the content.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I feel like you're always doing sort
of R&D and looking towards the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you working on right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, an organic micronutrient so we
can get into like a true organic
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponic system is going to be going to
be next.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so in organic, you could effectively
drip feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Effectively drip feed into cubes or into,
you know, DWC or into, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrotent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Key is solubility and stability,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we're working through that and a
true organic cow mag that's soluble as
[SPEAKER_04]: well that can be passed through.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are a couple of things we're
working on right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any community against calling
liquids like organic or anything like
[SPEAKER_05]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any community against calling liquids
organic?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, even though they're organic,
like fertilizers and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like I like the concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, yeah, you have liquid
organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, our FPF is 100 percent organic,
non GMO organically stabilized,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically food grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so that's our our fermented
grains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has fulvic acid, amino acids,
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the key right there is the aminos and
the fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm a huge fan of anything that's
easier to keep the grow clean,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, instead of using soil all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this, you know, what the FPF supplies
is powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of energy for the plant from the
fermented grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about the organic growing
style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this tier two?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's probably got some.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said this is like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super smooth for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they do some indoor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't tell you specifically,
but I think they mostly do like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping it coastal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very talented.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tier two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of like the true best examples of
terroir, as I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_07]: they grow literally on the coast right
above the water.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is someone else's jar.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that is the brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's your boys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's on the same level.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a handy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, you know, multi-tool.
