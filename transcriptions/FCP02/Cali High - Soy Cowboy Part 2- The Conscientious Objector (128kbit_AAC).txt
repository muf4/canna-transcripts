[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Church of Cali High,
Cali High, Cali High, YOW!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Cali High Episode 68,
Soy Cowboy Part 2, The Conscientious
[SPEAKER_00]: Objector After enlisting in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Navy and spending a year at the Naval Air
Technical Training Center in Millington,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tennessee, I managed to get stationed
close to home at the Naval Air Station
[SPEAKER_00]: Point Magoo's Search and Rescue Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there, I put a band together with
three friends and three female Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: background singers.
[SPEAKER_00]: During my fourth year in the Navy and a
few years with the band, I got orders to a
[SPEAKER_00]: munitions ship that would be going to the
First Gulf War.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this turn of events unacceptable
according to what I believed and applied
[SPEAKER_00]: for discharge as a Conscientious Objector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode has been one of the most
difficult to write and read due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: heaviness of the material and so I tried
not to edit that heaviness out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This story deals with internal struggles
in the band and a personal relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: that developed as well as my ordeal with
the United States Navy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years after that first Soy Cowboy
performance at KCRW, I was still in the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Navy and enlisted man with the rank of
E-5, Aviation Electronics Technician
[SPEAKER_00]: Second Class Nicoletti.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year before, I had graduated from the
University of La Verne with a bachelor's
[SPEAKER_00]: degree in business management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly, I had thought about my
possibilities as an officer in the Navy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But due to my age of 32, only cryptology
was open to me and I would be taught
[SPEAKER_00]: Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't into Russian or cryptology,
even though I do love languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other significant events were
developing in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said in episode 64, relationships
developed in the band and let me
[SPEAKER_00]: reiterate, it is not good to be involved
with band members of the opposite sex
[SPEAKER_00]: because if the relationship falls apart,
someone will have to leave the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our cases, it wasn't the guys that
left which meant new background singers
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to be found and auditioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I must now confess to being the
first to have a relationship with one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a Soy Cowboy rehearsal at my mom's
garage one day, I asked Candy out to lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: and somehow that took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had an apartment on Serrano in
Hollywood and I began spending nights
[SPEAKER_00]: there and driving to work 60 miles to
Point Magoo in the mornings and 60 miles
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the evenings in my VW van.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band played new gigs and I was writing
more songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my relationship with Candy began
to hinder the smooth functioning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: band as Candy developed a sense of
diva-ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: At performances, she had a commanding
stage presence, setting her apart from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had experience as a singer and some
notoriety in the local Thai community.
[SPEAKER_00]: At times, she would carry on a bit of
banter on stage with Joe, who by this time
[SPEAKER_00]: had fully embraced his role as the band's
frontman and who by now was usually
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing a cowboy hat and boots,
making him appear taller than his six foot
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as evidenced by that first show on
KCRW, Joe had developed a stick around his
[SPEAKER_00]: brand of Thai western exotica and was at
times quite humorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But underneath the humorous banter between
Joe and Candy, there was tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the way to a gig one time, Candy
decided she was hungry and had to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some pad thai at a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the whole band was waiting for us,
we got to the gig about 45 minutes late
[SPEAKER_00]: and what was left of the crowd was
restless and the rest of the band was
[SPEAKER_00]: furious.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year into the band's progression from
that first KCRW gig, opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tersame Dandwar Singh, the famous
director, then a student at Art Center
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasadena, approached us about making a
video of lily pads and rock cod as his
[SPEAKER_00]: graduation project from the film
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had enlisted a whole crew of other Art
Center students to help him.
[SPEAKER_03]: However,
[SPEAKER_00]: my relationship with Candy was full of
sound and fury and on weekends we would go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Thai temple in North Hollywood
called Wat Thai and get food and hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we frequently fought over my autonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't want me going anywhere without
her, which I found not acceptable as a
[SPEAKER_00]: condition for a normal relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, ironically, I married her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, when I enlisted in the Navy,
I had signed up for six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midway through the fourth year,
after having been working at the search
[SPEAKER_00]: and rescue unit at Point Magoo helping
save lives, I was given orders to a
[SPEAKER_00]: munitions ship based in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when George Bush Sr. was making
plans to invade Kuwait and Iraq to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: Saddam Hussein's aggression there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A munitions ship is a cargo ship that
stores all the bombs and missiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: My helicopter would be loading those
munitions onto other ships, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: aircraft carriers, which essentially would
be assisting in killing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a 180 degree turn from a search and
rescue unit where my efforts were saving
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the while, Soy Cowboy's set list
was growing as we wrote more songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day Chaz called me up and told me he
had come up with the framework of a song
[SPEAKER_00]: he thought would work for the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over to his place and he had come
up with a rhythm track featuring acoustic
[SPEAKER_00]: and slide guitars.
[SPEAKER_00]: From his living room in Studio City
overlooking the valley, we started jamming
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up with the piano part and the
arrangement jelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recorded it and a new rhythm track was
born.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went home with the cassette of the rough
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the piano were some postcards from
Chiang Mai, a city in the north of
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company that made the postcards was
called Artcard Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made high quality postcards with
beautiful photos of life in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a postcard of poppies being
milked somewhere on a hillside in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Triangle, an area in northern
Thailand that borders Laos and Burma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one of monks walking down a
street in their orange robes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of a mountain sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one of elephants and one of
Hmong children in a hill tribe village
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stirred memories of dark intrigue and
dangerous adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The song became postcards from Chiang Mai
and was the only song Chaz, whose real
[SPEAKER_00]: name is Charles Polichek, wrote for the
band and remains one of the most iconic
[SPEAKER_00]: Soy Cowboy tunes to this day with no Thai
parts at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to my orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I didn't want any part of the
loading of bombs, missiles and ammunition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seed of an idea began to form in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would become a conscientious objector as
a Buddhist on the grounds of bad karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, there was only one
conscientious objector lawyer in Los
[SPEAKER_00]: Angeles, and after speaking with him,
he wouldn't take my case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called Kenny Miller, the band's first
manager, who was in law school at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and he said he didn't think it could
be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my convictions were just and my
intentions sincere, and so I refused to be
[SPEAKER_00]: discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the days following, I went to the law
library on base and read every previous
[SPEAKER_00]: case of conscientious objection from all
branches of the service.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were applications from Christians of
various denominations, Mormons and Jews,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no Buddhists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application for conscientious
objection involved writing responses to
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and then sitting for interviews
with various naval officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Navy chaplain, the Navy psychiatrist,
the judge African general, commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as a JAG, who was the Navy
lawyer, the base commander, who was a full
[SPEAKER_00]: bird captain, and my immediate supervisor,
Don O'Shalene, who, as I mentioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 64, was a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote the application and gave it to
personnel about a month after having
[SPEAKER_00]: received orders to the munitions ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application put a halt to my transfer
and, unfortunately, the advance I had
[SPEAKER_00]: received to move to San Diego where the
ship was based, would have to be paid back
[SPEAKER_00]: before my time at Point Magoo was up in
case my application was successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be subtracted from my salary,
leaving me with no pay until it was paid
[SPEAKER_00]: off, which essentially meant that my Navy
paychecks were a thing of the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meant Candy and I would have to move
out of the apartment on Serrano.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would clandestinely move her into my
barracks room and hope no one found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily at the time I had no roommate and
it was a large room as barracks go with
[SPEAKER_00]: three beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When word of my application broke around
Sarahilo, half of the guys were asking me,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you mean by karma?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other half were telling me,
right on Nicoletti, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time I was driving down to
Charmley Park, a little north of Zuma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great place for meditating,
hiking, and reading a book I bought at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi Tree Bookshop in Hollywood called
The Buddha and His Teachings by a monk
[SPEAKER_00]: named Narada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chapter on karma became my favorite,
not just because my application involved
[SPEAKER_00]: karma as a reason for my conscientious
objection, but because it broke karma down
[SPEAKER_00]: into various categories and explained the
various aspects of actions in life as they
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally I took one hit of weed at
the beginning of the weekend because drug
[SPEAKER_00]: testing was random in the Navy and there
was always the possibility of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: busted on a pee test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hit was, however, very therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those afternoons alone in Charmley Park
sitting on a rock amidst the grass and
[SPEAKER_00]: trees with a view of the ocean below were
beautiful and poignant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were grounding and had a way of
putting me in touch with my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the last month on Serrano,
Candy and I moved out of the apartment and
[SPEAKER_00]: put some things in storage and then I
moved her into the barracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room was close to an exit and the
building itself was quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We managed to pull it off for about a
month and then one day while I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: down at the Sar-Hilo hangar, there was an
inspection of the rooms by a Master Chief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine the expression on his
face when he opened the door and found
[SPEAKER_00]: Candy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got back to the barracks after
work, Candy told me what had happened and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a note to go see the Master
Chief who, as it turned out, was a kindly
[SPEAKER_00]: Filipino guy and he politely told me that
I had to move Candy out of the barracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't write me up or assign any
punishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right around this time we found out
Candy was pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told my mom about the turn of events and
she told Leslie, our next door neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I knew, Leslie had offered
to loan me her Toyota camper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a small pickup truck with a camper
mounted on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a bathroom, a mini fridge,
a sink and a stove and the bed was over
[SPEAKER_00]: the cab of the truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of cozy, a little cramped,
but Candy and I managed to make it home
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night I'd pull into the Navy Credit
Union parking lot and plug in to an
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical outlet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were RV stations down toward the
beach on base and we could empty the
[SPEAKER_00]: wastewater and fill up with fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lasted for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an adventure, like camping
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 1989 and during this time I started
being interviewed about my application for
[SPEAKER_00]: conscientious objection.
[SPEAKER_00]: First was the Navy Chaplain who has a
religious mission in the Navy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Navy Chaplain asked me about my
Buddhist beliefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had originally done my readings at
the law library on base, I noticed many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous applicants had letters from
clergy testifying to their veracity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had had years of association with the
Thai temple in North Hollywood and knew a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of the monks personally even before I
met Candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had formed a team with Ed Stone who was
my mentor in the early days of Thai
Buddhism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Thailand and we competed at
tournaments at Wat Thai as the temple was
[SPEAKER_00]: called to cross a game like volleyball but
played with the feet and the ball was made
[SPEAKER_00]: from woven cane strips resembling a soccer
ball about six inches in diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is played over a five foot high net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at Wat Thai, I had taken a Thai
language class for foreigners and I won a
[SPEAKER_00]: trophy for being the top student.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that class I met two guys, Jim
Fittipaldi and Michael Dietrich who were
[SPEAKER_00]: fans of Soy Cowboy and who became close
friends after that class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Dietrich was and is an animator
who drew many iconic flyers for the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years later he won a few Emmys,
one for Phineas and Ferb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Fittipaldi was an artist who held
events and parties at his large loft
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown off Malina Street near the fourth
street bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was putting my application
together I asked Somana, an English
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking monk of Pakistani descent,
if the abbot who did not speak English
[SPEAKER_00]: would write me a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somana talked to the abbot and he asked me
to give them a framework for a letter and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would add to it and the abbot would
sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I sat across from the chaplain I
noticed he had the letter from the abbot
[SPEAKER_00]: in my file.
[SPEAKER_00]: I explained to him while having been born
into a Catholic family I always believed
[SPEAKER_00]: in karma which was basically a summation
of all of one's actions good or bad and
[SPEAKER_00]: then having married a Buddhist after I
joined the military my beliefs in Buddhist
[SPEAKER_00]: tenets had become stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him working at Sarhila was in line
with my beliefs because I was helping save
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, working on a munitions
ship preparing for war was totally against
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, helping any war effort was
not right action according to the Buddhist
[SPEAKER_00]: eight-fold path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go too much further allow me to
outline some of the qualifying criteria
[SPEAKER_00]: for applicants according to the Armed
Services directives.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, burden of proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applicants bear the burden of proving
their claims of conscientious objection as
[SPEAKER_00]: grounds for separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must show by clear and convincing
evidence that their belief is honest
[SPEAKER_00]: sincere and deeply held.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, applicants proof of moral and ethical
beliefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applicants must show that moral and
ethical beliefs are against participation
[SPEAKER_00]: in war of any form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, a primary factor to be considered is
the sincerity with which the belief is
[SPEAKER_00]: held.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great care must be exercised in
determining whether asserted beliefs are
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly and genuinely held.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sincerity is determined by a partial
evaluation of the applicant's thinking and
[SPEAKER_00]: living in its totality past and present.
[SPEAKER_00]: B, care must be exercised in determining
the integrity of belief and the
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: C, information presented by applicants
should be convincing enough that their
[SPEAKER_00]: personal history reveals views and actions
strong enough to demonstrate the belief in
[SPEAKER_00]: which the conscientious objection is based
is the primary controlling force in his or
[SPEAKER_00]: her life and that expediency or avoidance
of military service is not the basis of
[SPEAKER_00]: their claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And D, the conduct of the applicant in
particular his or her outward
[SPEAKER_00]: manifestation of the beliefs asserted will
be carefully examined and given
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial weight in evaluating the
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Navy guidelines also state that after
the interview the chaplain will submit a
[SPEAKER_00]: written report including the chaplain's
opinion as to the nature and basis of the
[SPEAKER_00]: applicant's claim and sincerity and depth
of conviction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chaplain's report must also include
reasons for the conclusions contained
[SPEAKER_00]: within the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had submitted a clear and well-written
application which addressed these issues
[SPEAKER_00]: of belief, history and development of
belief in my current life demonstrating
[SPEAKER_00]: adherence to my belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of the questions to answer on the
application were what do you believe about
[SPEAKER_00]: participation in war?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, how did your beliefs develop and when
did they become incompatible with the
[SPEAKER_00]: military?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, how does your life reflect those
beliefs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next few months the Navy
psychiatrist interviewed me to check my
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Navy JAG interviewed me so to see if
he could poke any holes in my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly the captain of the base
interviewed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an understanding man and during the
interview wasn't condescending in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: His questions were much the same as anyone
else's and pertained to verifying the
[SPEAKER_00]: sincerity of my application.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the captain's interview was done I
felt a sense of closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fairly certain my application would
be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music.
[SPEAKER_00]: In October of 89 I was informed that my
application was indeed successful and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was to be discharged in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 13th day of December 1989 I was
honorably discharged from the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States Navy and awarded a certificate of
honest and faithful service along with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good conduct medal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a quiet affair at personnel and
having been honorably discharged I
[SPEAKER_00]: remained with all benefits intact.
Music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never regretted my time in the Navy
especially working at Sar-Hilo Point Magoo
[SPEAKER_00]: with such outstanding people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me first shout out to Senior Chief Don
O'Shalene, a great supervisor and a very
[SPEAKER_00]: cool human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned in episode 64 he helped me
with some difficult troubleshooting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: intercom of one of the H-46s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an avionics tech as well with many
years of experience on the helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He approved every reasonable request I had
such as appearing live on KCRW in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of a workday.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great guy who had a sense of humor that
was at times insightful and at other times
[SPEAKER_00]: full of irony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember reading him one of my essays
written during my undergraduate studies in
[SPEAKER_00]: business management.
Music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a pilot Lieutenant Commander
Asen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a Vietnam era helicopter pilot who
could be seen wandering through the
[SPEAKER_00]: offices in our hangar collecting aluminum
cans out of trash bins for recycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the ranking officer at Sar-Hilo and
yet somehow you knew he was never going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make commander and yet so did he I
believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Asen drove a 1960 Ford Falcon Ranchero
and it was one of our best pilots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Chudzinski, one of the rescue
swimmers and a friend of mine with whom I
[SPEAKER_00]: am still in touch related the story about
a flight he was on with the Lieutenant
[SPEAKER_00]: Commander piloting one Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were about a hundred miles out from
Point Magoo when a filter chip indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: popped yellow with a hint of red on one of
the transmissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a transmission fails on a helicopter
the rotor sees up and the helicopter drops
[SPEAKER_00]: like a stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asen wanted to put the helicopter down in
the water but Mike was sure he didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: the embarrassment of having to be rescued
by the Coast Guard and so he talked Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asen into flying low and slow back to
Point Magoo and somehow they made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was the hot shot Annapolis grad
Lieutenant J.P.
[SPEAKER_00]: McCann.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a partier, a good pilot and your
all-American type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being weightless once in the
back of the helicopter with McCann at the
[SPEAKER_00]: stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had friends as well who worked with me
most of whom were rescue swimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more of a runner and I got a whole
group of them running up to the radar
[SPEAKER_00]: towers with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would take two cars to the top and
leave one there and drive back down in my
[SPEAKER_00]: VW van and park next to a farmhouse and
run up the road to the towers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radar towers are on the northern tip
of the Santa Monica Mountains overlooking
[SPEAKER_00]: the base below and the Pacific Ocean to
the south and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Darlington and Joe Hollinsworth were
two of the rescue swimmers who became my
[SPEAKER_00]: good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe used to come into town with me in the
early days of scouting for singers and we
[SPEAKER_00]: stayed at my mom's house after nights
spent eating Thai food and drinking beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill was the guy who originally started
jogging with me to the radar towers and
[SPEAKER_00]: who convinced the rest of the guys to come
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still in touch to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must also thank the civilian women who
worked in the admin offices of the hangar
[SPEAKER_00]: and who took care of paperwork for the
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one who taught me how to use a
word processor so I could get my
[SPEAKER_00]: assignments done while I was working on my
undergraduate classes at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: La Verne's on-base extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use their computers to write my CO
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the day of my discharge, Kenny Miller,
my friend who had now become a lawyer and
[SPEAKER_00]: who was the band's first manager,
sublet me his upstairs back house on
[SPEAKER_00]: Castor by Ventura and Sherman Oaks and
Candy and I moved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soy Cowboys stayed together until 1993 and
briefly got back together for the second
[SPEAKER_00]: album in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tarsain made the video of Lily Pads and
Rock Cod in 1990 and then in 1991 went on
[SPEAKER_00]: to direct the video for Losing My
Religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: by REM and won the 1991 MTV award for best
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still makes commercials to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have seen one recently about a
Trojan horse being rejected and falling
[SPEAKER_00]: off a cliff after being unmasked by the IT
lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also made a few feature-length films,
one with Jennifer Lopez in 2000 called The
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: An Englishman named Caruso Fuller signed
us to what turned out to be a bad record
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little did we know his record company
based in England had known distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: and his main goal was to sell us to a big
label, something that never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were happy to get advances and
somehow overlooked the clause giving
[SPEAKER_00]: Caruso the rights to the songs for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We since have recovered those rights and
would appreciate it if you stream Soy
[SPEAKER_00]: Cowboy 24-7-365.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the recording of the first album,
Candy got into an argument with Joe and
[SPEAKER_00]: got herself kicked out of the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt curiously relieved and knew our
marriage was going to be the next thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Candy and I have an amazing son,
Andrew, who is now 33 and living in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Candy left the band, a friend of
Priña's named Sarah joined the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time she worked as a waitress at
Lanatai Restaurant on Van Nuys near
[SPEAKER_00]: Ventura Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarah was the tallest of our background
singers and somehow ended up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the tallest guy in the
band, Joe, which lasted about a year or
[SPEAKER_00]: two and didn't end well either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim had a brief fling with Leela,
which blossomed on a NorCal tour and
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't last long, especially after Tim met
Leela's husband, who we knew nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and who luckily knew nothing about
Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turned out in the end, I wasn't the
only guy in the band that violated the
[SPEAKER_00]: sane policy of no relationships with band
members.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the only guy in the band that
violated the policy of no relationships
with band members.
