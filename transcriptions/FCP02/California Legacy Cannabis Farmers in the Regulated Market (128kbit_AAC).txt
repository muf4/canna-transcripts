[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes When you wake up And you feel like
you need a little up When you're down and
[SPEAKER_02]: out And you need to get a little higher If
you feel like you need a blessing And you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel a little high today Welcome to the
church of Cali High Cali High Cali High
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Cali High Episode 53 I'm your
host Chenzo Nico And this week our guest
[SPEAKER_00]: is Michael Katz Executive Director of the
Mendocino Cannabis Alliance Considering
[SPEAKER_00]: recent media reports Which have described
a collapsing cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: California Due to over taxation We reach
out to Mendocino Cannabis Alliance's
[SPEAKER_00]: Executive Director Michael Katz For an
update on this potentially devastating
[SPEAKER_00]: news We find out why the cannabis
community of Legacy Farmers in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California Are up in arms about
cultivation and excise taxes And other
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges they face We talk about the
Equity Grant Program And the difficulties
[SPEAKER_00]: it is having Due to mismanagement and
understaffing in Mendocino County Katz has
[SPEAKER_00]: many years of experience in the cannabis
industry And the PR industry as well And
[SPEAKER_00]: is the MCA's first full-time Executive
Director Okay, Cali High is blessed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: here with Michael Katz Of the Mendocino
Cannabis Alliance How are you Michael?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks so much for having me
It's great to have you man And thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: appearing So, first question Who is the
Mendocino Cannabis Alliance?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, so the Mendocino Cannabis Alliance
Is the premier cannabis trade association
[SPEAKER_05]: in Mendocino County It was founded in 2019
Coming together of two different trade
[SPEAKER_05]: groups in Mendocino One that was focused
primarily on Business development,
[SPEAKER_05]: economic development And getting the
Mendocino name out into the world As far
[SPEAKER_05]: as quality of products And branding and
marketing And the other one was focused
[SPEAKER_05]: more on Local and state policy advocacy
efforts And so those two organizations
[SPEAKER_05]: combined to form MCA in 2019 I was
fortunate enough to have moved to
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendocino in 2018 And been involved as a
founding board member in that organization
[SPEAKER_05]: And then came on as full-time Executive
Director in November of 2020 We represent
[SPEAKER_05]: over 130 individual small businesses The
vast majority of which are licensed small
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis cultivators Here in Mendocino But
we also have members who are in other
[SPEAKER_05]: sectors We represent several retailers and
distributors Folks throughout the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: supply chain And folks who want to see our
cannabis community Survive and thrive in
[SPEAKER_05]: this challenging time So we have great
members, we have great sponsors Who help
[SPEAKER_05]: to support our efforts And we're fortunate
to be able to have a full-time Executive
[SPEAKER_05]: Director Which is me, working to advocate
on behalf of our members Because there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot going on And it's hard for folks who
are farming And who are involved in the
[SPEAKER_05]: other challenging parts of the cannabis
business To focus on all of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: at once Yeah, I hear you And the reason
we're talking today is pretty much taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get to that in a minute So now
you're the Mendocino Cannabis Alliance
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the Mendocino Cannabis Program?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Mendocino Cannabis Program is the
county department That administers the
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendocino Cannabis Program Which is the
program through which Our licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: operators have been entering into
compliance So the program opened and
[SPEAKER_05]: extended Accepted applications from people
who had previously Been cultivating
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis throughout the county And then
those operators have been in this
[SPEAKER_05]: application gauntlet Since then,
four years, four and a half years,
[SPEAKER_05]: many of them Still trying to get to a
county annual permit But the program has
[SPEAKER_05]: changed departments several times It began
in ag They were accepting paper
[SPEAKER_05]: applications at that time Then it moved to
planning And building services And in
[SPEAKER_05]: that, there was a lot of lost applications
And people having to submit four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: times the same paperwork And so this is
the latest iteration of how the county is
[SPEAKER_05]: managing cannabis And it has been made
into a standalone department And so they
[SPEAKER_05]: are kind of in charge of administering the
cannabis program On behalf of the board of
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisors Right, okay So we're going to
come back to them But let's go on to last
[SPEAKER_00]: week So last week there was a protest in
Sacramento To bring attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain on farmers in the industry in
general Caused by the, what, cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: tax and tax in general, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, so it was, the rally last week was
put on Primarily by Supernova Women Which
[SPEAKER_05]: is an equity advocacy group based out of
the Bay Area And we, as MCA, were able to
[SPEAKER_05]: participate because Origins Council,
who is our state level advocacy
[SPEAKER_05]: organization Made up of trade associations
from six different heritage cultivating
[SPEAKER_05]: regions Was a part of organizing,
but at the lead of Supernova Women And so
[SPEAKER_05]: there were two primary requests at the
rally last week One was a removal of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation tax And one was a removal of
the excise tax for equity retailers
[SPEAKER_05]: Throughout the state And so those are,
there are two areas Where we see extensive
[SPEAKER_05]: taxation That does not occur in the
unlicensed market That is really putting
[SPEAKER_05]: the licensed market behind And at a
competitive disadvantage And so the equity
[SPEAKER_05]: community, the people of color And the
BIPOC community who have struggled
[SPEAKER_05]: severely At the hands of the war on drugs
Have a lot in common in that arena With
[SPEAKER_05]: the small operators who have been subject
to the war on drugs As cultivators in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern California region You know,
Humboldt and Mendocino have some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: most Examples of paramilitary activity
Towards the eradication of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_05]: state And so, you know- Ongoing to this
day?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ongoing, you know, sadly And so there is,
you know There's still a lot of issues to
[SPEAKER_05]: be worked out But it was, it was very
uplifting And inspiring to see these
[SPEAKER_05]: communities come together At the state
capital And call for this essential tax
[SPEAKER_00]: change together And so for our listeners
Can you just tell us How much is the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators tax per ounce?
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, per pound of cannabis It's
about a dollar, it's about $160 A little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit over $160 per pound And that went up
just this, when the new year started It
[SPEAKER_05]: went up from what was about $150 To $155 a
pound And so that tax is actually tied to
[SPEAKER_05]: inflation And whereas a year ago When,
or more than a year ago When it was being
[SPEAKER_05]: considered To implement that increase of
tax It was not increased This year,
[SPEAKER_05]: the increase went ahead And so
unfortunately Because of the corresponding
[SPEAKER_05]: market crash What it means right now is
that That tax of $160 Which maybe that
[SPEAKER_05]: used to be on product That was selling for
anywhere At $1,000 a pound or over You
[SPEAKER_05]: know, so that's still a 15 You know,
15 to 20% tax right there Has now shifted
[SPEAKER_05]: to since product is available Is selling
on the market for between $300 and $500 In
[SPEAKER_05]: some cases, we're looking at a 50% tax On
that product And so that's unsustainable
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be unsustainable in any industry
But it's particularly unsustainable In
[SPEAKER_05]: light of all the other fees And licensing
requirements That are put upon these
[SPEAKER_05]: operators And specifically in Mendocino
County None of these cultivators have
[SPEAKER_05]: sites larger than 10,000 square feet So
it's the smallest of the small cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: That is still being treated Like the
largest of the large And they don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: the resources And they don't have the
runway To, you know, weight this out Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't take into account The law
of supply and demand On the price with the
[SPEAKER_05]: tax So it's just a fixed tax Yes,
and that's a challenge For us in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_05]: as well In our local tax ordinance We have
guaranteed minimum requirements Owe to the
[SPEAKER_05]: county annually And so, you know If you
have a 10,000 square foot permit But
[SPEAKER_05]: you're only cultivating 5,000 square feet
You're still responsible To pay the full
[SPEAKER_05]: minimum tax On the 10,000 square feet
Whether or not you are even Able to sell
[SPEAKER_05]: that product Whether that product
experiences crop loss That tax is just
[SPEAKER_05]: required To participate in the program But
the payment of that tax Has not resulted
[SPEAKER_05]: in any real services or support For the
folks who have been paying it And is there
[SPEAKER_00]: any other agricultural product That has a
cultivator tax?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we're aware of, no Yeah,
and Okay, that's kind of Unfair,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so the excise tax then Is also URIX
asking for that To be removed as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the excise tax is interesting
Because it comes at the end of the supply
[SPEAKER_05]: chain But it has to be paid Before the
product actually is sold Right So when a
[SPEAKER_05]: distributor Is transferring a product to a
retailer They're responsible to pay in
[SPEAKER_05]: advance This 15% excise tax And it's
either based on a complicated formula If
[SPEAKER_05]: it's wholesale pricing Or a slightly less
complicated formula If it's retail pricing
[SPEAKER_05]: But it breaks down to roughly a wholesale
product Is going to be marked up 27% To
[SPEAKER_05]: cover the excise tax And the price at
retail Wines up being marked up about 15%
[SPEAKER_05]: But the result of this And all of these
taxes That we're talking about Wind up
[SPEAKER_05]: with prices to the consumer That are,
you know 30% to 50% higher Than they're
[SPEAKER_05]: paying In the unregulated market And so
when we're guessing Or estimating That
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe there are, you know Eight or nine
illicit shops Compared to one licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: shop And those options are providing Way
discounted prices With products that to
[SPEAKER_05]: uneducated consumers Just look like
licensed cannabis products You're putting
[SPEAKER_05]: the licensed community At an incredible
disadvantage Especially when the intent of
[SPEAKER_05]: Prop 64 As it was voted in by the people
of California Was to provide a sustainable
[SPEAKER_05]: transition For these existing businesses
And to create a California cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry Of small and medium sized
businesses Right now instead what we're
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing Is an extinction event After
extinction event Of these smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses And if there's not drastic
measures Taken soon at the county and
[SPEAKER_05]: state levels We're going to see a lot more
people Have to leave the licensed market
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black market is thriving At least
it is down here I've got to tell you In
[SPEAKER_00]: the course of my job I've tried to get
interviews With some of these people
[SPEAKER_00]: There's illegal distro warehouses Where
there's thousands of pounds moving With
[SPEAKER_05]: several different distributors Sure,
well first I'd just like to recommend
[SPEAKER_05]: Words are so impactful these days We tend
to try to not use the term black market
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we find that it contributes
actually To a culture of white supremacy
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the idea that black market Bad,
white market good So terms like illicit
[SPEAKER_05]: market Unregulated market, traditional
market Just as a general word choice I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cross that out of my question
Illicit market Yeah, illicit, traditional,
[SPEAKER_05]: unregulated But yeah, the truth is that
The unregulated market Has a fraction of
[SPEAKER_05]: the Restrictions and bottlenecks That are
placed on folks in the licensed market And
[SPEAKER_05]: as you point out There have been articles
that have come out About these so-called
[SPEAKER_05]: burner distros Where folks full well are
operating businesses That are not
[SPEAKER_05]: intending to be compliant And ultimately
potentially impacting Small operators who
[SPEAKER_05]: are Because as we know As you may know
It's the distributor who's responsible For
[SPEAKER_05]: remitting the cultivation tax From the
small farmer to the state So if a
[SPEAKER_05]: distributor is operating Illegally and not
remitting that taxation Ultimately that
[SPEAKER_05]: can come back To harm the small operator
And from the articles That have been out
[SPEAKER_05]: there It seems that this is There's
awareness That this is happening But
[SPEAKER_05]: there's very little being done To stop it
And so we have been Advocating for more
[SPEAKER_05]: And more direct access opportunities For
our small farmers Not to have to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through this Very convoluted, expensive
And unreliable supply chain And be able
[SPEAKER_05]: like any other small Farmer in any other
crop Or industry or sector To be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: sell directly to consumers What they're
cultivating Small cannabis farmers Any
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis farmer who can't afford To set up
a retail license Is basically unable to
[SPEAKER_05]: Receive the full value Of their product at
market They are by necessity required To
[SPEAKER_05]: work through this entire supply chain That
separates them from The consumer and
[SPEAKER_05]: separates them From the value that they're
producing And it's creating this This
[SPEAKER_00]: untenable and unsustainable situation
Yeah, well wineries Can sell directly to
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer You go to a wine tasting
event At the winery And you can buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: wine Right there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure Yeah, sorry about that Rural living
It's okay I just kept rolling What the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell I'll edit that out later I'm back
Yeah, I was just kind of like Throwing out
[SPEAKER_00]: that rhetorical question I mean California
wouldn't put up With an illicit alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: market, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, well I mean I think that it is
important to note That we are still at the
[SPEAKER_05]: very beginning Of the end of cannabis
prohibition Like cannabis prohibition
[SPEAKER_05]: exists We are not outside of that paradigm
Just because we have a state regulated
[SPEAKER_05]: program It's still not legal in any
Meaningful sense I mean there have been
[SPEAKER_05]: reductions In criminal charges that can be
filed But that has not solved the problem
[SPEAKER_05]: Of people of color being incarcerated At
greater numbers Because of cannabis Than
[SPEAKER_05]: not And so we're still not seeing The
social justice Or racial justice That we
[SPEAKER_05]: would want to see From a truly legalized
cannabis community And so yeah the
[SPEAKER_05]: struggles That we face are substantial And
they're based largely on that fact So it
[SPEAKER_05]: took a while For direct sales of alcohol
You know that was the thing too And it
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't happen immediately And the cannabis
industry Has many different voices in it
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are representing Many different
constituencies You know we have The small
[SPEAKER_05]: operators The legacy operators Who are
trying to make the transition Into the new
[SPEAKER_05]: market You have that includes in both You
know the rural and urban areas Of the
[SPEAKER_05]: state All of whom were negatively impacted
By the war on drugs And continue to be to
[SPEAKER_05]: this day But you also have The kind of new
industry The outside capital The more
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional business interests That are
trying to capitalize On a perceived green
[SPEAKER_05]: rush And what that has done You know with
the oversupply And the fact that the one
[SPEAKER_05]: acre cap That was built into Prop 64 Was
never enforced Or made reality You know
[SPEAKER_05]: what we're seeing that right now With the
crash in the market And unfortunately it
[SPEAKER_05]: hasn't led to Lower prices for consumers
either And it hasn't led to A reduction in
[SPEAKER_05]: the illicit market And so you know it's
important To take a really 50,000 foot
[SPEAKER_05]: view Of this system And see how challenged
it is And the different constituencies
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly have different opinions On how
things should go And so it's really about
[SPEAKER_05]: working With legislators and regulators
And trying to push the needle In the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction For our communities And how
successful do you think Your efforts are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be With getting rid of those two
taxes The excise and the cultivators tax
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I think that there has definitely
been A appetite expressed By the
[SPEAKER_05]: governor's office For tax reform in
cannabis You know it's a really good
[SPEAKER_05]: Really challenging time Historically when
it comes to tax reform In cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: California Specifically around the
cultivation tax The challenge has been
[SPEAKER_05]: that That money is earmarked Towards
certain uses And so the groups that align
[SPEAKER_05]: With those uses You know labor For example
Are very It's very important to them To
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that Revenues that they have
come to count on Are not decreased So
[SPEAKER_05]: that's you know In the governor's
messaging You know we understand that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's A desire to address this But
they're looking at Also having to maintain
[SPEAKER_05]: Revenue neutrality Which is you know
Somewhat of a challenge Now we're hopeful
[SPEAKER_05]: that due to the Budget surplus The year on
year budget surplus And the fact that
[SPEAKER_05]: there is You know all of these resources
available That in order to save This
[SPEAKER_05]: community That is so endangered right now
It's the hardest And the backbone of
[SPEAKER_05]: California's Cannabis industry Drastic
actions need to be taken So you know we
[SPEAKER_05]: understand that There are important goals
And that it's important to weigh them With
[SPEAKER_05]: the realities on the ground And make sure
that we don't Lose this industry Before
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too late to save it Well It seems to
be in danger I notice that Media is
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting the cannabis industry Is on the
verge of collapse Due to over taxation And
[SPEAKER_00]: where do you think we go from here To
solve this problem Michael Well I think
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a combination of things You know it
is the state level And there will be
[SPEAKER_05]: legislation That's coming out For this
year That is going to address Many of
[SPEAKER_05]: these topics You know The legislators and
the regulators Are very aware of the
[SPEAKER_05]: challenges We have been very vocal About
our pain points At one point the state Was
[SPEAKER_05]: very clear about asking for those And so
we've been providing them Obviously there
[SPEAKER_05]: was a rally In Sacramento last week
There's a continued effort To engage with
[SPEAKER_05]: the DCC And CDFW And you know related
agencies And with our legislators And so
[SPEAKER_05]: we're very grateful To Origins Council
Which as I mentioned before Is a trade
[SPEAKER_05]: association made up Of six different trade
associations And those are from Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevada County Big Sur, Trinity,
Sonoma, and Mendocino And together we
[SPEAKER_05]: actually Create the largest cannabis
advocacy Organization in the state And so
[SPEAKER_05]: Origins Council Is working diligently On
these key points Because they really
[SPEAKER_05]: affect Hundreds and hundreds And honestly
thousands of stakeholders That are in the
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed market right now That are you
know Really need the support of the state
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to make it through this
transition Yeah Well isn't the Origins
[SPEAKER_00]: Council They also were working on an
Appalachians program right Sure so you
[SPEAKER_05]: know Yeah Janine Coleman Who's the
executive director Of the Origins Council
[SPEAKER_05]: She is a co-founder Of the Mendocino
Appalachians project And was integral In
[SPEAKER_05]: the working groups With CDFW And the
California Growers Association Discussing
[SPEAKER_05]: Appalachians And so yeah Origins Council
has been And the leadership therein Have
[SPEAKER_05]: been strong voices In advocating for this
program And we're excited to see Certain
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory Updates being considered You
know the goal is not to rush To market
[SPEAKER_05]: with this program The goal is to bring it
in With all of the appropriate safeguards
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure it's really viewed
Internationally and nationally As a real
[SPEAKER_05]: thorough program Based on internationally
accepted standards That will give it some
[SPEAKER_05]: teeth You know and really be able to put
Increased value behind the products Of our
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that we already know Were so
valuable Yeah that's cool So coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: to Mendocino What about the equity grant
program funds And who are they Designated
[SPEAKER_05]: for And how's that going Sure so the local
equity program Is funded by the state And
[SPEAKER_05]: the equity programs statewide Are designed
to address negative impacts From the war
[SPEAKER_05]: on drugs And so every county or
municipality Has the opportunity To
[SPEAKER_05]: provide to the state What's called a needs
assessment To determine what is the need
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the community How much impact Has the
war on drugs had To this community And
[SPEAKER_05]: what are their needs To be able to try to
alleviate Some of that damage And so
[SPEAKER_05]: through that process Which was spurred
greatly by MCA Our organization And Hannah
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelson Who is a MCA senior policy advisor
And also just A decades long advocate In
[SPEAKER_05]: the legal realm For civil rights and
criminal justice Yeah I read some of her
[SPEAKER_05]: writing Yeah she's an incredible,
incredible Advocate in our community Is
[SPEAKER_05]: truly lucky to have her And so We Had put
forward Proposals as a community Through
[SPEAKER_05]: MCA As to how the equity program Should be
administered And ultimately the county
[SPEAKER_05]: went with Some different route And to this
point There have been several edits Made
[SPEAKER_05]: to the program But unfortunately The funds
that are earmarked To be distributed Among
[SPEAKER_05]: our community Have yet to be distributed
So there have been There are several
[SPEAKER_05]: rounds of funding Our county was granted
$2.2 million In the initial funding round
[SPEAKER_05]: And to this point Not only have none of
those funds Actually been distributed But
[SPEAKER_05]: it's possible that by The end of February
The state has the ability To pull those
[SPEAKER_05]: funds back If they have not actually been
Provided to equity operators And so we
[SPEAKER_05]: have been Advocating for the removal of
barriers To get those funds distributed
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know Certainly right now The goal
of the equity program Is not being met
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the funds that are They're not the
county's funds They're the state funds
[SPEAKER_05]: That are earmarked For these individuals
And the program to disperse them As set up
[SPEAKER_05]: by the county Has proven to be Inadequate
Unable to meet the task At hand And so
[SPEAKER_05]: While there are people Who have been
involved Since February of last year In
[SPEAKER_05]: this application process Who still have
not seen a nickel And are still being
[SPEAKER_00]: asked To resubmit documents Yeah and this
is the Mendocino Cannabis program
[SPEAKER_05]: Administrators It's a combination So the
Mendocino County hired an outside group
[SPEAKER_05]: Called Elevate Impact And they're the
group That's the external administrator
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they receive payment For their
services Whether or not our grant funds
[SPEAKER_05]: Are distributed To my understanding And
about 10% of the grant funds Is allowed to
[SPEAKER_05]: be provided To the administration of it So
it's a combination Of that outside entity
[SPEAKER_05]: Working with the Mendocino Cannabis
program But then beyond that There's also
[SPEAKER_05]: the county council And the different
departments Within the county Risk
[SPEAKER_05]: assessment All these different things That
are you know Kind of Responsible to create
[SPEAKER_05]: This chain To enable the release of funds
And unfortunately It came to our attention
[SPEAKER_05]: That that process To develop those
agreements Even was not begun Until it was
[SPEAKER_05]: time To start giving them out To
applicants And so we're behind the eight
[SPEAKER_05]: ball 100% And really need swift action To
make sure That these funds are not lost
[SPEAKER_05]: And that future funds that come in Are
able to be distributed In an efficient and
[SPEAKER_05]: effective way So they can meet the goals
of the program So did I hear this
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outside entity That came in To
administer the program Gets like 250 grand
[SPEAKER_00]: To administer to the program Whether they
even give out Any money or not That's the
[SPEAKER_05]: agreement That they have is that They are
able to receive Up to 10% of the grant
[SPEAKER_05]: funds To administer the program They have
several grant administrators Underwriters
[SPEAKER_05]: working on the program Emailing with the
applicants But there has been no direct
[SPEAKER_00]: grant funds released And what's the name
of that entity?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is their Elevate Impact In Mendocino
County The website is Elevate Impact Mendo
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also apparently operate equity
programs In other jurisdictions I'm not
[SPEAKER_05]: 100% familiar What their track records are
there They're all very nice people But we
[SPEAKER_05]: have yet to see Any money actually Hit the
hands of the applicants And it's certainly
[SPEAKER_05]: not all on them It's a function of The
county's program being understaffed
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately unprepared To address this
As it was coming in With all of the other
[SPEAKER_05]: things That are happening And so there
really is a global issues There are global
[SPEAKER_05]: issues That really need to be addressed
And this is just a symptom of those
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting I hope this all works itself
out I know that any recreational user As
[SPEAKER_00]: well as a medical cannabis user Is
experiencing prices that are unsustainable
[SPEAKER_05]: For them as consumers even Absolutely,
yeah People have less and less resources
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we want to see The small businesses
Survive in California Especially let's
[SPEAKER_05]: remember Small cannabis businesses Do not
have access To federal relief funds So any
[SPEAKER_05]: funding that's come in As part of pandemic
relief Has not gone to cannabis farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's also remember They can't write it
Taxes off Yeah, 280E at the federal level
