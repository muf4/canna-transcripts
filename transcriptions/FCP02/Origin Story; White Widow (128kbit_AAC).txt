[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna segue into our recurring
strain history, but I'm gonna do a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of notes first about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the notes is gonna be is that,
as I said before, the whole point of
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about this strain history isn't to
come out with some definitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right, you're wrong, anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically to educate people on what
we know and, okay, which just happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want it to be an ongoing conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are listening to this,
and they end up hearing something that
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel is incorrect, or they have
nuance that they would like to add,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they have tidbits that they might want
to add, or they want to correct things,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not like us being, we welcome that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We welcome the conversation, we welcome
the people adding pieces to the tapestry,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the stuff that we talked about
on a previous show, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring up Gabby again, he wanted to
clarify and he wanted to chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been meaning on having to have him
on to talk about certain things anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that part of the ongoing
conversation will happen while he'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: his chance to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that happened that was
really cool is last week when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing, or we were discussing,
what we knew about Jim Ortega and the
[SPEAKER_00]: maple leaf, I'd mentioned that while Jim
Ortega was still alive, he was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: private and he has chosen to rarely,
or for the most part never, but maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little rarely, speak publicly in depth
about some of the history of that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does appear that he had made
friends in the era he came back as dogless
[SPEAKER_04]: with a handful of people that we share as
mutual friends and acquaintances of our
[SPEAKER_04]: own, and one of them did reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool is that everybody probably knows
who Bodhi is when it relates to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Bodhi and us are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he reached out to me because he
listened to the show and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey man, he's done some work with the Kush
4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's actually communicated with Jim
Ortega about details relating to the Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is lovely in a couple of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's because it comes from one of the
really cool breeders in our community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what, and I don't mean to
just like always black rain cloud shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: but more than that, very, very few people
besides Bodhi are looked at in such a way
[SPEAKER_04]: where basically everyone thinks you have
nothing to gain by misleading anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: that's antithetical to your personality
and who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have something to say or
something to add, that at the very least
[SPEAKER_04]: you're telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're telling your truth, what you were
told.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, we told our truth
or what we knew about the maple and about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kush 4 and the things that Jim Ortega
gave to Neville in a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi reached out with some correspondence
from Jim that enlightened a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about one of the lines we were talking
about, which was the Kush 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get into this week's chat
about strain history, I wanted to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: last week's and say that Jim Ortega had
written Bodhi and he told him that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush 4 seeds, they got in the early 1980s,
I believe it was 1982, okay, in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have all the notes in front of me,
so I don't know which college it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of not relevant,
but in New Mexico in 1982, there was some
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan exchange students that came out to
study at this particular college and
[SPEAKER_00]: through knowing him or his friends or some
mutual circles or what have you,
[SPEAKER_00]: they got a hold of seeds from Afghanistan
from these Afghan students out of which
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kush 4 came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Jim Ortega said is that obviously
1982 was pretty early in the game for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of Indicas throughout America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that those Indica lines that they
grew for a lot of consumers on both the
[SPEAKER_00]: East and West Coast were very unique and
very different than what they were used to
[SPEAKER_00]: getting and they worked with it a whole
bunch, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I spoke last week about the Kush
4, I mentioned that we barely know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, it came to them from exchange
students from Afghanistan in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980s in New Mexico and it got passed
along to Jim Ortega and friends down there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they ended up growing it and it ended
up getting blended into the USA market
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something that's interesting about the
story, and that's a cool story,
[SPEAKER_04]: I love hearing about people from
unexpecting or unassuming places being
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how is it any more exciting than
that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Random New Mexico, Afghan exchange
students.
[SPEAKER_04]: But something that really kind of got with
me about this story is that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: further explain what made it to Neville.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume that the seeds were
reproduced, whatever the Kush 4 was and
[SPEAKER_04]: that became the seed stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the clone that went around,
because Jim didn't come back around until
[SPEAKER_04]: about 15 years ago, that would have,
and I'm only using knowledge that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: heard as a community, we know that Jim
went away.
[SPEAKER_04]: For whatever reason, that's a thing that
happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that seed stock that survived that
he popped and that clone that goes or
[SPEAKER_04]: reproduced seed stock over years from
someone else and it doesn't really put us
[SPEAKER_04]: any closer to certain concrete answers
because there is a clone now that's from a
[SPEAKER_04]: seed line from 1982.
[SPEAKER_04]: When was that clone popped?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that clone, in fact, a product of pure
genetics or is it something?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it really matters to an
extent, but it's a good example of we can
[SPEAKER_04]: know what we know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have more clarity added even from
the original source and still not be 100%
[SPEAKER_04]: spot on and closer to any definitive
answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's, isn't that kind of
part of what makes cannabis magic?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all kind of like, I mean,
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's neat about it is that our little
chat on YouTube led to more information
[SPEAKER_00]: getting shared that was at one point
private.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it doesn't add a ton of
depth to the story, but it does add some
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, like now we know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know how they acquired the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know what year they acquired the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what state they were in at the
time, all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this could also lead to, you know,
you know, this could also lead to more
[SPEAKER_00]: information later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't want, I wouldn't love to
hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so every time we do this segment,
it is a convert, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, but sometimes it might be a
conversation starter where it brings
[SPEAKER_00]: people out of the woodwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might be like, Oh,
you were wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to add to the tapestry of the
story and correct it or change it or add
[SPEAKER_00]: nuance to it on a future show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was born in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_04]: You think I saw the original Kush for tell
me fucking more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's that's, that's just the way it
goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know, and there's like
little nebulous things that you can think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it's one that I told you,
and if this generates some sort of someone
[SPEAKER_04]: coming to be like, you know, the fuck
you're talking about kid, by all means,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, getting Jim would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's a lot of old timers
who are, you know, very important to the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be public or choose to
be private.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might have private connections
and they might say things to friends or
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's a lot, there,
there was a lot of deck aids where keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: your head down and staying invisible was
the most critical component to staying
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we do like a fundraiser to see how
much money we have to foist over to get
[SPEAKER_04]: uncle Dave to come on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to us about some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've got at least one fucking
skunk, one vintage fucking kilo cost on
[SPEAKER_03]: this interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here for it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start this week's,
we're going to start this week's segment
[SPEAKER_00]: of Strain History.
[SPEAKER_00]: On something that most people have
obviously probably heard of or had some
[SPEAKER_00]: familiarity with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to tell you what we know and
we're going to tell you a bit about like
[SPEAKER_00]: what we think it affected and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this week it is White Widow or on a
larger level, the White family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the basic story is this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that White Widow was released as a seed
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1995 by Shanti under the greenhouse
seeds label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It quickly became one of the, one of the
big strains of the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really changed the game in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're someone like me from
California or Chicago or what have you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you got that, you got the story
that it was, you know, Shanti Baba made
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from Holland, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was dropped under greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the, that was the line that
sprung into a number of different,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the White family, if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indian, Brazilian, Indian was collected by
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brazilian was some fucking line called
like the Cahiba or some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I go to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that, and it turns out
that most of the guys in Amsterdam would
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you that there was this, there was
this gentleman named Ingmar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was cracking open a block of hash
and at least one, maybe several seeds fell
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should clarify who he is too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a big player in the early coffee
shop, owner of an early coffee shop and
[SPEAKER_04]: seed bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, as far as allegations go,
long before it was called White Widow,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was called Arnhem's Wonder,
you know, based on the little neighborhood
[SPEAKER_04]: outside of, you know, I guess inside,
I'm sorry, I don't know that, that city
[SPEAKER_04]: that well, but like general Amsterdam
Metro greater area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where it was being passed
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was apparently being passed around as a
clone since maybe as early as 1989,
[SPEAKER_04]: from what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, you know, if someone who's
actually Dutch wants to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, you don't know the fuck you're
talking by all means, but that's,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was his shop called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or his seed bank?
[SPEAKER_00]: That I forget, but apparently you could go
in there and you could buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I'm not gonna, anyway,
you that, that was the tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got basically this very pure,
very frosty Afghan that came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently he even sold clones of it
out of his coffee shop to certain people
[SPEAKER_00]: at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I heard.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, so there's these
different origin stories, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was around for neither of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't, I can't add, I can't add
verification to either one, but what's
[SPEAKER_00]: indisputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that in the mid nineties, Shanti
released a seed line that was called white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took the cannabis world by storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly after he released it,
it was white labeled by various other seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the other thing that we
should mention too, is that the first
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups and the, and the high time
stuff in the late eighties, a lot of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the awards and a lot of the
pictures and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty ugly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed look ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, um, it just didn't, it just
wasn't very, it just wasn't very good by
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the white family sort of hit the
market high times has shifted and it had a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole like cannabis cup special edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the center of these high times at that
time would be very glossy, very high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality professional photos of pages of
all the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90, 95, 96, 97, 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for people like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, like you would get high
times and you would look through this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and you would see which one's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would see these high quality
photos and you would see all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would drool and want to get,
um, and, and want to get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white family really changed the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spot after white widow came out,
there was a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we spoke about it before it went from
peacemaker to great white shark to shark
[SPEAKER_00]: shock, which was white widow by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was another strain called white
rhino, uh, which was, which was white
[SPEAKER_00]: widow by a different Afghan, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think that he revealed in that last
interview that is indeed Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm wrong, but didn't he reveal that
it is Afghan T and white widow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't recall, but there was,
I would say the great white shark,
[SPEAKER_00]: white widow and white rhino were sort of
like the three headed Hydra of the white
[SPEAKER_00]: strains through greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all won a bunch of awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for the time they were super
photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they ended up getting crossed to a
bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon from Syria seeds, uh, took the white
widow and crossed it to his AK 47 line and
[SPEAKER_00]: he called it, and he called it white
Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause obviously the AK 47 is a play on a
Russian, uh, uh, you know, a Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: assault rifle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became one of like the five or
six strains that Simon sold for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, you know, the, uh, the,
the, the white Russian, um, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that between 95 and the
early two thousands, the white family
[SPEAKER_00]: became one of the dominant strains in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I feel like if you got into weed
and from like, maybe like 96 to like 2000
[SPEAKER_04]: and like, you know, 1998, 1999 is when my
little juvenile shit head mind started
[SPEAKER_04]: being like, Ooh, look weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the shit that my mom and my sister
smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, uh, like I saw those pictures like
in the, you know, 99, 2000 high times of
[SPEAKER_04]: like white Russian, just like the two
page, like ads were serious had like,
[SPEAKER_04]: boom, boom, boom, bud shot lined up next
to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paradise had them too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all looked so fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I have never seen weed in
the fucking in the wooden box hiding in
[SPEAKER_04]: the fucking random drawer that fucking
looked like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, and part of it is that since high
times went from like these, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at like the, the 89 and 90
high times cannabis cup photos or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, they're pretty awful
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more cry babies world, but like
they're dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very attractive looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're small photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time the white family dropped,
like I said before, like the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: these high times would be multi-page,
big glossy, different kinds of paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: very well lit, much, much, much nicer nug
picks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those something, something I want to
grab before it gets away from me because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're so, so, so randomly questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just answer so accurately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, someone said Sharon white widow was
apparently popped from Sensi white label
[SPEAKER_04]: stock in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pop by, um, Lone star of Texas
resin company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, it was real fucking ugly,
but apparently real fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one of those, one of those dudes still
has it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a buddy of his, maybe it's
composer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's one of those dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's, there's people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like legendarily finicky and a pain
in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and then the question about Aloha.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was Jojo Rizzo who's unfortunately
not with us anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, neither is Lone star from Texas
resident company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but so there was a cut and he had that
and it was called like sweet thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like cherry and it came from a
club in the Netherlands called Aloha
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it wasn't really a seed bank,
but they sold seeds and they had a special
[SPEAKER_04]: white widow cut that was indeed a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: He went back years later because it was so
fucking good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he loved it so much and got more
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the F gens of the Aloha
widow from him came from as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, look, look, I'm actually fucking
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and you know, I mean, the hard part
is, is that if you talk, if you talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: people in, in Holland, there are any
number of people that will stand by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingmar story.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti Shanti has said that he developed
it and it's from him and that's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, so I'm, we're just telling you the two
competing tales of how it came to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that that second story
could come with like might be a lie,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it might come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could come with like a free side of the
Dutch mob with a gun to the side of your
[SPEAKER_04]: head as, as Ariane says, this is our shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we can say definitively, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it wasn't until Shanti released
his seed line in the mid nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it became world renowned and there
was seeds available to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just came into Holland to grab
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Ingmar story is true, it was
basically a local phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you could only get the clones if
you knew him or you, you knew his coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shop or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Shanti dropped it with
greenhouse, the next three or four years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 95, 96, 97, 98 ish,
whatever those years were dominated by
[SPEAKER_00]: various white widow hybrids or white widow
itself winning a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of cups, placing a bunch,
getting a bunch of fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become somewhat same with some of the
biggest stories in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti still sells a version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls it black widow because when he
released it under greenhouse, Ariane
[SPEAKER_00]: trademarked the white widow name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he owns the white widow name.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can still go to Mr. Nice and
get a version called black widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: From him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you believe selling a version too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen them run back to back by
the same grower at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ingmar's version is called master widow
and he's worked on it progressively.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually one of the few parents that
we know from anything we know about what
[SPEAKER_04]: Luke's done at paradise seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, if it's that coveted in that
program must something good must have come
[SPEAKER_04]: out of it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I haven't ever seen them compared
and I would have loved to see that
[SPEAKER_04]: Ingmar's first seed iteration,
first, the first greenhouse iteration that
[SPEAKER_04]: would be, that would really be telling,
you know, there's no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt that Shanti through
greenhouse popularized it and made it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed community, a household name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting is something that I
had heard and it was a story that went
[SPEAKER_04]: around that it might not be true,
but something I'd heard over the years was
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a former either Dutch living,
but German born hash smuggler,
[SPEAKER_04]: someone who was doing what like Hank,
you know, was doing early, like moving,
[SPEAKER_04]: moving fucking bricks, like getting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by the way, bulldog guy, some of those
guys, a variety of them super legit,
[SPEAKER_04]: they weren't just random fucking weed shop
owners like you see today.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were dudes that fucking smuggled
hash and fucking really tried to break
[SPEAKER_04]: down the laws where they were fucking from
or living.
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely those dudes still deserve
respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like basically what I was saying was
there's a story about one of the dudes
[SPEAKER_04]: like that who ended up being an editor of
a very early counterculture magazine over
[SPEAKER_04]: there, having brought back random fucking
seeds and even maybe some plants from
[SPEAKER_04]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those would have.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those would have entered the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, so much earlier than Shanti got
there because he wasn't from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, you know, he's like Ned and I was
from Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess where Shanti was from as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most most cannabis stories begin with
a certain amount of division and mystery
[SPEAKER_00]: because they come out of the shadows,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but what's indisputable is that
after Shanti released it under the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse label as White Widow,
it dominated for probably a good eight to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got crossed into all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those white frosty,
you know, potent Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a really there was some really
famous like cuts going around in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they took Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they smashed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was much tastier than White Widow
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was much more potent than the
Blueberry was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, like the White family got
crossed into all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you go any further, just because I
brought it up earlier, someone said motor
[SPEAKER_04]: breath is like white rhino, but less body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, motor breath's fucking,
you know, got that kind of fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: petrochem odor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember when we were talking about
the clarity of Afghan tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's and that's always been
interesting to me is that if indeed white
[SPEAKER_04]: rhino is Afghan tea White Widow,
that would be an example of one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: rare combinations where Afghan tea turns
real nasty, because it's interesting to
[SPEAKER_04]: think of that as like some skunk archetype
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, part of the greater scheme of
the nastiness of super skunk.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how people imagine it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whatever that dials into, whether
that's this or that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that same parent produces nothing but
sweet plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have the most broad, like squat
versions of Afghan haze, which should
[SPEAKER_04]: theoretically also be made with Afghan
tea, unless all of it's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all sweet plants, like syrupy
sweet, like the way that the drunkers
[SPEAKER_04]: described fucking Maple Leaf Indica seed
line when it came out like sweet or limey
[SPEAKER_04]: or fucking whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's interesting because White Widow
would be the kind of parent or have the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic capability to make Afghan tea
represent a skunk instead of skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: petrochemical I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard people say white rhino's
fucking horrible airplane blue odors came
[SPEAKER_04]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit doesn't come out of medicine,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like it's White Widow is an
interesting breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about it is unique enough that
it does drag out interesting things from
[SPEAKER_04]: other hybrids that otherwise don't exist
in those hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became one of the modern building
blocks of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it became super popular through
winning all these awards in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had some amazing pictures that drove a
lot of drooling because back then I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you as a young seed buyer,
it was very difficult to get a hold of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all regular seed lines at the
time because the feminized breeding thing
[SPEAKER_00]: had definitely not taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you bought them, you got males and
you could use pollen to cross on to other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became so popular that most of the
young other seed banks bid it,
[SPEAKER_00]: bought seeds of it, made their own
versions of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started offering all kinds of
hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started getting mixed into all kinds of
things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sort of became, I would say
probably from, I don't know, 1995 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s, it was one of the dominant
most popular strains in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably in a lot more things than
its name gets credit for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the combination of
greenhouses' popularity at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many awards it won, how many glossy
expos and people getting, like me being
[SPEAKER_00]: young, getting all excited, going over to
Holland and buying that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really made a major impact,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it was bred entirely by
Shanti, whether it was an accidental bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even bag seed hash, block find from
Omar, whether it's some hybrid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like Shanti took the clone and
crossed it to Brazilian City and worked it
[SPEAKER_00]: some before he, you know, he did something
to make it a seed line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not he created it from himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like what we want to do
is rather than being like, these people
[SPEAKER_00]: are right, these people are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are two slightly intertwined
stories that multiple people you talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in a hash block that literally,
I think that's literally like a seed fell
[SPEAKER_00]: out of, you know, and in Holland back
then, most Amsterdam was hash culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really weren't into, they really
weren't into flower that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was in the 80s, especially most
of those guys were very hashish based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I can't verify it or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you that there are
multiple old connected people in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: that believe that story completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a doubt in their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't, they don't even tell it
like it's a supposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell it like, it's just like a
statement of fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I always, I always think of
Homeboy's little expose on Shanti where he
[SPEAKER_04]: was like, I'm the fucking king of
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do you think you are?
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's, what was always screwy to me
about that is like, other than the
[SPEAKER_04]: obvious, like straw man and personal
attacks and shit, everything else seemed
[SPEAKER_04]: very reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was the dude that hired you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's, so just for people know
too, for modern day, he does know some
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the, if you take the Shanti
version, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously greenhouse owns all the those
names.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mr. Nice sells, I believe white rhino.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls it medicine man today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sells white widow as black widow and he
sells great white shark as shark shock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe Simon from Sirius still
sells white Russian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of his, I think it's one
of his, I think it's still like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Simon only has six or seven
strains he sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a new thing, but it's just made of
old things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean white Russian is one of those
half a dozen things that has been on his
[SPEAKER_00]: menu since the nineties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: His, you know, Oh boys, Cali mist fell
apart and like, I hate to break it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but no one really wants like strawberry or
keel or like white rush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they want the old shit and like,
here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you lost the moms and you don't
want to own up to it because it came from
[SPEAKER_04]: a result of really bad experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your personal business is your personal
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have something that like people
have an allegiance to something that can
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, keep your legend alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do absolutely everything in my
fucking power to give someone the truest
[SPEAKER_04]: version of what they wanted and what they
remembered, especially if I was playing
[SPEAKER_04]: with enough money that that wouldn't be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at some point it's about like,
it's strange to see people who have been
[SPEAKER_04]: around for a long time, trying to burn
their legacy to squeeze a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking extra bucks out of it at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can do whatever you want with
your life, fam.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I would, I would hate to see
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I hate to see Bernard selling like
random cheap CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you're a fucking person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I would say that my favorite
version of white widow was the peacemaker
[SPEAKER_00]: great white shark, shark shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was some, some of the most
potent weed I've smoked from, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: from over there was, uh, was, was that
it's incredibly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would say like the best
outcross I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moat, I mentioned it before was blue
widow, which combined somehow the turps of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blueberry line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really flavorful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was extremely frosty and potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it sort of took qualities that each
line had and merge them with qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: that each line didn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like white widow was kind of bland,
but it was very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry was kind of had, had some terpy
elements, but wasn't particularly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, there was a, when I was going to
those like harvest festivals and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that in the Canna Bible era,
um, blue widow was a pretty popular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some phenos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just absolutely lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great blue widow out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even, even for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, it was, it was, it was a
really, it was, I haven't seen it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was delicious and it was very
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of thought that like,
it was an improvement upon both lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The out, the, the outcross itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, if anybody's
listening, you know, uh, if anybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: any, any, um, any key points or anything
like that, or anyone has any like bits of
[SPEAKER_00]: information about anything that we talked
about on this little bit of strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history, by all means, reach out to me or
crybaby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, on a, on a future show
or something like that, before we do that
[SPEAKER_00]: week strain history, we might amend or add
to, or add some nuance to stuff we've said
[SPEAKER_00]: before, you know, and all that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to keep doing this,
um, you know, some of the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: histories, it's a little difficult because
some of them, it's like, we could talk for
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two minutes about what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hit a brick wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of started with the maple leaf and
the white, white lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of started it off on stuff that we
thought we could chat about for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: good 30 plus minutes, because there was a
lot of depth to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like versions of the story
and they had a big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason why I'm not shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I'm just, I was just telling
you, those two stories, those two stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out, like, and give us the info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just telling you, this is Ingmar's
version of the tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Shanti's version of the tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whoever believes what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's upon them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truth could be one of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth could be a blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard to say, you know,
why the two hour market thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've talked enough about widow
speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at the two hour mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep doing this same
channel, same timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, we're going to add various
things to it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you guys all like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's kind of like,
yeah, we're going to try to keep it to two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and we've gone over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to thank Peter again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank his homie who
stepped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Peter was unable to be the man behind
the scenes and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be here next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only closing thing I would say is
that thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love the conversation and it's an open
invitation to reach out with stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: tales, bits of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all just trying to sort of like
orally document our shady history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I, what I posted earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who are watching on Instagram,
I can't put their comments up on screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to copy paste them from
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I'd add someone's two cents
on that story from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example of someone just asked,
we're going to, yeah, we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: an email, but we are slacking on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just what I was going to do is give you
guys both access to, I think was it this
[SPEAKER_01]: one questions that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can create like a group log in and
just log in and that would be lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to us on that,
that he just posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to me on IG under not so
dog or crybaby organics on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
