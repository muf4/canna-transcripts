[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, October 30th, another Field Notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from our Afghan selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one more variety and this is
called Baha Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baha Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting about this
particular Afghan is all the other Afghans
[SPEAKER_00]: we grew were the squatty, really dense,
thick, extremely indica-like structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this Barak, and we had another one we
already harvested, have more what you
[SPEAKER_00]: could be considered more of a sativa-type
bud structure where they're just a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: thin spear and then the leaves are also
thin instead of the big, wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: indica-type leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this seems to have more of a sativa
influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also what's really unique about
these flowers is they're just very open
[SPEAKER_00]: and airy and separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you can come in on this
and where you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost like foxtails of foxtails
of foxtails all on this big, giant spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and who knows, maybe this would be a
good like hash washing trait just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so open and all the crystals there
would be super accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so this is just very unique
for an Afghan to have this structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nose is nothing, it's pleasant,
but it's not mind-blowing and loud or it
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of smells clean and fresh,
but not super loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows, once it cures out,
the flavor could be amazing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects could be absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just while it's growing, it's not a crazy,
crazy loud smelling plant, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's about, it's hard to tell
when these are ready, but, and I don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: a speck of mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another very unique, cool plant that
we'd never know about unless we tried
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you to everyone in
Afghanistan, because these genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just an honor to be able to grow
these plants here in Santa Cruz and just
[SPEAKER_00]: so stoked that there's amazing cannabis
breeders and cultivators all over this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully someday we'll all unite in
some way, but right now we connect through
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, oh, it's October 30th,
if I didn't say that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Barak.
