[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing another field notes on this one,
Kandahar, another Afghan land race
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm by myself, so I'm doing a selfie style
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, it's not quite as flexible with the
video, but we've got three Kandahar plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that want to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very, very, very different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three are distinctly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing when these plants come
from a region, it's not necessarily that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all going to be completely
uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're definitely seeing with the
Kandahar three completely unique
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flip this around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of I've seen a number of
Afghans that have this just bushy globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, we didn't top this plant
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of a cousin it just big
brown blob of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are actually really nice chunky
colas in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might even consider taking some of these
today, but probably the top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then over here, we've got our third or
second Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see completely different
structure, totally different structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so obviously this is not a
uniform from the region of Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, and this one's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do a smell check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very strong, perfumey, sort of that
same bug spray mothball situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, really intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't think of a better thing than
mothballs and bug spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little cedar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have another Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, totally different structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hot, tall, really shot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's tall and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is actually not this probably
has at least two weeks to go until these
[SPEAKER_00]: buds finish out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just go back to this other one,
because we, by the way, we're definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to harvest some of these tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, by the way,
we don't pull the yellow leaves off and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry, if that's offensive to anyone,
we just kind of let the plant do its
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they finish flower, they start
dropping leaves sort of like just leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: of a tree in autumn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, but that's what these buds look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yet again, another very cool
Afghan variety, Kandahar, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start harvesting right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Thanks for watching.
