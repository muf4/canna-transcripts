[SPEAKER_00]: Things are looking good here under the
Spider Farmer SE5000 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: 480 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fits the footprint of my 4x4 perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much, not too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the sweet spot where a lot of
the home cultivation is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, the Nakatomi plazas are
growing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sohum Living Soil is doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did one top dressing a couple weeks ago
of the Kiss Organics Nutrient Pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I've been giving these
just straight up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in three gallon pots,
which is smaller than the size they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to push it because I want to find
where that line is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great success with the soil,
so I'm not really that surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things are looking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, on day 36, I'm a day late on
the week update, but day 36 on a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much a 60, well, 55 to 65 day strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go in and take a closer look at
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, kind of a general aerial shot
as we slide in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I didn't do any like topping or
anything on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, they're going to be
growing, you know, nice tall cola there,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice tall cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tall cola, cola, cola, cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, another thing that I do
appreciate about these is they are putting
[SPEAKER_00]: off, you know, like the side buds,
little colas, you know, little colas,
[SPEAKER_00]: boom, boom in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the other one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually good size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I didn't do anything to
control the apical dominance on these,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let them grow as they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is kind of how they're looking
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is day 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, you know, starting to put on
some color there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that looks pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I didn't defoliate after I said
I was going to defoliate a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 44 on the Nakatomi Plaza grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting close to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them are showing signs are
going to be done really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just call it two that look like they
may go a week longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go in and take a look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had three of the same height and
three with the same bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, just trying to group them into
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I did not defoliate, but the one
to on the right side of the tent was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually same height, same shape,
same everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I defoliated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll kind of see if, you know,
all of a sudden the defoliated one has
[SPEAKER_00]: much larger, smaller buds versus the one
with the least still on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just kind of a fun little
experiment that I'm doing on this grow
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I will say is this one still
has a lot more white pistils, stigmas,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, a lot more white stigmas on it
compared to this one that I defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that related or was it just maybe
because I bumped some of them and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that caused them to mature
early?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are these two Nakatomi plazas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this one in the center,
which was one of the two taller ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it actually shares the same bud
structure as the other two shorter ones I
[SPEAKER_00]: just showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one I also defoliated,
just wanted to create a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know, it's like I shaved the
legs on it, but the side branches are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud set is pretty tight on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the other Nakatomi plaza in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that Nakatomi plaza in back
that, you know what, I mean, it really
[SPEAKER_00]: reminds me of the Westport grape juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this thing looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got decent, you know, buds on the
sides, just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't see because the camera so
freaking or the light so bright on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna move it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this one in the back,
which is just fucking doinking up,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is just putting on powerful
freaking colas on every branch tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a little bit of
nutrient issues with the lease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know what, it seems to be doing
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big old donkey cola here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do I need to like zoom out to get
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's the Nakatomi plaza in the
back growing some nice fatty buds wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: you look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one, whoo, the smell is pretty
damn pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is day 51 of flower on the Nakatomi
plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nakatomi plaza water only and a 480
watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're looking at on day 51.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we really start looking at this
plant, I just want to go down and show you
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, there is a little bit of
yellow on the lower lease, the senescence
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you're, you know, nine,
10 days away from harvest, you would kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in this soil in the three gallon
containers, you will get some senescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that back there on the
other plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the lower losing its color,
sending it upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so some natural senescence even
in this organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the tops are doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're checking out the plant
in the left front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting on some, you know, decent buds all
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is probably going to go the
longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one might go 63 days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the most white pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, and I actually left on a lot of
the foliage on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrary to the one in the upper right
corner because again, these two have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same morphology, same bud structure,
all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to see how hard I go on the
thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it affect those buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the one in the front left
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that plant in the upper right
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one where you can see I defoliated a
lot of the big lease off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fresh Kool-Aid man in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at the one with the buds
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, as you can see, I did the
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just kind of arm sticking
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, all of the arms,
they've got really good dense bud coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a lot of waste of space,
not a lot of waste and lumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one in the upper front right
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got the one in the very center
of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, too, I defoliated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of got the arm sticking
off full of buds, you know, nicely dense
[SPEAKER_00]: bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the Nakatomi Plaza is going to put
out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the one in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stoked with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a look at the one in the back left
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that had a whole bunch of
purple with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, chunking up nice and
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of beautiful purple colors on this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this was the one that reminds me of
the Westport grape juice the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by the way the bud is, the way it
grew, and the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this is the one in the back
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the back right corner is what
we're looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one has put on some pretty nice
buds, you know, pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves look like there's a little bit
of nutrient burns or damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is just water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sohum Living Soil with that one top
amendment of Kisswood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these things are really stacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, this thing is probably going to
put on the most weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got good tricum coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just pretty dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's putting on the thick cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one in the back right
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 51 of flower, the Nakatomi Plaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably, well, yeah, I'll make
another video before I harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it will be the harvest video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been getting a lot of requests
about harvesting, drying, and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to do that with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for following along with this
Grow Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there should be one more entry on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am listening and I will do something
on drying and curing with this batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
