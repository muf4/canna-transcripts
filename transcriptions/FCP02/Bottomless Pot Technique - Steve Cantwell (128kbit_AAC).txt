[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, this is Steve Cantwell,
GLP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I want to share a bottomless pot
technique with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our 27th cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This planted earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my growers save me one bed just to
demonstrate this for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so this is one of our beds after
a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're seeing here is two cycles
worth of pots on top of the soil and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: explain the reason behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pot here with less Dichondra,
with less cover crop in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the cycle, the last cycle
that was just harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me skip one and we go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we create a grid of 18
and or 12 plants per cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is a 12 grid plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all one grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is at my 18 plant grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12.
That's all one grid.
And then this is at my 18 plant grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is I use this grid to rotate
my crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically my Indica dominant strains
for the most part will take 18 plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: bed to fill the canopy in the amount of
time I have to fill the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the 12 grid plants are like more
sativa, if you will, in structure and they
[SPEAKER_00]: only take 12 plants to fill the canopy in
the space on the time I have allocated for
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by putting the 18 versus 12 on every
other cycle, I'm forcing myself to rotate
[SPEAKER_00]: my strains, to rotate my crop,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not growing the same cannabis
variety in the same bed over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again and potentially stripping the soil
of what it is that that plant actually
[SPEAKER_00]: likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do today is we're
going to remove the pot from two cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and replace it with a fresh plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the pot that was just
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give it one cycle to break
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the pot from one cycle
ago that's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we do this is because if I were
to try to remove this pot with fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, it's still anchored to the bed and
it's going to create a big mess,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big disturbance, and it's going to be a
lot more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas this pot that had a cycle to break
down, its roots are broken down,
[SPEAKER_00]: it lifts right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: With minimal mess, minimal disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple things to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to try this out with by
cutting the bottoms of your old pots out,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely do it before you plant into
those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't grow in pots with bottoms and then
cut it out because you're going to shock
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to only get the benefit
of not having to dig holes versus the less
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to get the full benefit,
both less reduced labor and reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant shock, then cut the bottoms of
your pots out before planting into them,
[SPEAKER_00]: before planting your clones or your seed
into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you go with grass roots,
like these are grass roots pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go with grass root pots over a
plastic pot, the plastic pots will hold
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture a little bit longer on top of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just water them every other day
with a grass root pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to water them almost
every day the first five to seven days
[SPEAKER_00]: until their roots start to transfer into
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay guys, so check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm going to do is pull up on this
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could already feel it just lightly
ripping off the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my hand, put my hand underneath it
[SPEAKER_00]: and lift up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the old roots, everything's there
intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just take this, I'm going to throw
it in a wheelbarrow and that way I can
[SPEAKER_00]: hard it off and put it into a tote and
then reuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to take the fresh pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you want to do is not water
these pots the day of planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my growers pranked me knowing I
was going to do this video and they
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily watered these pots before leaving
them for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it heavier, a little bit
more challenging, but this is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wiggle it into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have time, kind of push the mulch
up against it, but that's basically as
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remove one and you replace it with
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about as easy as it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not digging a hole and having
to move a bunch of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just lifting one pot and putting back
another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the pot that we just removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to kind of talk about
was the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done this yet, but the
potential to remove it and place it
[SPEAKER_00]: directly on a saucer and plant directly
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, without having to dump and mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this is the best idea for,
you know, 20 cycles, but it's something if
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's running smoothly,
you might be able to get away with for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, two, three, maybe four cycles
before having to actually dump this out
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we amend your veg mix if it calls
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not sure if this is the
direction that this tech is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to show you guys how to
fill these bottomless pots in case you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't figured it out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you then take a saucer, take an empty
pot, place it on top of the saucer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing this with one hand, obviously,
because I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're just going to fill the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to then shake your
pot, make sure everything settles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave a little bit of room for water to
catch water and top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically go to the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question I get asked a lot is how
do we take care of the bottomless pots
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to placing them on the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, we're just sitting
on a rack, on a saucer, on just another
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're here for about two to three weeks
just to get some size, get some root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them about every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we call it rain, we just rain on
them from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, treat it like you
would any other pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to close out this video by
reiterating some things that I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, keep in mind again that this
technique was designed for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: scale to reduce labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way, we discovered some benefits
as far as less plant shock that anyone can
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from at any scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind that that's the main
focus of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're having one lighter at home
and you like digging holes, more power to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind our soil is well maintained,
well aerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to grow healthy plants
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mainly for us in our situation to
reduce the amount of labor going in and
[SPEAKER_00]: out of each room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, if you go with the grass
roots fabric bottomless pots versus a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: pot with a cut out bottom, keep in mind
with the grass root pots, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to water a little more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say at first, every day, every other
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once the roots sow themselves
into the beds, as long as the beds are
[SPEAKER_00]: moist and wet, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the first five, seven,
maybe seven to 10 days, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make sure every day, every other
day, you kiss the top of the pots with
[SPEAKER_00]: some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just until they sow into the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing, I can't say for sure yet,
but it seems that topping the plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: after placing them seems to help the roots
transfer a little bit faster into the beds
[SPEAKER_00]: and we get faster growth rates by doing
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I'm still in the testing
phases of, but it's something that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys like what I shared with you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys use it, like it, don't like
it, whatever, hit me up to be posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely curious to hear what you
guys think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you guys success.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
