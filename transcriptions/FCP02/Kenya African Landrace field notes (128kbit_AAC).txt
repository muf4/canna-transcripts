[SPEAKER_00]: Hey a few more African sativa field notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting to see that these
Africans are finally going off and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: close to finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this I'd have to say as a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I haven't sampled any of these the
final like effects of the dried flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: because we haven't harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is from Kenya and we grew a bunch
of Kenyan lambray seeds this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact we've got one two three four five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have five female Kenyans and they
all are fairly uniform in this just really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice sort of globular structure just
covered in spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually a very efficient design
for yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could actually be sort of a
productiony type plant.
Weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of I know what hit was almost a
little vulgar kind of a almost body odor
[SPEAKER_00]: smell but you know like a pheromone musky
primal sort of body odor funk that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also herbs savory herbs with some body
odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds disgusting but it's
actually kind of intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another Kenyan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that kind of has that same little
bit of funk going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of a body odor thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they all have to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kind of somewhat uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are probably the most uniform
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All five of these phenos really are very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again maybe we can come in close so you
can see this is the most done one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you this one's ready to be
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be even harvested right now but
may let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a speck of mold on any of
these as these are African sativas which
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to not have mold issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah are you able to get crystal on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No I'm getting ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay maybe this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to hang out and see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway that is the Kenyan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful beautiful beautiful
gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again these are field notes for our own
record but we're sharing them with you so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can if you're excited or interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sharing it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway Kenya very cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
