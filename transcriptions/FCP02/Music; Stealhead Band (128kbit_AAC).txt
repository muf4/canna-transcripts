[SPEAKER_03]: My time comes any day.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one will hit that window.
[SPEAKER_03]: With someone who felt this way,
and I'm hitting over the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Afternoon, the streets turn gray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I watch the cars below.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I worry about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I don't worry about them,
no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, it's time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: California, profit on the burning show.
[SPEAKER_03]: California, knock, knockin' on the golden
door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an angel standing in a shaft of
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rising up to paradise.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm on the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: My time comes any day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't worry about me, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all hard.

light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rising up to paradise.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm on the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you all in your sleep?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would not believe me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The voices come to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tell me you're receiving.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're standing on the beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sea will part with burning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will follow me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your rear will rise to glory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock, knock, knockin' on the golden door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an angel standing in a shaft of
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: My word fills the sky with flame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mighty glory will be my name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're gonna light my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_04]: You don't worry about me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't worry about me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't worry about me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't worry about me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I was walking down Governor's Square.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a hilt to the winner, but a nip to the
air.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the other direction, he was calling
my eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being in a mood, but I might as well try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well try.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rings on her fingers and bells on her
shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it without asking she was into the
blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarlet begonias tucked into her clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew right away she was enough like
other girls.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the heat of the evening when the
dealing got rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was too hot to open and too cold of
love.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I picked up my lashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was closing the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those flashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'd been there before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd been there before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't open right, but I've never been
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of truth out the way, doesn't it say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in a while, you can get through the
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the strangest of places, if you look at
it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There ain't nothing wrong with the way
that she moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scarlet begonias are in touch with the
blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with the love.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that's in her eyes has learned the
hard way to let her pass by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let her pass by.
Let her pass by.
Let her pass by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wind in the willow playing T for two.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sky was yellow and the sun was blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strangers stopping strangers just to shake
their hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's playing in the heart of two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart of gold man.
Heart of gold man.
Heart of gold man.
Heart of gold man.
Heart of gold man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart of gold man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart of gold man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart of gold man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart of gold man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long distance runner.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you standing there for?
[SPEAKER_03]: You get up, get up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out of the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're playing cold music on the foreign
floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're drowning your laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're dead to the core.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a dragon with matches.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's loose on the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire on the town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Takes a whole pail of water just to cool
him down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost ablaze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still you don't feel the heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes all you got just to stay on the
beat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You say it's a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all gotta eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're here alone and there's no one
to compete.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mercy's a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more than just laughter when your
dreams come true.
Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long distance runner.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you would foot out the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're caught in slow motion in a fall to
the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flame from your stage is spread to the
floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gave all you had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why won't I get more?
[SPEAKER_03]: The more that you give.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more it will take.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the thin line beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really care, babe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
Fire.
Fire on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire.
Fire.
Yeah.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
[SPEAKER_03]: The morning comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: She follows the path to the river shore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gladly sung.
[SPEAKER_03]: The song is the last.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the morning's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sparkling the reeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Silver leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass to the sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comes from a town where they call her the
work of his daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Found is the bank where she kneels down to
gather her water.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the stake.
[SPEAKER_03]: The river his daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild and free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Round and round.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cut of the plow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's drowned.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bushels of corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: The barley meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Broken ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open and back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to live again.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ground is as broad as the back of the
land he has sown.
[SPEAKER_03]: He dances the circular track of the plow
every now and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the works of his days measures more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The planting and growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild and free.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the name is on the earth that takes it
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I'll speak will stand inside the
rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And listen to the thunder shout,
I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: No it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make what we make.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the world began.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The love of the women.
[SPEAKER_03]: The work of men.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seasons round.
[SPEAKER_03]: Creatures great and small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laughing down.
[SPEAKER_03]: To rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.

[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you are the song of the morning
rain.
Our land is deep in this homeland.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
Rise and fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comes a redeemer and he slowly too fades
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follows a wagon behind him and slot him
with clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds that were silent are burst into
bloom and decay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Night comes so quiet and it's soft on the
heels of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wake up to find out that you are the eyes
of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heart has its features, its homeland's
thoughts of its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now discover that you are the song that
the morning brings.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heart has its seasons, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give it up for Misha on bass.
Let's give it up for him.
Let's give it up for him.
Let's give it up for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we live no particular way but
our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we visit your countries and live
in your home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we ride on your horses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we walk alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the songs that we hear are the
songs of our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to find out that you are the eyes
of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heart has its features, its homeland's
thoughts of its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now discover that you are the song that
the morning brings.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heart has its seasons, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
Now discover that you are the song that
the morning brings.

The heart has its features, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
Now discover that you are the song that
the morning brings.
The heart has its features, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heart has its features, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heart has its features, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
The heart has its features, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now discover that you are the song that
the morning brings.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heart has its features, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heart has its features, its evenings,
its songs of its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the fire lights aglow, the stream's
shadows from the flames will grow to
[SPEAKER_03]: things we've never seen will seem
familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the storytellers speak, a door
within the fire creaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It suddenly flies open, and a girl is
standing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her eyes of light with flowing hair,
all that fancy paint has found.
[SPEAKER_03]: She takes her fan and she throws it in the
lion's den.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wish of you to gain me help will risk
uncertain pains of hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not forgive if you will not take
the chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sailor makes at least a try,
the soldier being mine to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The strategy was his train of disaster.
I will not forgive if you will not take
the chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sailor calling out again, the lady
fairly left at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it stands today, you decide if
he was wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Storytelling makes no choice, soon you
will not hear his voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: His job is to shed light and not to
master.
I will not forgive if you will not take
the chance
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon the end is never told, we pay the
seller off and go in hopes he will know
[SPEAKER_03]: that he cannot be bought or stolen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inspiration, move me bright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light the song with sense and color,
hold away despair.
[SPEAKER_03]: More than this I will not ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fist with mystery, dark and last.
[SPEAKER_03]: Statements just seem vain at last.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some ride, some climb, some climb,
it's a terrible thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Counting stars by candlelight,
all I didn't say was that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spiral light of enus, rising first to
shining best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wolf from the northwest corner of a brand
new crescent moon.
[SPEAKER_03]: While crickets in cicadas sing a rare but
different tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible mistakes, in the shadow of the
moon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible mistakes, and I know we'll be
there soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me, I can't figure out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me if it's the end or beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me, the train's pulling its brakes
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me, and the whistle is screaming,
tell me.
Tell me if it's the end or beginning.
Tell me if it's the end or beginning.
Tell me if it's the end or beginning.
Tell me if it's the end or beginning.
Tell me if it's the end or beginning.
Tell me if it's the end or beginning.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
[SPEAKER_03]: While you were gone, these spaces filled
with darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obvious was hidden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing to believe in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The compass always points to terror.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in Terrapin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slowing the wings of fortune to feed like
rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in Terrapin, for good or ill again.
