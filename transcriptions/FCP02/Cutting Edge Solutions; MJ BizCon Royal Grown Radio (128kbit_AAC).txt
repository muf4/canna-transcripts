[SPEAKER_02]: So come on in we're gonna welcome Sean and
Kevin from Cutting Edge Solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys want to kind of take the
ends and you guys got hand mics that are
[SPEAKER_01]: yours to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here grab a mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much what we decided.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like good for video purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and we're just kind of shooting the
breeze about what's going on and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: telling the story of MJBizCon that it's
been going on for 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep just the 10th year anniversary here we
are doing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first MJBiz too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's surprising.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always doing other events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we were just talking about that in a
little live segment that we just did where
[SPEAKER_01]: you know even when this thing has gotten
as big as it was in 2019 the last time
[SPEAKER_01]: they did it there's still a ton of people
in this industry that are big players that
[SPEAKER_01]: still haven't made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is this thing that where you
know it's it's so new for this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been you know traditionally in the
shadows you know to do an expo like this
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still something that people are still
just kind of testing the waters out and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting their feet in and seeing if you
know what they think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome man I'm glad you finally made
it dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah it's interesting walking around
seeing all these different companies that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen before and this is like
Las Vegas itself is a place where everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out of the woodworks and it's it's
cool to see new innovations new products
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know the same old faces too of
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree I feel like every time I come here
and I get away from whatever it is what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing at the booth and whatever you
know walking around every year I get
[SPEAKER_01]: reminded that there's never a point in
this industry where you feel like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortably at a place of knowing
everything or calling yourself a master
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always some new stuff coming out
that's about to blow my mind and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunate that when you're here for work
purposes we don't always get to dive into
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual trade show and get enough time
to walk around and see all the booths that
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual attendees do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well it's really cool there's so many
experts in each little niche but it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to be a true industry wide expert
these days with such a diverse flow of
[SPEAKER_02]: products and techniques and all of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to have a great
comprehensive grasp on the entire scope of
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're seeing people really hone in and
specialize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the lighting guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the ventilation guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the extract guy and really being
focused and if you pay attention to those
[SPEAKER_02]: experts you can kind of get a little bit
of a balance and that's what we're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know we're so entrenched in the
cultivation side being with Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys being with Cutting Edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important that we kind
of keep our eyes on the prize but keep up
[SPEAKER_02]: with what's going on in the industry
because in cultivation it's advising all
[SPEAKER_02]: the other portions like are you
cultivating for terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you cultivating for THC content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you cultivating hemp CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's so many different things like
Kevin you're in Tennessee so you see a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of a different side of the industry than
we see in the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about what's going on
in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: World in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well turning back to kind of the everybody
getting in on their niche and finding
[SPEAKER_00]: their specialty and going 100 percent into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you see the most successful
companies the ones that are you know
[SPEAKER_00]: playing to what they know consulting with
their existing base finding new customers
[SPEAKER_00]: and going that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the companies that try to do
it all are the ones that don't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a lot of that and it's nice to
you know play on each other's brands and
[SPEAKER_00]: build a community verse you know try to
try to create a one man show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation side of the eastern and
central U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately Tennessee is not blowing up
on the indoor and and craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp industry hemp industry is blowing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got I think thirty two hundred
cultivation license out there unlimited
[SPEAKER_00]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that's a crazy wild world with a
lot of fluctuations in you know price per
[SPEAKER_00]: pound and biomass and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are scaling back or or
or you know toning it down to be more in a
[SPEAKER_00]: safe zone rather than you know doing 60
acres and having to supply a 30 man labor
[SPEAKER_00]: crew and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are are turning it back
and going more green greenhouse and and
[SPEAKER_00]: craft style cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the central United States right now
we're seeing our biggest growth in areas
[SPEAKER_00]: like Missouri and Illinois and Florida and
then obviously Michigan and up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's nice to see some of these new
markets go live in the central U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: like Illinois per se where they have home
cultivation they have commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and then they you know the
culture is really starting to evolve
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's kind of on the whole
cultivation side takes me back to Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing a lot of energy a lot of
positive community growth and and just a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of really good things coming out of
the out of the Midwest and the central U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in those markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri is one just like that where they
have a really healthy home cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: model for caregivers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the retail markets healthy the culture
in the community of the home growers is
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and then you also have the the big
corporations and commercial facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in to do large scale production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited to see see this
cultivating in the Midwest and then even
[SPEAKER_00]: down into the southeast now with with
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that there is some preservation of
the medical small homegrown cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: style in these new emerging markets and
that's something we've seen in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: markets that's kind of scary and really
inhibits growth is when the people at home
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't allowed to grow and there's very
strict large scale regulation and all
[SPEAKER_02]: these hurdles and barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know in Florida you have to have had a
greenhouse license an existing greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: business for what the 80s since.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 years 30 40 years to actually get one
of the commercial don't have homegrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know which is you know I think that
that's one of the most negative things
[SPEAKER_02]: that an emerging market can do is limit in
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to let people come in fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that have been adversely
affected by uneven law enforcement I think
[SPEAKER_02]: is huge too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's no way that somebody that was
busted for growing cannabis in the 90s can
[SPEAKER_02]: effectively participate in Florida because
there's no way they could have owned a
[SPEAKER_02]: business while they were serving time for
having an ounce of pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really these barriers to entry to
the people that built the industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: fought for it for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really kind of bothers me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see places like Illinois where
you're allowed to do it on a small scale
[SPEAKER_02]: and you see people excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Missouri too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were saying that speaks to us as
cultivators people who got into it with
[SPEAKER_02]: three plants or two lights and built our
knowledge base from this like little germ
[SPEAKER_02]: of an idea of having to hide in a closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I love that the you know the aspect
of actually you know the home grows can
[SPEAKER_01]: put into the laws as these states come
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the medicinal aspect of consuming
the plant is obviously it's a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the part of growing the plant the
connection with actually growing plants is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you know there's so many
people that would never really take that
[SPEAKER_01]: on as a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is something so healing and
therapeutic and medicinal about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into the cultivation of a plant and
developing your relationship as a human to
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant or to your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's there's such a fine
balance there and as these states come
[SPEAKER_01]: online and actually you know push forward
on the home grow I think that that is such
[SPEAKER_01]: a crucial thing for our society to get
back into nature in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sean you've been with cutting edge
solutions for a good long while now but
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been in the industry for longer and
across a kind of interesting expanse of
[SPEAKER_02]: different occupations and niches in the
career.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it kind of floated around.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see in now and like in your
involvement in cutting edge solutions
[SPEAKER_02]: through these home grows like give us a
little bit of your perspective on the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so like eight eight to ten years ago
I was wrapping up in the northwest so
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon and Washington and it was right
around the time when they were becoming
[SPEAKER_03]: legal medical programs were rolling out
and I watched just like you guys were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about the rise and fall of
Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the biggest most emerging
markets especially for home grows and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of a sudden licenses came out and home
grow got canceled and it destroyed a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of not just the cultivators but our
industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow shops closed every single like half
of them closed up in the Seattle region
[SPEAKER_03]: and that really destroyed the whole
premise of why we wanted cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_03]: legal in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just wanted to not be messed with by
the government right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's become regulated not really
legal in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know as the industry is evolving
do you think we'd be talking about legal
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis in Missouri five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's really cool to see that
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's there's some good things
happening there's some bad things
[SPEAKER_03]: happening and it's kind of all across the
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the West Coast the saturation is there
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know farmers are kind of hurting out
there and I think the national model is
[SPEAKER_03]: adding to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know pounds from Oklahoma are going to
New York City all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that takes away from the California
growers that have been doing it for 30 40
[SPEAKER_03]: years on heritage farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean for what it's worth the same things
happening all across the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I feel like you
know it's going to lean heavily on you
[SPEAKER_01]: know federal legislation changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know at some point I feel like the
natural you know the ability to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper well crafted you know pound of
cannabis in California or Oregon or
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington in these drier climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that might change landscape scape
especially when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly shipping out you know overseas.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we were just talking I was talking
with Jose our sales rep who deals a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: with Mexico and Colombia for us and a
company in Colombia just signed a 60
[SPEAKER_03]: million dollar contract for exporting
flour to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can produce flour for pennies on
the gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you see these federal kind of
hurdles slowing everything down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really a big problem to me is that the
federal government's failure to act and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of support the greater national
distribution model is dismantling the
[SPEAKER_02]: existing industry in California and Oregon
and places that have been doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by dragging their feet they're creating
an environment where all these legacy
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are going to be underwater by the
time we open up to a an export model
[SPEAKER_02]: within the United States of being able to
throw a semi load of cannabis from
[SPEAKER_02]: different growers in California out to New
York out to Michigan out to these emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can get some traction and get a
lot of the people who are active in the
[SPEAKER_02]: community in the legislation writing these
state legislations and then pushing it up
[SPEAKER_02]: to the next level to their senators and
pushing for the federal we might be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get over this hurdle and preserve some
of this long time legacy farming and
[SPEAKER_02]: influence of the people from the 60s 70s
and 80s that built this industry that
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed us to be where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't be here talking about this in
Las Vegas at a public convention center if
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't for those people that risked
everything in all out domestic warfare to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce cannabis for all of us to consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hats off to all you legacy growers and
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean the Emerald Triangle as a
brand is in demand worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had the ability to market that
internationally it would you know set
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California up for a market that's
sustainable for decades if not you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and everyone in California was so
excited about we're the Napa we're up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt we're in the Emerald Triangle
we're going to be the Napa of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to everybody wants this but
they can't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and that's that's kind of our focal
point of moving into markets like Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are building their legislation on
export right now they are exporting to
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany and the UK and these markets that
only allow import into pharmacies and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's unique seeing that happen in other
parts of the world and you know we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow yeah and not being as familiar with
the international as you guys are I know
[SPEAKER_02]: you were just down in Columbia you just
did the big expo down in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah tell us more about that because if
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: could get off its ass and get some
legislation and we could be exporting to
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain and all these other places with our
California cannabis I think it would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: different world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally and what's really cool about
Columbia and Mexico especially the trade
[SPEAKER_03]: shows we went to it looks like Northern
California 15 years ago everybody wants
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge they're hungry for knowledge and
they want to do things the right way
[SPEAKER_03]: because those two countries specifically
don't trust GMOs they don't trust Monsanto
[SPEAKER_03]: they've banned Roundup they've banned GMOs
and that's the same model they're using
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis they want to do it the right
way but the people are super excited and
[SPEAKER_03]: the legislature is a little different than
than it is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Columbia is pretty much export only at
this point which is an interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: business model but they only export to
Canada and Germany which you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: think are the main places but Germany has
different pharmacies where they can
[SPEAKER_03]: basically make their own concoctions there
so whatever they bring in for material
[SPEAKER_03]: they can then make a cannabis pill or make
gummies in Germany but even Germany their
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis legislation isn't isn't there
either so it's like everyone's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: chasing the tail of the next thing to
happen and we're doing the same thing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the states too but it is cool to see
people passionate and hungry for knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: in these countries for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I'm interested to see the global
cannabis coalition and I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_02]: just coined something that doesn't exist
yet but that's what we need to see is you
[SPEAKER_02]: know lawmakers from every country from
every state especially that's legal
[SPEAKER_02]: medical or recreational coming together to
share a voice on a world scale to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about how to get past the past hundred
years of demonization of one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: effective healing plants on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: True that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I wish that we had 50 states that
were actually united and we could actually
[SPEAKER_03]: work together to make something like that
happen but we're so segregated as a
[SPEAKER_03]: country it makes it difficult to see how
that's actually gonna work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The progress has been slow we've been
saying that I'm sure there's people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 60s that never thought that they would be
here today to see this you know where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: at you know it's a it is slow but like you
know I think it was our second or third
[SPEAKER_01]: episode of Royal Grown Radio where we had
a guest on that was born and raised in
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia and I think we made a comment
that Virginia would probably be the last
[SPEAKER_01]: state of the 50 to go legal and boy do I
feel like a dumbass because I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I'm the one that said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah we are like Mississippi's on the
verge right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely is another who would have ever
imagined.
[SPEAKER_02]: No absolutely it's you know when you think
about these you know deeply entrenched you
[SPEAKER_02]: know original colonies with Virginia you
know there's some old boys mentality there
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's nice to see that emerging into
change but we just got to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors down in North Carolina and over
in Tennessee and kind of get them to see
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefits that it brings to the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean through the 90s Eastern or
Western Carolina Eastern Kentucky and
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern Tennessee were you know their own
sort of emerald triangle in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians so it would be nice to get to
play at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah let's like get the hills of Kentucky
into producing cannabis again because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's you know been a hotbed of cannabis
production in the East moonshiners and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis growers it goes hand-in-hand you
know those fuck the government hills
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah be a good special on the Discovery
Channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah right exactly it'll be on one day I
assure you I'd be a bit more fascinated to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how the hemp verse cannabis plays out
in places like that because I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: there are places humble being one of them
where they put the kibosh down on any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp growing because the cannabis
market itself is so strong and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of fear of you know
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in our market you know nobody
nobody's growing seeded hemp everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing seedless female either you know
feminized genetics I think some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strongest feminized genetics out there are
in the hemp industry I've grown four years
[SPEAKER_00]: consecutively with no hermaphrodites or
males and and like you know that is that
[SPEAKER_00]: is super impressive so you know these two
markets you know that's going at a scale
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and then and then you know our our
side of the industry is more more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fine-tuned crafting but you know we're
making great strides with the capability
[SPEAKER_00]: to do acres and acres of feminized seed
and auto flower stuff and just get the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and research and and fine-tune
consistency in genetics so so yeah I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about the fiber market but but
you know if that was ever to explode we
[SPEAKER_00]: would we would need a decortication
facilities within 20 miles of each fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: farm to make it you know logistical or or
production capabilities make sense so so I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't foresee that until there's a big
movement of you know subsidies or programs
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage decortication and processing
facilities for fiber I think that's still
[SPEAKER_00]: a ways away but that is truly exciting as
well and I think it'll have to be you know
[SPEAKER_00]: regions go after that and other regions go
after female flowers or or you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD is light years above people in
genetics they've created genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: will not will not pollinate and you know
even if there's a seeded out farm you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are making strides into you know
where open pollination is not even a
[SPEAKER_02]: threat so it's sterile females essentially
essentially yes and I like what you said
[SPEAKER_02]: about you know different markets and
different regions are gonna emerge at
[SPEAKER_02]: different rates and you see like Illinois
again and they're starting to see some
[SPEAKER_02]: traction on decorded decortification and
actually processing the fiber you got the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys at Heartland hemp and KLR genetics
and they're really doing a good job of
[SPEAKER_02]: actually trying to vertically integrate
and it's a slow process but you see them
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating large-scale smokable hemp
smokable CBD flower essentially and also
[SPEAKER_02]: going for larger scale fiber production
and I think you're gonna see that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: model emerging where they're gonna
privatize and vertically integrate for
[SPEAKER_02]: their own you know processing a fiber
in-house so they can farm on site process
[SPEAKER_02]: on site and move directly ideally to an
on-site or neighboring fiber processing or
[SPEAKER_02]: textile facility to actually produce wares
from the fibers but you're right it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: to be so local to make it cost-effective
this is a hemp shirt I want to wear hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff every day you know I want to wear
cannabis clothes well they actually are
[SPEAKER_01]: making really fine hemp clothing yeah we
were talking about that in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: episode where for years we all wanted to
wear it then you put it on you like Jesus
[SPEAKER_01]: I look like a goofball you know but that's
a really nice finely designed shirt yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Patagonia like they're killing it
with you got a hemp khakis and nice shirts
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff see that part of the industry I
feel like it's so wide open I mean there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much room for this plant to seriously
take over the planet on such a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: level when you're dealing with plastics
and fuels and stuff like that I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much potential for this thing
to just completely explode but again like
[SPEAKER_02]: you were saying Sean these are global
companies Patagonia that's a global
[SPEAKER_02]: company they're not reliant on US and so
you know tying back to that like are you
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing the same vigor down in Mexico and
Colombia for the hemp industry for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: down in Colombia the focus has been more
on the THC just for right now they can
[SPEAKER_03]: only really export extracts so everyone's
pushing for turps and pushing to extract
[SPEAKER_03]: and then export that but they're importing
hemp from Canada in Colombia to make
[SPEAKER_03]: clothing so it's very funny when you look
at it like that yeah like you were just
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about localization you'll see that
happen more but part of the the qualm or
[SPEAKER_03]: the the stopping point is always
legislature you know so if those things
[SPEAKER_03]: can change like on a local region in the
southeast we'll be making milling and
[SPEAKER_03]: creating textiles all in the same place
that we're growing hemp but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: globally that will start to change too a
lot of their you know the the sparkle in
[SPEAKER_00]: their eye lights up when with the hemp
side of things when you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: bioremediation of soil so sucking up
toxins of over overused and and over
[SPEAKER_00]: overproduced farmland and and and you know
just the the areas of our past that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: polluted some of our farmland areas of the
country so you see a lot of interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: that down there and and yeah it's exciting
you know a tropical climate and a South
[SPEAKER_00]: American climate would be perfect for
fiber production and stuff as well and
[SPEAKER_03]: about 40% of the land in Mexico is
completely contaminated from herbicide
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticide and fertilizer use or overuse so
they can't even really grow corn in the
[SPEAKER_03]: places they were 10-20 years ago because
the land is so fallow but to pull up the
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminants starting a hemp program to
bioremediate that soil you can get 20 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 percent of that land back and then be
able to use it for agriculture again
[SPEAKER_02]: that's huge yeah it's such an effective
bio accumulator and you can get rid of a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the the tissue that holds all of
those toxins and still use the fiber and
[SPEAKER_02]: still use some of that plant in an
effective way remediate the land grow
[SPEAKER_02]: something of value and actually move
forward and you know a conscious way to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve land again I think that's insane
and fantastic and we got to spread the
[SPEAKER_03]: word about this sort of thing yeah and
like all of us standing in this room
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of where we started with the
industry you know maybe we started growing
[SPEAKER_03]: weed because we like to smoke weed but at
the same time there's always that
[SPEAKER_03]: connection between the earth and the plant
and yourself we didn't start growing weed
[SPEAKER_03]: to make money maybe but you know that was
just an added bonus it was a quick second
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah for sure for sure but the whole the
whole point of having ranches up and
[SPEAKER_03]: humble and being out in the woods and
living in a tent and being connected with
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant was because that was the
experience we wanted we didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: just rip up the land plant in the ground
and then maybe not grow there again two
[SPEAKER_02]: years later because it's destroyed you
know yeah it wasn't out of convenience or
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to live in a lap of luxury like
you said we're living in tents on the side
[SPEAKER_02]: of mountains far from actual good water
sources you're pulling from springs and
[SPEAKER_02]: having to check your water lines every day
and like really live living in the land
[SPEAKER_02]: off the land in the middle of nowhere so
many of these people built from the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: up with empty 40 acre parcels with just an
old logging road and learn how to cut wood
[SPEAKER_01]: and build water boxes and you know trap
you know pests and rodents I mean you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn everything from from the ground
up to be able to pull this all
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully and it wasn't living in the
lap of luxury like we weren't all canvas
[SPEAKER_02]: ballers kicking our feet up on the side of
the hot tub watching the plants grow
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not at all what it was like
definitely not definitely not yeah quite
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite yeah you know sustained
sustainability and the focus on getting
[SPEAKER_00]: there is you know what drives a lot of us
a royal gold with the sustainable media
[SPEAKER_00]: and then hydroponic cultivation I think
that is one fuel that's always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to burn in this industry and and
keep the fire going because you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us all purpose to continue to better
ourselves so a hundred percent and like
[SPEAKER_02]: what cutting edge is doing to innovate
more organic liquid fertilizers for
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic applications and you know using
sustainable mediums like cocoa to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: create a balance of this is a soil type
cultivation process but it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic we're doing all we can to
minimize our water consumption to minimize
[SPEAKER_02]: water contamination nutrient runoff
nutrient outflow we want the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: consume everything we're putting into it
and not be wasting any of these resources
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah and we you know we've been pretty
preaching foliar applications of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: additives for 20 years now and it's
finally catching on finally the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to understand the plant takes 80
to 200 times as much nutrition through the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata and you know that keeps your
reservoir clean the plants getting
[SPEAKER_00]: available nutrients you can add organics
in you know you know every day we're
[SPEAKER_00]: making waves and it's nice to see some of
these techniques catching on in commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: applications man I feel like we could go
on all day we've got another little while
[SPEAKER_02]: here we've got some other guests about to
join us we got the THC girls the high
[SPEAKER_02]: country girls from Florida yeah come and
join us here next we'll have to get you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys back on and have more conversation
you know at a different time maybe in the
[SPEAKER_02]: studio where we can dig deeper into some
of these for sure we'll get a uncle John
[SPEAKER_03]: to come out too and we can all tell the
stories that sounds great thanks so much
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah thank you guys yeah this is a
pleasure thank you always good to just
[SPEAKER_03]: hang out with my boys you know we've seen
you guys all week for sure we'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great time I love you my boy, I love you
