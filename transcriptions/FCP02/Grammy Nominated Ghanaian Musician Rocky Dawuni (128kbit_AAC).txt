[SPEAKER_03]: Rocky, welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an honor to be here and join you in
this beautiful, nice, cool place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful day, and thank you for
coming down to the backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, why don't you tell our listeners a
little bit about where you grew up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in Ghana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghana is situated in the west coast of
Africa, you know, a country of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a little over 30 million people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghana was also the first African country
to be independent, so Ghana has always
[SPEAKER_05]: been, you know, at the forefront of many
amazing innovations and advancement on the
[SPEAKER_05]: continent, and people, we like to call it
the gateway to Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was born on a military barracks at
the time, so my father was part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghanaian army, and at the same time,
too, he came from a traditional royal
[SPEAKER_05]: family, so I had, you know, a combination
of tradition, and at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so I grew up, you know, in an
environment of tradition, which I was
[SPEAKER_05]: getting from my home, and then also,
because my father was in the military,
[SPEAKER_05]: discipline, you know, and then at the same
time, too, it was really at a time when
[SPEAKER_05]: the Ghanaian military was in political
power, so I also grew up in an environment
[SPEAKER_05]: that was politically charged, and all of
those elements became, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a way of seeding who I became,
you know, and I became somebody who loved
[SPEAKER_05]: music, somebody who loved politics,
somebody who loved engaging the world,
[SPEAKER_05]: and at the same time, somebody who is
proud of the cultural background and
[SPEAKER_05]: foundations that I grew up from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And was that near Accra?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the capital, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The capital of Ghana is Accra,
and then where I grew up is Temma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Temma is actually part of Accra.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like the Malibu of Accra from
the map.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at Ghana last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, Temma was like a place,
you know, Temma has the port, but the
[SPEAKER_05]: barracks was a little far from where the
port was, and first, they call it the
[SPEAKER_05]: first infantry brigade, you know,
so it was, you know, it was a very
[SPEAKER_05]: strategic military base for the Ghanaian
military, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: growing up there was, you know,
it was kind of a very sheltered
[SPEAKER_05]: environment, but at the same time,
too, it was a place that I felt provided
[SPEAKER_05]: me the opportunity to, you know,
grow and be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: learn certain things that have become very
key to who I've become, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the sense of discipline, the sense of,
you know, constantly wanting to strive and
[SPEAKER_05]: achieve, and then also a drive,
you know, that became key part of really
[SPEAKER_05]: my musical journey, you know, starting
from Ghana, and building my base in Ghana,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then, you know, expanding my musical
reach to beyond the confines of Ghana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of your musical background,
who were your earliest musicians?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were your musical influences?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, the thing was that they
were, there was the traditional music,
[SPEAKER_05]: so everybody that grows up in Ghana or any
part of Africa, you are first exposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: your cultural music, because, you know,
our traditions and culture are very,
[SPEAKER_05]: very deep, and we all come from deep
tribes, so my tribal music was something
[SPEAKER_05]: that I was exposed to earlier on,
but then, at the same time, too,
[SPEAKER_05]: also exposed to the music of other tribes,
you know, living in Tema.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tema was an area that was the traditional
area of Ghana's, you know, the tribe there
[SPEAKER_05]: was called the Gaans, so Ghana music was
very prominent, you heard it around,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then, at the same time, too,
other traditional Ghanaian musical forms
[SPEAKER_05]: were there, so those were the initial
musical foundation, and then there was
[SPEAKER_05]: also high-life music, which was kind of
Ghana's version of the pop music,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so my initial heroes were the
high-life, you know, heroes of those days,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so African Brothers was one of
the first bands that I kind of gravitated
[SPEAKER_05]: towards, and African Brothers,
their high-life variant, too, was the
[SPEAKER_05]: foundation of that style that became
popular all over West Africa, and also was
[SPEAKER_05]: the musical form that eventually evolved
into Afrobeat and all these other styles
[SPEAKER_05]: that most people right now are hearing and
are used to, you know, so from then
[SPEAKER_05]: onwards, then I became exposed to reggae
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just gonna ask you,
can you tell us when you first heard
[SPEAKER_03]: reggae and Bob Marley?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, well, what happened was that,
you know, to give more of a broader
[SPEAKER_05]: background was that reggae music,
you know, Ghana has an ancestral
[SPEAKER_05]: connection to Jamaica, and also because of
Ghana's Pan-African history, our first
[SPEAKER_05]: president, Kwame Nkrumah was very,
he studied here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_05]: so he came back to Ghana, Ghana became the
first African country to be independent,
[SPEAKER_05]: so his whole idea immediately was
connecting Ghana to the diaspora.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first president of Ghana, Kwame
Nkrumah, he was actually named the African
[SPEAKER_05]: of the Millennium.
[SPEAKER_05]: He led Ghana to its independence,
Ghana being the first country in Africa to
[SPEAKER_05]: be independent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what year?
[SPEAKER_05]: 1957.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and when he became president,
his initial idea was connecting Africa to
[SPEAKER_05]: the diaspora because he lived in America,
he was influenced by, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: their Pan-Africanist movement that was
going on, W.E.B., Dubois, Marcus Garvey,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of those, so he wanted to create a
model African country.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of Jamaicans came from that
geographic area because obviously,
[SPEAKER_05]: in those days, we didn't have those,
you know, it wasn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: ordered into different countries,
that was a colonial thing that was
[SPEAKER_05]: created, but most Jamaicans came from
tribes that were situated in that area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Ethiopia, you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not in Ethiopia, it was mostly
West Africa, West Africa, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so there was that, I felt that there
was like that connection, that innate
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding, the DNA of the music also
could be comprehended there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so Rege kind of took root there,
and also the messages that Rege was,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, kind of projecting were about
elevation of African ideals, African
[SPEAKER_05]: culture, you know, blackness, empowerment
of Africa, and I think that because the
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghanaian military seen themselves to as
liberating, the greatest of the continent,
[SPEAKER_05]: the music took root there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, you know, in the barracks,
you heard a lot of Rege music,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter Tosh, Burning Spear, you know,
those early forefathers of the sound were
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very popular there, so obviously Bob
Marley was a very, you know, undeniable
[SPEAKER_05]: presence there, and for me, I was not
fully, you know, I was into other music,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not kind of aware of Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of his name and all of that,
but I was not really a big Rege fan at
[SPEAKER_05]: that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: What changed it was that there was a
military band that used to do cover songs,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so I was kind of, I had kind of
figured out that music was something that
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to do, so I gravitated towards
anywhere that I could find music being
[SPEAKER_05]: played or anything, so I ended up starting
to spend time in the rehearsal space of
[SPEAKER_05]: the military band, so when the album
Uprising came out, Bob Marley's album,
[SPEAKER_05]: they were rehearsing the album to play the
album, and the song that I remember,
[SPEAKER_05]: I went there and then they were trying to
learn Coming In From The Cold,
[SPEAKER_05]: so, from the cold, you know, and I
remember, I was just like, wow,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a really cool song, I wonder who
sang it, you know, because I had not heard
[SPEAKER_05]: the song, but I heard the band rehearsing
it, so, you know, the guy, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they would start, you know, and then the
bass line and then how the song started,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, just like, this is brilliant,
you know, so afterwards, I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: wow, that's Bob Marley, you know,
and so that led me into you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the music, and not long afterwards,
you know, Bob passed on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and... 81.
[SPEAKER_05]: 81, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was like something that,
you know, really resonated with me,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was an artist trying to also find my
voice, and coming from the military
[SPEAKER_05]: barracks and believing in also using my
music as a means to project social issues,
[SPEAKER_05]: political issues, and also empowering,
you know, my people, and also using that
[SPEAKER_05]: as a cultural conversation with the world,
Reggae made sense as kind of a music that
[SPEAKER_05]: I gravitated, and obviously Bob Marley's
voice, but in addition to artists like
[SPEAKER_05]: Fela Kuti, who were also very popular at
that time, and the soldiers had kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: love-hate relationship with Fela Kuti's
music, because he sang against the
[SPEAKER_05]: Nigerian army, but the Ghanaian army loved
him, you know, and so you hear songs like
[SPEAKER_05]: Zombie, that Nigerian army, it was against
Nigerian army, but the Ghanaian army was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, we're not Nigerian army.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was wondering who that was about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, so... Like water gets no
enemy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, water gets no enemy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was also, you know, like a
derogatory term that people used to call
[SPEAKER_05]: the soldiers were zombie, you know,
and soldiers hated that name, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: because... Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so those styles, you know,
so Fela and Bob Marley, I would say,
[SPEAKER_05]: were the popular ones that inspired me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can see both of their influences
in your music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yes, you know, but underneath it
was like also the traditional music,
[SPEAKER_05]: the cultural music, and then the high life
music of Ghana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And was reggae always legal to play in
Ghana?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, reggae music was very
popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that, like, Lucky Debay in
South Africa had to wait until,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, it became legal, I think,
at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: South Africa still was under, you know,
apartheid and all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of things that kind of really
ignited the consciousness of the people
[SPEAKER_05]: was, you know, was prohibited because they
were fighting against not only physically
[SPEAKER_05]: restricting the people's progress,
but they're also fighting the people's
[SPEAKER_05]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And reggae kind of ignited and opened the
mindset of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were afraid of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were afraid of that, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you know a group named Osibisa?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Osibisa was like traditional
heroes of Ghana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because they were the
traditional heroes of Africa because they
[SPEAKER_05]: were actually the first African band to
take African music and kind of bring it
[SPEAKER_05]: into the mainstream of global music.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were from Ghana.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the group started from Ghana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then eventually, a lot of the members
became some of my mentors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Teddy Osei and Mac Tonto became very
close friends who supported me,
[SPEAKER_05]: actually, in the early parts of my music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are, you know, they took high
life music and also integrated it with
[SPEAKER_05]: Western sounds and created a fun,
I mean, they were amazing live,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they brought like also the
cultural aspect of Ghanaian music to and
[SPEAKER_05]: presented in a way that could be
comprehended by audiences beyond Africa,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Osibisa is a very, you know,
they're heroes of Ghana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghanaian music, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, didn't one of their members move to
Venice, Lofty, Assisi, Amow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know that guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when did you actually start playing
music and writing songs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Writing started way earlier, you know,
because I remember being a little kid from
[SPEAKER_05]: around the age of five years, you know,
I recognized that ability.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I started making up songs,
you know, I will hear something,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'll make it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will, you know, hear melodies,
gravitate towards the melody and start
[SPEAKER_05]: really analyzing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it comes to when people ask me
about songwriting, I say, it came,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was there, I felt that it was always
part of me, like I was born with that
[SPEAKER_05]: already in me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at five, I started recognizing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then five, yeah, around the age of
five.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then by seven years, I was making up
my own songs, but they were never things
[SPEAKER_05]: that I realized that, you know,
I was going to do it professionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was, I was making them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And professionally, I'll say by the time I
got to, let's say 12 years, that is when I
[SPEAKER_05]: sat for my common entrance exam two
secondary school in Ghana, by the time I
[SPEAKER_05]: got to secondary school, I was already
singing stuff that were original stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was doing it without telling people
that I was the one that composed them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I would do is that I usually will,
I was kind of the noisiest kid around,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and I'll hold little parties,
you know, people will be playing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, this and then I'll sing and I'll
sing popular songs and stuff and add it to
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, you know, I always created that
environment wherever I was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that was kind of part of
nurturing my songwriting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I got to, I remember when I got
to secondary school, which is probably the
[SPEAKER_05]: college equivalent here, that was when I
started seriously putting structure to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then you were writing in secondary
school?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, in secondary school.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what the way the writing was was
because, you know, because we never had,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was hard to have access to guitars and
instruments because those were expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your father would never any like,
you want to be a musician?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to school.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of how things were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Musicians were seeing us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, those people, you know, they just
follow women and smoke a lot and drink a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they like wayward people and all of,
you know, that was kind of like prevailing
[SPEAKER_05]: mindset, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So life of a musician.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So being a musician was not something
that, you know, you go out and say that's
[SPEAKER_05]: a career choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a path that you got to
believe in it and you got to make
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody accept it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the kind of style of music was what I
figured I hear you call beatbox.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started by you create the song and
also I could hear the instruments in my
[SPEAKER_05]: head.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I had a few friends who were also
taking it by what I would do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will have one hum the bass line,
one play the drum and then we'll just make
[SPEAKER_05]: up the songs like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of how we started
creating structure to what was in our mind
[SPEAKER_05]: and started writing songs because we
didn't have instruments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my first albums that eventually I did,
that was kind of the style that I
[SPEAKER_05]: eventually evolved into my first demo you
know, I remember when I was doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: demo, a friend had two tape recorders,
you know, and then another friend had like
[SPEAKER_05]: a nice cassette.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're bouncing back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went to her and I was just like,
you know, that's your cassette.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, no, no, no, don't talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My cassette.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not giving it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I'm trying to do a demo so I can
go and get a producer for my music,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if you give it to me,
I will, you know, pay you back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I ever paid back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first demo was putting the tape in
there, you know, recording, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: recording, having somebody sing and then
me and singing it directly into the tape
[SPEAKER_05]: with somebody coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then afterwards we played that to
another cassette and then we added stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of how we did it and then
created, you know, the first demo for
[SPEAKER_05]: people to hear that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is a song.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that's how the bass goes and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what it did for me, too,
was that it allowed me to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: develop production instincts that whenever
I wrote songs, I could easily go into a
[SPEAKER_05]: studio and then say, OK, this is how the
bass goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how the drum goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how that goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Created that instinct, you know,
for me to be able to be a good arranger
[SPEAKER_05]: and also a good producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, your albums now sound very well
produced, I must say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the the musicians are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[SPEAKER_02]: African Thrilla African Thrilla African
Thrilla,
[SPEAKER_03]: from your Grammy nominated 2015 album,
Branches of the Same Tree, is like an
[SPEAKER_03]: anthemic dancehall tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the video is a visual experience,
a cinematic experience like so many of
[SPEAKER_03]: your other videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we talk about making that video?
[SPEAKER_03]: And your videos in general?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I came to spend time in
America, you know, lived here and started
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing, I mean, everybody's impressed with
what artists like Michael Jackson did with
[SPEAKER_05]: videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, videos became a means by which
you could tell a new story beyond what the
[SPEAKER_05]: music is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so you use that to expand on the
concept of what exactly the art,
[SPEAKER_05]: the music is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So personally, too, I kind of gravitated
towards that idea that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: whenever you were doing a music video,
the song was the starting point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have a great director,
too, who has a great vision, they could
[SPEAKER_05]: also help to really push.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for African Thrilla, you know,
a very close friend of mine, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Glenn Wilson, he was actually an amazing
photographer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's done a lot of my photography.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also directed a previous video that
was called African Reggae Fever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was also kind of very well shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was shot like in Venice and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're walking down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, walking down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these girls playing the guitar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people doing loops and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful and well, well produced,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was, you know, like his visual,
he was very specific because he was a
[SPEAKER_05]: photographer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a photographer, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knew how, you know, how to frame things
and also get deeper into the texture of
[SPEAKER_05]: the images.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a great video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it was made in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after I saw the video,
I had to go back and check to see when
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Panther was made, because,
OK, it's maybe some, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: reoccurring African costumes in some of
the women.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you know, it just probably,
I wonder, you know, he visually,
[SPEAKER_05]: he visually, too, because the song was
called African Thriller, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: so because African Thriller, you know,
we're thinking, OK, Michael Jackson,
[SPEAKER_05]: we were thinking Thriller in Manila,
you know, that's boxing, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was paying homage to also African
create African and African-American
[SPEAKER_05]: creatives who have excelled from Mohammed
Ali to Michael Jackson.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, too, Africa,
where the big boxing match between Foreman
[SPEAKER_05]: and Mohammed Ali happened in Zaire,
you know, with all James Brown was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a combination of music and also
boxing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the same time, using that to
create a conversation piece between the
[SPEAKER_05]: diaspora and also the motherland in a way
that is fun, is inclusive and using dance
[SPEAKER_05]: as a metaphor of boxing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you step in the ring, but you're not
going there to go and fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going there to showcase how,
you know, your dance, your moves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so philosophically, those it was
a great concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we just knew that, you know,
with Glenn, you know, he could,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so he needed a space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember we we filmed it in a in a
boxing ring in Pacoima.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he brought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, you would think it was
filmed in Africa, you know, and that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: magic of, you know, film.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he brought and we got, you know,
amazing choreographers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, yeah, the the lady who
choreographed, you know, the the the video
[SPEAKER_05]: right now, the moves, you know,
choreographs for a lot of big stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we had some of the best talent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and friends, you know,
it was it was a kind of a family affair.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously my manager, Carrie Sullivan,
who was also very involved in kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: really putting all of that together and
making it all happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was it was filled with spirit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was filled with a sense of truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also filled with vision,
pain, homage at the same time to reaching
[SPEAKER_05]: out into the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that is what and then the song
itself to kind of was that it was a
[SPEAKER_05]: combination of African traditional music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Music, dance hall, Afrobeat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and also pay homage to
like, you know, you don't you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: as a human living being, you got to move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's life, you know, and that is all
depicted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a little Fela Kuti in that song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Afrobeat aspect of Fela Kuti.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Fela Kuti comes from high life
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as an African, a lot of times,
most people know that Fela Kuti who
[SPEAKER_05]: experience high life and all the true
Afrobeat by our experience from the same
[SPEAKER_05]: Wellsprings that Fela.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also experience from.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my reference point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your new video, Beautiful People,
which is on your latest album Voices of
[SPEAKER_03]: Boon Boon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boon Boon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boon Boon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boon Boon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Volume one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dedicated to the people of Ghana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that village where it was filmed
special to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not Pacoima.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very far from Pacoima.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is my ancestral village.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is where my the village was founded
by my great-grandfather, my grandfather.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of the big thriving villages
and my family has been the royal family of
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my family has been the chiefs.
[SPEAKER_05]: My father was the chief and then now my
older brother is the chief there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh and the idea of Beautiful People to was
to you know to find the beauty in
[SPEAKER_05]: everyday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Life and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody has beauty in them and I feel
that a lot of times we try to look for the
[SPEAKER_05]: beauty outside and also in terms of
outward things that are not real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I felt that I didn't needed
to use that video to show that everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: should appreciate their origins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should appreciate where they come from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should appreciate the people who make them
who they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: The community that to some extent gave
birth to who they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the video I went back to find the
beauty in the community to find the beauty
[SPEAKER_05]: in the everyday things that people were
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the look of the people,
the feel of the place.
Great look.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great feel and then the song to you know.
Great spirit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great spirit and in doing so to inspire
other people to go to your origins.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, honor where you come from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honor who you are because that is who you
are.
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it was a it was a song that
in telling my story, I felt that it
[SPEAKER_05]: allowed people to to tell their own
stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a great song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great video too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_05]: I dedicate this song for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I dedicate this song for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come and sing along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my question was, where did the horn
section come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the horn section.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that horn section.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the horn section is... It seemed like
it was almost Afro-Cuban.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because the trumpet is from Cuba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The trombones is from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the saxophone is
African-American.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had, it was not a Ghanaian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was like the diasporian cast and
different dimensions of the diaspora that
[SPEAKER_05]: played the horn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, like sinking deep into the
song, there's so many different elements
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of gave it such, you know,
deep spirituals and cultural significance
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was a song that was,
its inception was from Ghana, but then
[SPEAKER_05]: that remake also took into consideration
all the diaspora sounds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bringing it right back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many albums have you released so far,
Rocky?
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven albums and then an EP.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the EP, Voice of Bumbo, was the EP that
just was released, actually, that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been working on that has beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a volume two coming up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Volume two is going to come up,
but it's not necessarily going to follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably, the next one will probably
be an album.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also work for humanitarian and
environmental organizations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which ones and what do you do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, from, shall I say,
growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, and also growing up in, talking about
my military, growing up in a military
[SPEAKER_05]: barracks that was politicized,
we were constantly exposed to issues that
[SPEAKER_05]: required attention because the Ghanaian
military was in power then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were dealing with national issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: So wherever I walked, you know,
like, you know, wherever I found a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of soldiers gathered and, you know,
after work and they were chatting,
[SPEAKER_05]: the conversations were always about
development.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were about how to make the country
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those conversations, I was privy to all
of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at an early age, I was figuring,
trying to figure out how I could also make
[SPEAKER_05]: a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time too, most of the
Ghanaian soldiers too were part of the UN
[SPEAKER_05]: peacekeeping force because when I was a
little kid, there was the Arab-Israeli
[SPEAKER_05]: peace issue that was going on in the
Middle East.
[SPEAKER_05]: Six day war?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was that after that maybe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think more, I don't know whether
it was Yom Kippur or one, but most of the
[SPEAKER_05]: soldiers were kind of stabilizing force
that was sent to Egypt, part of the UN
[SPEAKER_05]: force to go there and, you know,
be in between all the, all the feuding
[SPEAKER_05]: countries, you know, to try and maintain
stability there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so whenever they came, you know,
they were talking about all these
[SPEAKER_05]: divisions and how, you know, they could,
they could be, so there was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sponging all of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The United Nations, local politics,
you know, trying to make a change.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time too, the influences that
all these soldiers who were exposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: that part of the world were bringing right
back home.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were not bringing it to Ghana,
they were bringing it right into the
[SPEAKER_05]: confines of the military barracks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we lived in a very tight place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it started building that, that need in
me to be a voice for social
[SPEAKER_05]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be, to utilize whatever gifts that I
felt God had given me to, to, to help
[SPEAKER_05]: society advance and also to speak truth to
power.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time to use it as a means
to empower people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also felt that it's one thing
writing about it, it's one thing talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about it, it's one thing sitting on a
stage and writing lyrics about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only make some of those changes
to, if you're able to translate what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're saying into reality by being on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Action.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're back with Rocky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for putting up with our technical
difficulties here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how is Accra the capital of Ghana?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what is it like and how is the
government nowadays?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the Accra right now,
you know, just like every teaming urban
[SPEAKER_05]: capital, you know, it's, it's a lot of
traffic, you know, a lot of congestion
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, dealing with issues too of,
you know, trying to maintain when,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, people are moving from different
areas of the country into every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming in, you know, so, you know,
when it has to do with, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: issues of housing, food, you know,
all of those problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are going on, you know, but, you know,
underneath all of that too, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: people are going about their lives like
everywhere, you know, but since the
[SPEAKER_05]: crisis, the global crisis happened,
what it has done is that it literally
[SPEAKER_05]: killed a lot of the nightlife,
which Ghana was, had been struggling in a
[SPEAKER_05]: way to kind of bring that back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really killed that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now people are just trying to,
you know, get their lives back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get back to normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get back to, you know, a semblance of
normality right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the rest of the world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate to ask about another city,
but you wrote about Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You love Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to ask you, what do you
love about Nairobi?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in Kenya, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, actually that song was,
was a metaphor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what happened was that Kenya had a big
political issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the issue is, you know,
is steeped in the history of Kenya,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'm not going to go deeply into,
but there are two big political factions
[SPEAKER_05]: that have been kind of fighting for power
a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's been one faction that has
been in power for that length.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and all these factions to revolve
around tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one faction is two tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another faction is one major tribe with
other minor tribes around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not only political, but it's also
steeped in cultural and identity and all
[SPEAKER_05]: of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody will remember that Kenya had
elections and that election was contested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was like a big,
huge problem where people started
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The country nearly fell apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the UN, Kofi Annan and everybody
went in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was between Kenyatta and also Raila
Odinga.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when that period went through and they
kind of got to a point of understanding an
[SPEAKER_05]: agreement and they were just about to do
another elections after a few years of
[SPEAKER_05]: stabilizing the situation, you know,
in which the international court of
[SPEAKER_05]: justice were all involved in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kenyatta was actually at first,
he was going to be charged with crimes
[SPEAKER_05]: against his people and all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But eventually all of that was resolved
and they decided to do an election.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was invited to Kenya at that time as
part of a peace initiative with the Red
[SPEAKER_05]: Cross of Kenya to come and work with
musicians and all of that as part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The peace building and also trying to,
you know, create a peaceful foundation for
[SPEAKER_05]: that election that was just about to
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I traveled in, I, you know,
with the Red Cross, you know, we went into
[SPEAKER_05]: areas like Kibera, meeting, you know,
to meetings with various musicians,
[SPEAKER_05]: various groups, you know, promoting peace,
promoting inter-tribal, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: connection and then also an ideal of a
united Kenya, an ideal of a united people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whilst I was going through all of
this, I felt that there was such a deep
[SPEAKER_05]: rift between the people that was not
political, but was cultural and tribal.
[SPEAKER_05]: To a point that Ghana's was not even,
you know, Ghana's division when it comes
[SPEAKER_05]: to the tribal culture was not even that
deep, but Kenya's was deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, what can I as a musician
and as somebody who's here as part of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, getting a snapshot into this
issue, what can I do to help the healing
[SPEAKER_05]: process?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, wow, you know, it has to be
a song.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't want a song to that was like
obvious, like, hey, you know, you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: come together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's apolitical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's apolitical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, what does all Kenyans like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do they all agree on that we're not
going to fight about?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, people and I felt like,
wow, you know, Nairobi, actually,
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody was proud of their capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, every Kenyan, you know,
regardless of whether the person was Luo,
[SPEAKER_05]: Kalenjin or, you know, any other tribe,
you know, they were they were proud of
[SPEAKER_05]: Nairobi, you know, and like, yeah,
you know, you know, Nairobi, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody was like, Nairobi is like one of
the most beautiful, you know, capitals in
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa and all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a certain pride to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, OK, maybe what I needed to
do was write a song about something that
[SPEAKER_05]: unites everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they use that as a premise to speak
about harmony and unity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a great song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the song Nairobi was kind of birthed
out of that intention and objective.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to wonder, you know,
because you did keep the politics out of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, here we are at Kalihi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I feel I have to ask you,
is is Erb legal in Ghana?
[SPEAKER_05]: Erb is not legal in Ghana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many African countries, you know,
have, you know, because African countries
[SPEAKER_05]: inherited a lot of their constitution and
a lot of their judiciary, judiciary from
[SPEAKER_05]: the colonial, colonial entities,
powers that were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so Erb was also something that,
you know, all around, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Erb and hemp were banned in most of those
places.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was also replicated in these
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to some extent, it also wrapped around
people thinking that Erb causes craziness.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was like everybody said that
most of the mad people in the street,
[SPEAKER_05]: they always say, oh, they're all we
smokers, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was kind of a false narrative
that I think has kind of its roots from
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was also perpetuated all over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was something that was seen as a
serious type of stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something that was seen as deviant,
you know, and also that it was also
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It causes illness.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was terrible for the community and the
society.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, everybody was against it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the musicians, it was popular within
the music industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Musicians are the creative community.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why everybody was like,
oh, you want to be a musician.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, those people, they just smoke
weed and all of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wanted their daughters to marry a
musician because they're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not stable people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're stoners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coach, if you don't want your daughters to
be stoners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have married musicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most African countries were very
adamant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it got also, one way or another,
it got wrapped into the religious
[SPEAKER_05]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the religious establishment also
constantly is preaching against,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, people who are conservative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to say that people who,
you know, anytime they're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: people who didn't make it in life,
they're like, you know, they ended up
[SPEAKER_05]: being a weed smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: They ended up being this drinking and
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was seen as people who never were able
to make it into, you know, the society.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fell off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always blamed on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that stigma has survived up till now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although when you look critically,
there's a lot of people who are beyond
[SPEAKER_05]: that stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Artists and even people in, you know,
government places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Attitudes will change, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but now it's changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's changing because other parts of the
world are doing so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then most of these economies still are
seeing the numbers from other economies
[SPEAKER_05]: that are, you know, but the political will
is still lacking from most of the leaders
[SPEAKER_05]: because they feel that if you legalize it,
first of all, you're going to lose your
[SPEAKER_05]: base because it's a conservative base.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to lose that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of them are walking, you know,
kind of a fine line between it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But some countries that are
decriminalizing the farming, of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are not legalizing the use of it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then recently in Ghana too,
it's amazing that I'm doing this interview
[SPEAKER_05]: right now because just about a week ago,
the Ghanaian government also came out and
[SPEAKER_05]: said that they are just on the verge of
allowing the farming of hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 0.3% THC, you know, and we feel that
it is a major step because obviously if
[SPEAKER_05]: they feel a certain concern about,
you know, legalizing it and then all of a
[SPEAKER_05]: sudden everybody's walking around the
streets, you know, smoking, which was
[SPEAKER_05]: actually, you know, to even diverge to a
funny situation was that the first time it
[SPEAKER_05]: was announced that the government was
thinking about doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The following day, social media,
everybody was, people were putting things
[SPEAKER_05]: of lighting on there and all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just like, Hey guys,
a little bit too soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit too soon because that's
not what these guys are talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're actually kind of exposing the
greatest fear, you know, of everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: walking around and lighting it up,
you know, and smoking in the streets and
[SPEAKER_05]: all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just relax and allow them the space to be
able to, you know, move this along,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some pace of some kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but, but, you know, it's
something that it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's ridiculous that most of these
countries are not seeing it as a means by
[SPEAKER_05]: which they could deal with the adept
issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could restart the economy,
money, one thing, and at the same time to
[SPEAKER_05]: the health benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, CB, you know, the, the,
the, the, the nutrition from the seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the fiber from hemp and all of
that, you know, these are all things that
[SPEAKER_05]: can be transformative for economies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I make my, my clothes out of
all the stems and seeds from my previous
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be nice, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, but that's, that's, you know,
hemp material and hemp fiber and hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's, it's, it's, it's,
it's incredible, you know, so I feel that,
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that, you know, if that is what
we're comfortable with, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it also has transformative benefits and we
should take a step there and then
[SPEAKER_05]: eventually, you know, all the others,
you know, will come along.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, are we still rolling here on both of
these guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe can you check them out real quick?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that red button.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And check over there, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going and this is going to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few more questions and then maybe just
for insurance, we'll go back and do one or
[SPEAKER_03]: two more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, all right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you have an amazing band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you, are they always the same people
or?
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that a little bit.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the thing is that it's very hard
these days to keep a standing band.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, uh, the economics of the,
you know, the industry does not allow most
[SPEAKER_05]: of the time, especially when you live,
you're operating from major cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say I'm operating from Los Angeles
or I'm operating from Accra, Ghana,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, you know, to hold together a band,
you need console.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also need to be touring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also need to be touring, you know,
and then the touring dates too,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so you maintain a group of
people that you work with that are your
[SPEAKER_05]: band by the same time to most of them also
work with other, other bands, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: great musicians.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, great musicians, you know,
to work with musicians on that level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's, um, you know, they're also
equally, um, you know, in demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: In everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to come to terms with that,
you know, but I have, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a solid band, uh, here in the
United States and then also a solid band
[SPEAKER_05]: in Ghana that I work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so plans for touring now that things
are opening up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we are hoping so, but you know,
the thing is that things are opening up,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're not, the touring world has not
necessarily like in America, it looks like
[SPEAKER_05]: things are opening up much more faster
than in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really not much going on in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, basically our, you know,
touring and booking agencies over there
[SPEAKER_05]: have said that literally just forget the
year, you know, because nothing is really
[SPEAKER_05]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from the news too, we are seeing
that Europe is even getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: things are even shutting down more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, instead of opening up,
you know, so, so for me, I am seeing that
[SPEAKER_05]: music and artistry and all that we do,
um, you know, has to evolve.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is a saying that,
uh, it's actually, uh, in Ashanti in tree
[SPEAKER_05]: proverb that say, um, when, uh,
the hunter learns to shoot without missing
[SPEAKER_05]: the birds will have to learn to fly
without perching.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that whenever you're giving any
situation, you have to make the adjustment
[SPEAKER_05]: and elevate above it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that musicians have to now
start being innovative in terms of where
[SPEAKER_05]: they are and where they are situated and
where is their natural places to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to project globally too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of tools right now to
help that, but it has not become the norm,
[SPEAKER_05]: but with what is going on, we have to work
very fast to really, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: put a platform out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That also makes some money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, virtually interactive at the
same time, you know, and I feel that that
[SPEAKER_05]: is where, uh, people will have to push
themselves too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that regardless of whatever it is,
you're not limited by geography because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's becoming very hard to navigate across
borders and geography because people are
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming more divided around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we've seen, nations are looking more
inwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, everybody, you know,
even stop political stability is,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, becoming a big question around the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of these things impact the ability
of musicians to travel and be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: showcase their artistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are the mercy of all these elements
that we also need to now start seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: things that the innovation doesn't
necessarily come from other people doing
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to innovate how we still are going
to reach the people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, how many albums do you have?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have seven albums and one EP.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then, you know, get a new one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The new one, Voice of Bombo is the current
EP that's out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And branches of the same tree was
nominated for a Grammy for reggae album of
[SPEAKER_03]: the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, um, I think, um, either the
first or the second African to be
[SPEAKER_05]: nominated in that category.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also the first of my country,
uh, to be nominated for a Grammy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so that nomination for me was,
um, you know, I mean, people like to use
[SPEAKER_05]: the word historic, uh, for, for it,
but I also saw it as a combination of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, when you're evolving a new sound
was that the Afro root sound finally was
[SPEAKER_05]: able to grab the ears of people as to
what, um, innovation that that sound had
[SPEAKER_05]: brought to contemporary reggae music at
the same time to brought to contemporary
[SPEAKER_05]: high life and Afrobeat music.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what I did was fuse these two
sounds in a way that could be accessible
[SPEAKER_05]: and also could speak in a way that
everybody from every culture could access
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the Grammy nomination was
an eventual validation of the sound that I
[SPEAKER_05]: have constantly championed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, it is, um, you know, now every,
you know, all the Ghanaian, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, artists, everybody's striving to
win a Grammy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just like, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I lighted a big fire out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you say it's a big inspiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you didn't win that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a Morgan heritage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Morgan heritage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Won that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and congratulations for being the
first Ghanaian to be nominated for a
[SPEAKER_03]: Grammy, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And may you get a Grammy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: On your next album.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_03]: And in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also, you know, the thing is that
California is California is also a home
[SPEAKER_05]: for me, you know, apart from being in
Ghana, I've spent a lot of time here,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so, you know, I feel also like a
native of California, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: as they say, you know, you, sometimes you
recognize that you don't belong to one
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You belong to many places.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, this place for me to is a place
that I'm proud to call home to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we can get some gigs around here
before the rest of the world opens up and
[SPEAKER_03]: then yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
