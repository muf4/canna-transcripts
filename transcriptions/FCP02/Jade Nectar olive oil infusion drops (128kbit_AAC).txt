[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys are having a good weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just hanging out here with a nice big
bag of freshly dried and cured Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our favorite Thai strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some other people have reported that
they also appreciate the Thai strain when
[SPEAKER_00]: we use it in our tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got very good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where just today I'm going to start making
a new batch of our high potency Sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a thousand milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a lot of bang for your buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a thousand milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of eating gummies and all
these other edibles and such like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we feel at least that this is a really
good value too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keeping it really simple and in olive
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with tinctures, you're allowed to
go up to a thousand milligrams per bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is an efficient way and an
incredibly healthy way to consume your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and your high potency THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't just think this is a wellness
product that's not recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially this Thai strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, myself included, feel that it
has an extremely cartoony, clown-like,
[SPEAKER_00]: silly effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and you actually, when you're walking,
you actually, for some reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of makes you bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to actually concentrate on not
skipping when you walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that sounds fun, get ready and look
out for our new Thai strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also want to show you just the
quality of what goes into our tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, this is just pure trophy
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these could all get trimmed up if we
wanted to do trim flower sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we actually, right now, our niche is
doing tincture, the olive oil tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel that that's the healthiest and
best value way to consume your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, these are just some of the
flowers that are going to go into this
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture that I'm about to make actually
just in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This steel drum, this is actually empty
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where our olive oil comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this comes from an artisan olive oil
manufacturer or creator or farmer in Paso
[SPEAKER_00]: Robles, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually grows a ward-winning olive
oil, super high vibing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's such an incredible nerd and
purist about his olive oil that he
[SPEAKER_00]: actually designed these custom stainless
steel drums to store the olive oil to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it has as little oxidation as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these aren't even stored in plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's his own stainless steel drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he gives me the polyphenol counts
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is top notch, high end
artisan olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then all we do is we take these flowers
and we soak them in olive oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it in a big kettle type situation,
but it's all food equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just let the cannabis soak in olive
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is the olive oil is the
solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually just naturally absorbs all
the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every little bit that's in the trichomes
and in the plant matter just naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbs directly into the olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't use any chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use any solvents, alcohols,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just olive oil and pure whole flower
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have been doing that since
biblical times and before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's how Jade Nectar is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you more information later on,
but just because we have this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of Thai flowers right here,
just wanted to show them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great time and also let you know
that our Thai strain is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: featured in our next batch of sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after we do the Thai,
we're probably going to do an African
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, which we've got some mind
blowing African varieties, land race
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties this year too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have some really good
sativas, as well as our Indicas that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be all Afghan and Iranian Indicas
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, lots of good stuff,
but just know that this is how we make
[SPEAKER_00]: Jade Nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some day we'll do a trim flower
because this is primo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you guys have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
