[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast where we talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about cultivation journeys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today our guest is DK Warren of Sugarship
Cannabis Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find him at sugarship.co or on
instagram at dk.warren or his reddit
[SPEAKER_03]: account at u-slash-general-t-e-e-s-o-o all
one word.
[SPEAKER_03]: My co-host today is Cosmic of
CosmicStrains.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at Cosmic Strains Official on
Instagram and u-slash-cosmicstrains on
[SPEAKER_03]: reddit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm your host Nick Wolf or MrWolfGrowz
on both Instagram and reddit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just wanted to introduce DK here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is quite the amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: DK, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've been chatting on various
online forums and social medias for quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to finally meet you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as we kind of talked about before we
started the show, I've been a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of drank some meds and trying to
power through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, getting over the holiday hump
and kind of just trying to get back to
[SPEAKER_00]: things and plan my next rounds and hunts
and what's to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just about every run, I have like three
things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like just plants I know are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm running for personal smoke and to
gift to people and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that I keep rerunning and kind of my
staples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a few of those going off the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Kepler 22B, which is about to be
renamed, unfortunately, because somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else used that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gotten its way into the
commercial space here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't want to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be called Astrofruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the most bizarre smelling,
fruity, bubblegummy, medicine smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: plant ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kept it pretty close for a few years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm going to start letting
people have that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already given it to a few
commercial grows, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, every time I run it,
it's like shocking, super strong and keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: its terpenes really well in the jar,
like really, really awful smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that you hunted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took everything I make, I hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very seldom do I use any clones to do any
of my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started with a great pupil for mass
medical strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pupil V2 that I hunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really have a great taste,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't I kept the mother around for a
bit to do some breeding because it had
[SPEAKER_00]: some really special qualities,
but didn't really check every box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure in his seeds, there's other ones
that taste delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular one I had just didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I bred that to Capulator's Miracle
Grow, which is like he took I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like two thirds of what makes up Mac the
miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember all of it right now,
but any crops that to like an OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like a pre Mac kind of of the
same Mac stuff, but without the cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: and cross that to that to that great pupil
V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out with this like really
interesting, funky expressions of like
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegums and really cool flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foxed it meant natural fox tailing and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my coolest cuts that I'm
like finally going to let people get their
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't that was back when I was doing
like branch pollinations and like much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller seed runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like all of those are sold out and I
have like maybe 30 in a personal stash,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no way to buy those anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, the cut will get out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a sister kind of like a cousin to
that plant is my Black Canyon Kush that I
[SPEAKER_00]: always just about every run I run one of
those because I like to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that same great people to mom and
pollinate it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher vibe from key play or I think he
calls it seed business keys to the
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to test stuff for him and whenever
I would find something cool, I would breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another really cool plant crazy flavors
like berry cushy nose and like fun playful
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always a staple in my runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have that's like rerun my
critical level haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always run really hazy, but like grows
like a bush so you can grow it indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: only takes like 70 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep trying to find hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep running all these hazes and they're
like nightmare indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you have to like trigger them
before everything else and they outgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and they don't fit into your
water schedules and they don't fit into
[SPEAKER_00]: your tent heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I want to grow the classics and I
want to grow hazes and sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff and I keep trying, but it's like
so challenging indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I found that critical level haze,
it has like the classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spicy metallic smell in the grow and then
it tears into like an insensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hazy kind of nose and it's really good in
the high is super high flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always kind of run some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to go through all of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like a ton of no, no, I mean I was,
you know, it's just kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in what's going on in your
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sounds like you got a lot,
you know, in terms of how much you have
[SPEAKER_03]: like going on at any one given time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, one of the first
questions that I do like to ask is what
[SPEAKER_03]: got you into growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you introduced into growing like
vegetables or other plants as a young kid
[SPEAKER_03]: by a relative or like what was what were
some of the first plants that you ever
[SPEAKER_03]: grew, whether it be cannabis or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first ones I ever grew was every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to grow like giant sunflowers next
to my house with my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would have her little garden going
with like tomatoes and cucumbers and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason I became like the or
the sunflower guy and I would grow these
[SPEAKER_00]: like 12 foot sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really proud of how big they would
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when I was like really young,
but then in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: My town that I grew up in is like is known
for plant nurseries and like basically if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: A house or a development the land in my
hometown is used for nursery growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily like ornamental landscaping type
plants, not like not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: For food really there is not like Apple
Apple orchards and there are Apple
[SPEAKER_00]: orchards and grapes and strawberries and
stuff like that, but and vineyards,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the main all the hoop houses and like
the main like many, many hundreds of acre
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation is for like like rhododendrons
and arborvitae and various like the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you would buy at Home Depot or like a
plant outlet for your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every summer me and all my friends
would work at these plant nurseries and we
[SPEAKER_00]: would work in the.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the clone barns or the propagation
barns, we basically in the mornings we
[SPEAKER_00]: would go out to the mother fields and take
thousands and thousands of cuttings off
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was primarily tree hydrangeas,
so a lot of the work that I did was with
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning hydrangeas, so it would take the
cuttings that go back to the barn and
[SPEAKER_00]: spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 hours just making clones and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filling you know 5550.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 50 slot flats, just like
one after the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a conveyor belt with the soil that
filled the flats and we'd sit there and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the clones in a rooting hormone and
just plug them, plug them, plug them,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill a trailer with them, trailer them out
to the to the hoop houses and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like many medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you using to clone with?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just it must have just been a
potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know from it was like huge,
huge plastic wrapped bales of it that come
[SPEAKER_00]: in on like palletized delivery,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody would take like a forklift,
slit the slit the plastic, hold it over
[SPEAKER_00]: the hopper and just like dump it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A giant pallet of it must have just been
some kind of potting mix with perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, a 15 year old kid at
the time or whatever, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely soil, a soil medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just use the same cloning
medium that they use to up pot and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think there was any like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Differentiation between like the start or
the.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the next sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they went, so that was like years of
doing that, and then some of the years I I
[SPEAKER_00]: got into like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potted farm, so we had farms that like
would grow directly in the soil farms that
[SPEAKER_00]: would grow hoop houses and then farms that
would grow in containers and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: work when in containers is like adding
granular fertilizers and spacing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like in general maintenance and
and and growing these plants, getting them
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for delivery and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So driving around on a tractor all day
and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like bending over and moving plants
around most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it was tree hydrangeas,
but many other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of like where my interest
in cultivation and propagation began and
[SPEAKER_00]: where I started to like learn about this
stuff and see how it could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also basically where I got introduced
to cultivating cannabis too, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: would find cannabis plants growing in the
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the workers, the non high school
workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they would plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would stash a plant somewhere here or
there and we would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would occasionally stumble across it
and I'd stick it in my car and drive it
[SPEAKER_00]: home and hide it in the woods behind my
parents house and hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potted we would find potted ones actually
just like yeah, just like stashed in a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of like so like for sure not even
just like a dropped seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something is like for sure on purpose,
like because it wouldn't be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like in the interior kind of like
stashed away and we'd stumble across it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would be like alright, I'm going to
leave for lunch break today and run it
[SPEAKER_00]: back to my house and hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nothing you know it was probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican bag seed type stuff and just you
know plant what you got and hope for the
[SPEAKER_00]: best around.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: 01 OK, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was kind of my tinkering days
was high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know nothing like of substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be maybe like one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mature cola on these plants that you could
mess with or.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I had some plants that were like
looking really good and one one day I came
[SPEAKER_00]: home from work and they were uprooted and
laying on my back porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad had stumbled across him while he
was doing some yard work or something and
[SPEAKER_00]: just like grabbed it by the stem and
yanked it up and laid it on the back
[SPEAKER_00]: porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely had some trials and
tribulations with those early ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was all just like very low
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know going and trying to water things,
hoping you'd get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joint to smoke type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until college that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a hold of some good genetics and like
proper grow equipment and gruesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know some some good fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could tell that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my first indoor experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of explain that so I had some
friends in college that were growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: had been growing for a few years and
somehow it got a hold of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know California and Canadian genetics
and and you know train wreck was being
[SPEAKER_00]: grown and blueberry and that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of my.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends that was growing was a
web developer and he developed like a
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew the details of this,
like who this was, but he developed a
[SPEAKER_00]: website for a Canadian seed maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004 maybe 2005 and.
[SPEAKER_00]: The in exchange for developing at the guy
sent him a ton of seeds and so one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains was called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thor's hammer, which I know there's like
more than one of those today, so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's tied to any of the modern ones,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the strains was Thor's hammer
that I grew first indoor and the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: was called monkey snooze, which is bizarre
name, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the guy was going through some
problems with his.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going through divorce essentially
and they had they had a kid and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid that the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wife was going to like use that grow
against him in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like like whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the details, but he was just
nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he called me and he's like,
hey, I've got these plants that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to flip to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you come pick him up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I threw him in my car and took him
home, took his 400 watt HPS home and they
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of escorted me to the hydro store to
buy some buy some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is where I can get into like
how I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we we go to the hydro store and they
were like showing me all the Fox Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bottle nutrients and.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy at the store was like,
hey, this stuff, you know this stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: like the new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, yeah, you guys should give
this a shot if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a general hydroponics flora
Nova.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one part.
[SPEAKER_00]: For badge in one part for flower and it's
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like mostly partially organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like Syngan X people call it
now, but it's very thick like black tar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like not tar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like mud kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tried it and loved it and this is 20
something years ago and I've literally
[SPEAKER_00]: been using the same stuff for 20 something
years flora Nova.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called flora Nova grow and flora Nova
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add all kinds of other stuff with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can mix in your floralicious
plus and your whatever, but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: all you need to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go from seed to harvest with that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You went to the hydro store though,
got the got these new nutrients to go set
[SPEAKER_03]: up your first grow.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I get I get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Section off a piece of my closet with a
blanket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, like 400 watt super
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS in like a tiny closet with no proper
exhaust 2 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripping in a flower and then just like
proceeded to go like way, way,
[SPEAKER_00]: way down the rabbit hole of learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got on grass city forums and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just started posting and reading and like
just went way, way deep on everything you
[SPEAKER_00]: could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at one point I was like spraying
seltzer water on the plants because I read
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was like, you know, good for
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started messing with everything,
but those first 2 plants came out like
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal like the kids that I got him
from were like shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, you know, like I was
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go through this like big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stink it growing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I just kind of like got good
premium flower like the 1st time I
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested and then from there every run I
did like my next setup was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: larger than that, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just how many how many rounds did you
run that first set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think only one because we ended up
moving out of that house and I ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: moving out of that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: At town and had to give that guy's
equipment back and then went and got with
[SPEAKER_00]: some other folks with with more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically built like a closet or a attic
type of grow room for my next grow behind
[SPEAKER_00]: a false wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, like that was still,
you know, 20 something years ago or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I got a hold of larger grow
lights, you know, set up a separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg space flower space and dry curing
drying and curing space and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with space with like, OK,
I gotta track down some genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like back in those days you would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Print out an order form from a UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed bank hand write your order hand
totaled and send cash in an envelope and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know hope hope so like 4 weeks
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know some weird envelope arrives with
some seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, before that I got some through a
friend, so there's this like outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Athens, OH like OU is like Mix County and
that's where like some famous Ohio stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean famous to me because I'm from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be famous to a lot of
listeners, but like Ohio Dumpster and
[SPEAKER_00]: Death Star and Lemon G and all of that
stuff is from like the Columbus or Mix
[SPEAKER_00]: County kind of Athens area in Ohio and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew somebody tied into there and they
got me some New York City diesel seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from Meigs County growers and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew those and it was like incredible,
but it didn't yield like at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like right away I was like I this isn't
really what I'm looking for at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I was trying to like put out
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put out some more and that's when I went
to the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctor chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is he's still around today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That store still around today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The online shop and I ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Bang and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning Glory from Big Bang is greenhouse
seeds and Morning Glory is Barney's Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sell it anymore, but at the
time it was like three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years after Morning Glory had won the
Cannabis Cup, so I was like OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: this you know this is a good place to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I used to do my ordering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd look at like the Cannabis Cup winners
from like three.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eight years prior, the idea being like
OK, they won with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had however many cycles to like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know inbreed or BX this or you know
F2F3F4 so to stabilize these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was like OK, if they won five
years ago with it, then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good chance that that this is a
stronger or more stable badge,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I ended up not liking the Big Bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act that hunted a bunch of the Morning
Glory and found like an absolute killer
[SPEAKER_00]: and that became kind of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cycle after cycle, like
continuous harvest like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many, many plants of Morning Glory
for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so I mean, it sounds like you're just
like right onto the hunts of like looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for something that was that was like some
some awesome fucking smoke and something
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could, you know, move if you
will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it sounds like you were like pretty
on point early on and you said like you
[SPEAKER_03]: you went right from the little closet
setup where it was kind of like hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: my buddy needs me to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on a whim I'm going to just,
you know, jump at it and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: To I'm going to go set up a whole you know
attic grow and like what was guiding you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where were you getting the information to
set this up and like what were you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you using to sort of get you to
the like that level of success early on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess just like obviously I knew
propagation from growing up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I I learned propagation on like a
professional level and I learned large
[SPEAKER_00]: farming or scale farming like the way it's
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, outside of this new industry,
the way it should be done, I guess the way
[SPEAKER_00]: people people have been doing it for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of had that understanding of
like how things scale and how to like time
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I gave you the the the
shortened version of all of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was many.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was many times where things didn't
work or I had to try things and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, everything I read says I've got to
have moms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so got this space with these big moms
that are getting bark on him because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been around for 18 months and you
know they're just getting all old and
[SPEAKER_00]: gnarly and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized like I did a bunch of research
into, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift and cloning, cloning,
cloning over and over again and really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least for me and like a matter of a
couple years, you're talking like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning things over and over again,
maybe 20 times like I never saw any drift
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't not even the slightest like at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it like environmental impacts and
stuff can make things fade or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I eventually got rid of mothers and
just started, you know, cloning off of my
[SPEAKER_00]: next round before it went into flip and
using those cuttings like lower branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost it almost comes across as like
a healthier version of the plant over and
[SPEAKER_03]: over again, whereas like you can get this
buildup of viral stress or other,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, abiotic stressors where the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you keeping it around for 18 months,
like who knows what sort of stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: building up in the tissue there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with those with those plants,
you're vegging out to go flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all like brand new, you know,
vigorous, vigorous, like like awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: green, bright green, vigorous growth that
like it would all clone super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually used to clone back then
directly in cocoa like and had no issues
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I use plugs and all that stuff,
but back then it was just like dip it in
[SPEAKER_00]: some gel, put into cocoa and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so I mean, yeah, I gave you the
fast version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely went through a ton of like
trial and error and like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I said earlier, like way down
the rabbit hole on grass city forums and
[SPEAKER_00]: just like learning and I didn't really
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: People to talk to back then, you know you
didn't really talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see a lot of these podcasts
and most people say the same thing is like
[SPEAKER_00]: you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had your grow Bible books and maybe if
you got hold of some weird VHS that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody put out way back in the day,
some copy of a copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some stuff online, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean it was all forums back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it wasn't nearly as in the open
and posting pictures was even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you didn't really want to do
like I have almost no pictures from this
[SPEAKER_00]: time back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've won.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean that makes a lot of sense
because you know 20 plus years ago the
[SPEAKER_03]: level of illegality was almost at a
pinnacle where like people were going away
[SPEAKER_03]: for unheard of amounts of time and just
being cracked down on so heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I totally understand wanted
to just, you know, stick to stick to what
[SPEAKER_03]: was working right rather than having to
risk branching out and looking for someone
[SPEAKER_03]: who could teach you even just differently,
not necessarily better or anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with genetics, like I said,
once I found kind of the cut that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checked everything I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, oh, let's play with a
bunch of stuff like I occasionally threw
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get a bag seed of like I got a bag
seed of some Mendo perps and grew that and
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some crazy purple candy stuff for
awhile, but it wasn't as vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like a novelty and.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would occasionally test stuff,
but I had to have my like staple that was
[SPEAKER_00]: like OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that like you know the bulk of it
is going through this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one strain and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I did back then was
standardized like who it went to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that there was really only
like one person I was talking to and.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all left there and went to one person
and then I didn't care what happened after
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but like sure you know it was very.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tried to simplify it and and and you
know, make it as like rinse and repeat as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, had some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely had some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few scares for sure where I had to
like tear the whole thing apart and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up doing some you know some wild
stuff to try and save harvest and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know these these you hear these
classic stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of my harvest ended up in a.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a hunting blind drying actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was like we gotta get we gotta
get we gotta clean this all out of here
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it somewhere and it's like where
the hell do we take this and it's like I
[SPEAKER_00]: know the spot back in the woods like a
tree fort basically and it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's called stoner ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it's just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This something needs to happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what, but we need to figure
out something to do with this so.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was the right time of year,
cold and dry and winter or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that would be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I you know it made it to harvest it
kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 10 days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days early, so even though it was it
dried OK it it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had that look to it, you know for sure
you could tell it wasn't fully mature,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was your kind of early days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean with with all the like seeming
success that you found early on and not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily running into too many
roadblocks that would prevent you from
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to continue growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What what maybe were some of the the
setbacks that you might have faced where
[SPEAKER_03]: you you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it was part of your learning curve to
to like make you a better grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, um, all kinds of stuff man like
we were, you know, I was running.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like I said that was like I was
reading so much and so down the rabbit
[SPEAKER_00]: hole that I was trying everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I had water filtration
system hooked up to RODI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all the water had to go through
this tiny little RODI thing that took like
[SPEAKER_00]: forever to filter water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, you know, having to like
plan ahead and like filter and fill
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons and stuff like that, like way
ahead of feedings to like try and get
[SPEAKER_00]: water through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know nowadays it's like at least in
Colorado tap water is fine like you can pH
[SPEAKER_00]: tap water and it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect like you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't want to say perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's better way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some of these cultivation
facilities have million dollar filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better than my tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, back then like that,
I thought that's what you had to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like read online.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you had to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like none of my plants ever saw
straight tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either filtered through a
filtration system or bought at the grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was definitely like early days trying
to figure stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had I had a non sealed room with CO2
going, you know, like I had like like just
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking all of it directly out of exhaust
fans, you know, like that type of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: like calculating, you know, square footage
and trying to get to like twelve hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM of CO2 and do, you know, swapping
tanks out every couple of weeks and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it all perfect and not realizing that I'm
just like exhausting all of this extra CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: directly out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with like I had, you know,
it was an air cooled or whatever like an
[SPEAKER_00]: exhausted thousand watt and that was going
into a carbon scrubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also had some like bathroom type
exhaust fans on the ceiling, just pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: air directly out of there with no carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, it's like, why does this
whole block smell so strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have the carbon filter to
going like what the hell is going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this must just be a rank strain and
it's beating the scrubbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like now, like looking back on
some of that stuff, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell are we thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a sulfur burner going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually see much of that these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I bet it's used at most some of the
larger facilities, but you pour like
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered granular sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to work, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had any issues in that grow with
like any molds or I mean, I guess like
[SPEAKER_00]: very rarely like a tiny bit of bud rot or
something, but like no real PM or molds or
[SPEAKER_00]: issues like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those early days, I also had zero pest
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that was like the,
you know, not taking like now everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: swap stuff and like half the times you get
pests, it's probably from your hydro store
[SPEAKER_00]: or from your medium that you're buying at
your hydro store or a clone that you
[SPEAKER_00]: bought from somebody like if you just keep
to yourself, I think that stuff kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just stays away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really had to deal with like none of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard Colorado doesn't have like the
worst pest presser either just due to,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not a lot of bugs that can
overwinter up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry and hot and arid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the times like the only thing
I was really dealing with here is fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those I learned were pretty much just
like coming from the medium that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I switched mediums and I have no issues
with that anymore either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's, what sort of substrate are you
using with the, what was it, the
[SPEAKER_03]: fluoromax?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use 70 30 cocoa perlite from a
local manufacturer here, Growers Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give it to me for free though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't even be plugging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should, now they should give it to me
for free or something, but no,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using like Tupper before Royal
Gold's product and I'm almost positive
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where my bugs were coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard a lot from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I don't want to put them on blast or
sound like I'm talking smack because I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the product, but they can come on and
defend themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like I use that for so long and
I like it and it was great, but I was
[SPEAKER_00]: always dealing with fungus gnats and then
I would get rid of them and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and I was like, what the hell's
going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned it to the grow store guys
and they were like, we've had dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, switch away from that
and got rid of their bug problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did it and it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk shit, but you know,
whatever seems like what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of my stuff is pretty like,
dude, I'm like the, I don't have like
[SPEAKER_00]: wizardry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like the lamest how I grow ever,
but it allows me- Run through your,
[SPEAKER_03]: run through your like, just like run
through your grow setup as you run it
[SPEAKER_03]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use Clonax gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use those plugs, riot, riot plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I've added in the last year
is probably the Clonax solution for like
[SPEAKER_00]: young plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will stand behind that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works fantastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like those young plants,
you're kind of like afraid to give them
[SPEAKER_00]: anything potent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're like, ah, they're,
they hit that period where they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, they need something,
but they need something mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I give them something too much,
it's going to burn them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I don't give them enough,
they're going to start to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and yellow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that Clonax solution is like perfect
for that early stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I repot from there
into, it depends if I'm doing seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing clones, I know right away
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing seeds, it might go into solo
cups so that I can, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I pop like three or four times the
seeds I intend to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I call plants like every single
step of the way, like any mutations or
[SPEAKER_00]: irregularities or slow growth or anything
like that, they get killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you pop them in root riots?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I paper towel, paper towel in like
plastic food containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right into a solo cup or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper towel until they have tails,
which like, you know, standard 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: 72 hours and then solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like I said, I kind of just
start calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start calling right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start calling out of the paper towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh, that one's got a bigger tail
than that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that one's fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's scrawny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess I have that luxury because
I make seeds and I have so many extra that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even when I buy and I'm hunting other
people's, I always pop way more than I
[SPEAKER_00]: intend to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people would say that's
ridiculous because I could be killing off
[SPEAKER_00]: a unicorn and not knowing it, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vigor is so huge though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you pop all the seeds in a pack?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you save one seed like some people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what my goal is for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm like really hot on something,
I'll buy more, you know, I'll buy like a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pack or, or even if it's my own
that I'm testing that I'm like really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about, I'll pop more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's something that's like,
you know, known to be a pretty stable pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds that somebody has been selling
for like years and kind of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures online look really similar and
breeder write ups, grow reports all look
[SPEAKER_00]: really similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might only need like three fems to get
a really strong plant out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's the case though with
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have a lot to answer your question
more directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a lot of like one seed pack
sitting in my fridge that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah, I popped all but one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe other maybe that's a thing we
all do and don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I just talked about it in an
episode I recorded recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was basically talking about like,
you know, the philosophy behind it is like
[SPEAKER_03]: you're saving that one seed because what
if it is the unicorn?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if that's the philosophy,
though, then why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be popping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for a bunch the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that I was like, I have all
these like single seeds laying here and
[SPEAKER_01]: but anything around to it and you have to
do those single seed runs like it's it
[SPEAKER_01]: almost feels wrong unless you're doing you
know, a batch of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually funny enough, if you go way
back on my Instagram timeline,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a hunt that was 50 something strains
or one each 50 something strains one each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like just like who will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like before I started breeding
a lot more or a lot more breeding focused,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, some won't germinate and
some will stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I one of the websites I think Attitude
Seed Bank does like a mix and match where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can literally just like choose one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just choose like chose like 40 different
ones and then took single seeds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: like other stuff I had and did this huge
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I don't think there was any
like unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some good plants, but I had like
nothing where I was like, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping this forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel like that's got to be there's
got to be some sort of statistical
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis that can go like if you take 50
seeds of one strain and hunt it versus 50
[SPEAKER_03]: single seeds of a bunch of different
strains and hunt it like it are used more
[SPEAKER_03]: statistically guaranteed to get a better
cross or like a better representation of a
[SPEAKER_03]: nice flower from the 50 of all one or,
you know, the 50 of individuals like my
[SPEAKER_03]: vote is some statistician that's like,
oh, it's absolutely this or that I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a funny question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my vote would be the 50 of one
strain, which which I say which I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like totally counter to how I
hunt and stuff like that because I'm such
[SPEAKER_00]: a nut for like seeing new stuff and like
finding new stuff that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my hunts are between one and six phenos,
you know, like many more seeds to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: like many, many more seeds to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the actual finishing flower might
only be like one to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six different phenos that actually like
made it through all those culling stages
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, like I do want to like and I've
tried to talk to some of the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation spaces about like getting a
bench of theirs or like in their in their
[SPEAKER_00]: testing rooms getting 50 out there or 100
or, you know, like of some of the lines
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm like, you know, I've maybe
lightly tested them and I'm like confident
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's craziness in there,
you know, some of them that have done it,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them locally I know of and some of
them in other states have like bought
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple packs of the same the same strain
off of me to like do a bigger hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never hear back from those people like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they do it because they're
because it wasn't a good experience or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people just kind of like, you know,
like not everybody is like us posting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything online and doing write ups on
everything they test and getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are like, wow,
this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they never really feed that back
to to the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish I got more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have the ability to have the
ability to write reviews on my website and
[SPEAKER_00]: like don't get many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish more people would come back
and like talk about their experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could definitely empathize with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's sometimes I'll give
advice out to people and I just won't even
[SPEAKER_03]: hear back from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be like, oh, you know,
I really hope that that worked for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it didn't, you know, let me know as
well, because I can adjust.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you want to have that stuff,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I need to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need the bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even need the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just to feed the ego.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not feed the ego a little bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I I see a lot of the flower
pictures that you post on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_03]: Reddit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like when it's the representation of
one of your strains that you're putting
[SPEAKER_03]: out there, either for the first time or
just showing a really nice representation
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm curious, do you have a specific
grow method for your plants that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering out specifically for like
glamour shots?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you just running seed plants in
your pheno hunts, selecting them and
[SPEAKER_03]: choosing those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a little bit of both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything goes through the exact same
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my seed plants will photograph really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I grow the seed plants the exact same
feed schedules, the exact same treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes better, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I it shifted over the last couple
of years to where like I value my seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plants more than I value my jar plants or
my my smoke plants, I because other people
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting my seeds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like literally like say if I was in a
hurry or had to go somewhere, and could
[SPEAKER_00]: only water, you know, half of my plants,
I would water the seed ones like and not
[SPEAKER_00]: the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I misexplained what I was what I
was asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so like when I say seed plant,
I should have clarified because,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, as a breeder, you're thinking
of a plant that's been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like so if you're growing a plant
from seed, are you flowering that out for
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant for the shots that you take for
Instagram?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you taking a cloning of it and
flowering the clone out?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do, regardless of if it's from
seed or from clone, what's your method for
[SPEAKER_03]: growing that out to get like those really
robustly beautiful plants where you have
[SPEAKER_03]: like all the colors are really deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trichomes are really pronounced.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole plant has a really, really nice
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're very there's a lot of
turgor to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're all rigid and upright
and not necessarily like big old floppy,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, candy strains sometimes I feel
like are like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, like what's what are you doing
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is kind of the same answer,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is grown like identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I so my the if it's something new that I'm
talking about, like if you see me posting
[SPEAKER_00]: about a plan over and over again,
I'm like, oh, I'm excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a like hunt like this round of my
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hunting my black lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lavender haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those pictures are from,
you know, I took a I typically when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is, you know,
my packs are sold as twelve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give people fifteen, so they have a
couple extra in case one doesn't germ or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll start with fifteen and,
you know, with most of my seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: regular or all up into this point are
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're half and half male female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get seven or eight females.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I'm calling the week the
whole way down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those pictures that you see are like
recently I've been posting those black
[SPEAKER_00]: lavenders like those are just from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time I've ever seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are seeing them, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bud shots are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the way I grow from from from seed,
I do have others from clone, as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, some of my like mother shelf
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder shelf that are going right now
and try to get those like really nice bud
[SPEAKER_00]: shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the trick is like day 50,
55.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you get that like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peak, you might not get peak colors yet,
but you'll get like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of like nice fluff before
anything starts to like deteriorate or
[SPEAKER_00]: crinkle up or kind of get an uglier look
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times the best photo or the
best little look is not the day of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some some plants just stay looking
beautiful, as you guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it's just like that earlier
photo will be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't do anything like no
tricks, no weird feedings, no like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I'm hunting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all being treated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I guess the trick is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will never see or hear about the
losers, and I'm not talking about my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a loser in my own seeds,
it'll be able to get pulled from the
[SPEAKER_00]: website and I just refund everybody or
replace it with something else like I.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I release my new seeds untested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I germination test them, but other than
that, for like a discounted price and then
[SPEAKER_00]: when I internally test all of them,
I put the price up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I internally tested that and it didn't
make it, I would pull it off my website
[SPEAKER_00]: and just reach out to anybody who bought
it and be like, hey, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess what I'm saying is like when
I'm testing others like right now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: running a bubble gum or a bubble yum
bubble yum.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a resin seeds and.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like extremely average plant,
so the only time people heard about it on
[SPEAKER_00]: my post is like when I post like hey,
this is what this hunt includes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know in the beginning is what I'm
doing this time and then I just never
[SPEAKER_00]: really post it because it didn't show up
or it just didn't become something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noteworthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like yeah, there's a lot of stuff that
just never makes it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To nice pretty photos because it just gets
one and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you grow it and onto the next one
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you like when you're doing these 15
seed hunts just to do like the testing of
[SPEAKER_03]: the pack?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you cloning them right away before you
put the seed plants into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got a little bit of a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tip there or a trick that I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I every single plant that I ever flower
gets cloned gets backed up like no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what I have a pretty strong rule about
that these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know you guys know why I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you, you know that one and I got
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got that story and eventually
you're just like I need to back up
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that becomes room, you know room
problems, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you back up everything and then you
have no room for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like becomes crowded and packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I started doing is and like I got
some people were I posted about this
[SPEAKER_00]: online year ago or maybe more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were like that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people were like I could see that
causing problems wobble bottom like it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do is I clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: For preservation cuts at like day 9 of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has already started to trigger into
flower so it'll root right like it'll root
[SPEAKER_00]: just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll root it up and it'll root and grow
like maybe one or two more nodes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll mutate out like a.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I not monster crop or like a yeah
like a it started to revenge revenge
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the word I was struggling
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll it'll start to throw single
blades and do the whole revenge funky
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation thing and then I'll go back into
normal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with that, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saved a week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I waited till day 9 or I saved a
week and two days and then you know 1014
[SPEAKER_00]: days of cloning whatever you want to call
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already in the week 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the revenge slows things that you
guys know it slows things down a ton when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're reveging things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant goes into this like really
slow mutated growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that takes like two weeks for the
plant to come out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're on to like week 5-6 of the the
the hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still small and you've still only
got this like 10 inch thing and by week 6
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting to know what you need to
keep, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're kind of like, OK, like you
kind of know your winners at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least you might not know your your
winner winners, but you know your losers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you know there's like you're like
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some B branches and even though
it might be good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to cultivate something that's
so floppy, right?
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've got a 1014 inch plant at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you already know what you're calling,
so that's my pro tip on on preserving
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunch of people in the comments were like
that's going to be caused problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't that that may be the most
practical use of monster cropping I've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fully honest, like because of like
space restraints and then like you even
[SPEAKER_03]: have the potential of you get that top
that sort of like can mutate from the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower node where you get a bunch of new
nodes that grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you you're still keeping a stout
plant with lots of tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that if it is nice and you want to
clone it and even like send out clones to
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know, you're you're right
there at the end of flower ready to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's I mean, that's really efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an efficient way to Fino Hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, it's yeah, I mean, I'm not going to
run out and get a plan to show you right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but I have some that are right at
like my run right now is at like day 58 or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did have to top the preservation
cuts or whatever we want to call them the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they're only like, you know,
14 inches high or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in one and a half gallon pots or
they're not taking up much space at all at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but now a lot of like the time what
I'll do now is the ones I want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take a cutting off of that one that
went through that process and start a
[SPEAKER_00]: proper mom from like the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's my like that's a pro tip
because everybody reached out to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, I can't clone everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I keep everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you have room for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, maybe I do have more room
than most, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I have like five tents or
something like that or five different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you feel like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any other unique approaches to
cultivation that maybe not a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: people are using or that like that you can
find maybe just a select few are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this isn't unique, but it's an
answer to your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't train anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I used to train and and be like way
into like doing all kinds of crazy bonsai
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or even using like I found these
like trellises that like are for tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: cage, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like a flat top and you can put
it in your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like two feet up, three feet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can like kind of have like
potted trellises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't do like full trellis like
everybody does because I'm moving stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: around so frequently because of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I need potted plants that I can like
pick up and carry to other places and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pollinate and then bring back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't do like beds or I can't do
like an individual trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've done is like when the
seedlings are young and even clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mostly speaking about seedling,
once they get to like the fourth ish node,
[SPEAKER_00]: I start removing all the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've noticed is that the plant
will naturally get bushier because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: light access to the lower nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even without topping at that point,
you already start to get this like
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerated growth on the lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my system for every seedling is like,
yeah, fourth node, I start to remove all
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger fans and then by like the six
or seven or eighth node, I will,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the way the plant,
individual plant is growing, I will,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I will actually top and then I'll
wait, you know, a week or two and then
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found like, dude, the time people
are wasting with all these crazy tie out
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and all these crazy like,
they're not gaining anything because like
[SPEAKER_00]: your footprint of your light and your
space didn't change, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if I can fill that space by doing
that with like a single topping and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of, excuse me, like,
you know, allowing light into the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: areas by removing certain leaves,
it's faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, I'm still taking up the
same square footage of that plant's canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: that you did with all that training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying like there's obviously
places and grow techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to grow with like Scrogs and like
I've done all of this stuff and I love to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it because it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I found like a lot of that just
slows you down and doesn't increase yields
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of anything else like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I water way less frequently than most
growers with my technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hand water and it's only like every
three or four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people always think they're like,
holy shit, my cocoa dries out in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a matter of pot sizing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just if you didn't size your pot
properly, then you're going to be drying
[SPEAKER_00]: out constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I finish in five gallons and there's
the plants are sized appropriately that
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't need to water for like three
or four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do water, it's like a total
flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a like flood, the medium 20,
25, 30 percent drain it drains off and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of carry some of the waste or the use
the spent nutrients with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get any type of like salt
buildups and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what what sort of EC are you feeding
at?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the last I think I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't test any of that because I've been
doing it for so long with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I used to have all of this in my grow
chart feed charts and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say I never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did calculate anything back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I made these charts 21 years ago and
haven't looked at them since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did it by EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it by PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was like eleven hundred
max, twelve hundred max.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sound right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been like a really long time since I
looked into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really couldn't tell you is is the
the flora Nova.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like a powder that you just dissolve
in water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like a liquid?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's a liquid, but it's thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you have to like shake it really
aggressively.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much are you adding per gallon?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one and a half teaspoons,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's like super concentrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's pretty crazy to have
something just so so simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you like adjusting the pH or
anything with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I pH before I put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pH afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing I've been doing the same
thing for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I pH my my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's literally all that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you pH your water to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Water to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pH the water to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that I don't go above certain
amounts with that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water or the pH remains in that
like low sixes kind of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's like no magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no like it's like the most I've
been in the hydro store before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like new growers have been in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sales guys were like, just talk to
him because they were already going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell these new growers on flora Nova.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, just ask him how he
does it, because like it's the lamest,
[SPEAKER_00]: most basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's funny when you guys asked me to
come on and do this, like how we grow
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, I immediately thought like the
actual how I grow in terms of like product
[SPEAKER_00]: wise is the most boring, simple thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for a new grower, dude, that's so good
for new growers, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So awesome to hear that they can pH their
water to 6.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's just plain water, you can get
a cheap pH meter because it's it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: salts that you need a nicer pH meter where
the like the crystal isn't getting messed
[SPEAKER_03]: up and like the different components that
actually measure the water aren't getting
[SPEAKER_03]: messed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's plain water and you're just
pHing that and then just drop it in,
[SPEAKER_03]: stir it up, pour it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's probably one of the easiest
ways I've I've heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with how your flowers look and the
people who listen to this, I know that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's going to be some of them that
already see your stuff online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they don't know that this is how you
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just going to go, oh,
my God, what am I doing with my life?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is I feel like it because to simplify
people's grows at home is one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest gifts for most home growers,
because so many people spend like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, an hour or more a day in their
grow just to make sure that it's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, if I can get in and out in
five minutes, I'm I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some drawbacks for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you cannot drip the stuff that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it would clog your clog your drippers
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't so it's it's hand watering,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most new growers have a couple potted
plants, you know, keeping it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, like I said, you've really got to
shake the stuff because it's like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got grit in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it settles and for sure you've got to
shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I use the little
measurement shot glass to pour the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use droppers or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to like kind of pour it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some like drawbacks and
like it's so potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you accidentally overdid it,
like you could burn your plants probably
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that issue because I just
measure everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I try to tell new growers all the
time that this is what you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see people with like like DWC
first time and stuff, and it's like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get crazy yields if you succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you mess up phing one time or if
you mess your EC up one time for our
[SPEAKER_00]: window, you scorched your entire like your
whole harvest and then you get all sad
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do you not use any calcium or
magnesium supplements to help compensate
[SPEAKER_03]: for the cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, none.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've like messed with it in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've I've messed with tons of stuff in
like over, you know, 20 something years of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've messed with like all these products
that they recommend at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I just end up going back to
the simple it's too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I could probably be getting bigger
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that I'm missing out on much
on like the flavor side, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like the expression side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably something I'm missing out
on the, you know, pumping it up side and
[SPEAKER_00]: like bulking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not really my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can get it to fully express like,
you know, terpenes and trichomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors, that's I would much prefer that
overtly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a larger yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really trying to pump it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as a breeder to have quality as
the goal, I totally understand that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not necessarily about, you know,
you're not looking to minimize pot size so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can increase planting density so
that you can increase yield per square
[SPEAKER_03]: foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're you're looking to get the nicest
buds you can out of each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, on that note, I try to do
that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to increase plant count so I could
hunt more, you know, like as a phenol
[SPEAKER_00]: hunter tester breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like one gallon out, you know,
like thirty six, fifty plants in a five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five or four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like just, you know,
you cut everything off and you've got one
[SPEAKER_00]: cola and that's what you're testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's your proof or whatever for that
phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that demonstrates the
plant at all to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried doing that for a while and I
was running these like many, many smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you don't really get to see
that plant come to maturity at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't get to see its branch
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to see the inner node
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get to see the inner node
spacing on the top five nodes of that one
[SPEAKER_00]: cola that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you have no idea how the lowers
branch out if it crowns up really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if like the branches at the beginning have
eight inch nodes and then they shrink down
[SPEAKER_00]: as you get towards the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you never get to like see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went right back to like nothing
smaller than five gallons to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to see the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's usually like chest high or
head high and five gallons and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: properly grown, fully mature plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're missing it if you don't do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've also said, you know,
you you're not only breeding for home
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, but you're breeding to get into
the cultivation space in some cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: But who is your your biggest customer,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is is is home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation spaces just want the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want the cut like they they
don't want to hunt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have had conversations with a lot of
them and I've shared cuts with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I'm not big on like
making a zillion dollars off of one cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just usually give it to them as
long as they keep my name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I have a cut of your
flawless lavender that I'm going to try
[SPEAKER_03]: and get into a in a cultivation space and
get into mass production just with your
[SPEAKER_03]: name attached to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think we will pheno hunt maybe
once or twice a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like maybe like I think the last
time we did a pheno hunt was outdoors this
[SPEAKER_03]: last year, but it was kind of last minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get anything from it other than
the flower that we sent off for
[SPEAKER_03]: processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like, you know, it's really
hard to justify.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of our earlier podcasts,
we were even talking about how pheno
[SPEAKER_03]: hunting at a commercial level is so
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's it's kind of crazy to think
about it and then how a home grower can,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, get one pack, pop it,
find something great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they keep it, then they can get
that out to a lot more people really
[SPEAKER_03]: easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so what I was going to say,
though, is how you're growing in the five
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon pot where there are a lot of home
growers growing in around that size pot,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it it does cut down on the
maintenance required of either having like
[SPEAKER_03]: an irrigation system or having the ability
to water multiple times a day by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see how that's a really good way to
also show the expression of what someone
[SPEAKER_03]: might be able to experience at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with such a simple growing method,
too, it just it shows how how easy it
[SPEAKER_03]: really can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really I'm like blown away by that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I try to keep it as simple as
possible, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I do a two parts for veg and two
parts for bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those parts is shared between
the two because it's just calcium nitrate
[SPEAKER_03]: and calcium chloride mixed together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so but the other two parts are just
all the other macros and micros.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you can you can keep it so
simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then adding all this other stuff just
seems to complicate things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the traditional G.H.
line?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using a J.R.
[SPEAKER_03]: crop tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that when you like buy your own
calcium nitrate and calcium chloride and
[SPEAKER_03]: they just provide the flower bag and hedge
bag and you just mix up your concentrates
[SPEAKER_03]: and go to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been toying with changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've tried it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that I shouldn't even mention
this because I can't think of the name
[SPEAKER_00]: right now that I've been organics alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about trying that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not plugging them because I've
never tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like through researching it and stuff,
it seems like they've got an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: thing going over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought about trying that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anything that I see working at a
commercial level where I see people
[SPEAKER_03]: actually producing nice flour at a
commercial level, I think that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's there's a huge thing to
say about at least the cost factor of
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to produce nice flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at scale, you you're not going to
find a lot of people with a 16,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a 16 part mix anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's not tenable with the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what what I do certainly doesn't
go to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to use the product I use
hand or without hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be you might be able to mix up
like huge vats of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it'd be it's not ideal for that
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a bunch of different like strainers
and shit all the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably pulling stuff out that
you're getting into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I'd say most of the
people that reach out are our home growers
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe like caregiver size, you know,
like small, smaller from I have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bunch of different facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, they usually want cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have bought some of them have
bought packs and hunted packs and like
[SPEAKER_00]: like I've had ones here in Denver that
were like starting a grow and the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically were like, excuse me,
for for this first run, we're dedicating
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the tables to the hunting and like
to kick off the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to do a giant hunt and then
we have our own phenos that nobody else
[SPEAKER_00]: has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That story ends poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like had a falling out as people seem
to do in this industry and like lost all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cuts and they're starting over and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually reached they actually
reached out to me because one of the packs
[SPEAKER_00]: that they hunted was the first Kepler 22B
that I put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out the F1s and then I put out F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both in pretty small numbers and they're
all gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they hunted it and they were
like this was like there were like six
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenos that were like
everybody's favorite, various favorites in
[SPEAKER_00]: here out of everything we hunted,
all from that one pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, we lost them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's, you know, like that that
that's F1 breeding, though, with those
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like he was like, yeah, we have some
that smell like bubble gum and some that
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some that like they had a variety,
you know, like that's that's one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to make sure to talk about,
like on the podcast was like what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and what it what it what what
people should expect out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the podcast is not necessarily
about my breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's most mostly about how I mean,
let's let's say you go ahead and choose
[SPEAKER_03]: like what's what's like your what's your
focal point in breeding right now and and
[SPEAKER_03]: what are you trying to to get out to
people through your breeding practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the whole thing for me started a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got back to Colorado and wanted to get
into the commercial space, wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase a commercial facility and start
growing at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the market's been horrible here,
like the pound price is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are giving away spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, OK, well, what can I do in
the meantime until there's a better market
[SPEAKER_00]: or until the time is right to enter?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started, you know, I started phenol
hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, screw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to test everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gathered up every clone in town,
ran everything, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy smokes, I don't like any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I had taken a few years off
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came back to it a few,
you know, four years ago, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, all this stuff is so hyped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is what everybody's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tried it and I was like,
oof, like so much of it, just like so much
[SPEAKER_00]: of the hype these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really beautiful when you grow
it and then like you cure it and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor's gone or the highest flats or it's
just like commercial, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a good flowering and bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, it like lost that magic of like
the 20 years ago stuff that I started
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So none of the older stuff that you
started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in cedar clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've been through too many,
like I've moved around a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like have for sure have never
been able to like maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have some pretty old seeds,
but nothing noteworthy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in my head, I was like expecting
all that stuff, you know, like expecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that like, you know,
you open the jar and the whole house
[SPEAKER_00]: stinks or the whole car, whatever the
whole area is like ruined from like
[SPEAKER_00]: opening one jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that often anymore at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of like, OK, so I ran
through all these clones and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, I got to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to seeds so I can find something
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started growing all these like,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not no shade on anybody, but like a
lot of these like, you know, US and
[SPEAKER_00]: California and like these popular breeders
I was finding on Instagram and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've been out of this for a
while, so I didn't know who was who or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 2020 or so that you're getting
back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got back to Colorado and got back
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like back in the day, it was just,
you know, greenhouse and barnies and Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, there were like all
the UK and Amsterdam and like those were
[SPEAKER_00]: all the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as I get back and I kind of start
looking around and there's all these like
[SPEAKER_00]: new ones and it's all so hyped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started spending a lot of money on a
lot of these seeds and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started I'm not going to name any names,
but it just started becoming this like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, aggressive mutations and like
herm issues and like like crazy like this
[SPEAKER_00]: one is like barely yielding anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was just like, what the hell is
going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is and it wasn't across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I grew some stuff that was
fantastic from US popular breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I kind of was like, screw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started ordering seeds again from from
the UK and and from Amsterdam and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: went back like hoping maybe they still
have some of those old lines that I loved
[SPEAKER_00]: from way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and and some locals here,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so the first breeding project I ever
did was a local breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Colorado Seed Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is now or while they still exist,
but split off this dude, Sam up in Boulder
[SPEAKER_00]: is free world genetics project he worked
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it Hibiscus Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from like some Hawaiian sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I got long story short,
I got a male in the seeds that was like I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, this is a monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just was like outgrowing everything and
super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back on it now that I know a
little bit more than I know about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, it probably wasn't the best male
ever because like a lot of times plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that put a lot of effort into like fiber
production or like hemp production like
[SPEAKER_00]: stock production aren't necessarily like
putting that that effort that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: be putting into flower is going into like,
you know, building the frame or building
[SPEAKER_00]: like fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back, it might not have been
the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time I was like blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up being a good project for some
and not for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I bred that to a batch of like nine
plants and tested one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't test well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, damn, it's breeding things
harder than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I didn't release my first one
first one that I thought I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I can't put my name on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tested the next one and it was
that Hibiscus Sunrise male pollinated to
[SPEAKER_00]: dosy does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's a super cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on my site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Island Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first one that I ever put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you get these like 17 inch
spears and they're like crazy rusted
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got this really pungent like
tropical fruit nose to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows like it's a super strong
aggressive grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have trouble like keeping
up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a lot of feedback that people are
like, man, it's failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like day 40 because I like can't keep up
with this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a little bit tricky or more
challenging to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a super cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of kicked off the whole and
the rest is history.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, like that was the first time I
made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was just like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I really like this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what if what would it be like if I
combine it with this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just went from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the first two years or so of
breeding was just a lot of like things I
[SPEAKER_00]: like combined to other things I like,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be cooler if it combines
with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is not always yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have projects where I'm like,
I combine two things and it came out fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the result, but it wasn't better than
the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, what's I'm not going to
sell these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go like I combined calculators,
goat gas with some other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't throw the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, they're in my fridge or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, I don't want to sell
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, just go to a calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goat gas is better than this thing I
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't like make something new and
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lot of the beginning was
just like trying to like see if two things
[SPEAKER_00]: combined to make something better than the
originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you follow me, if you've been
following me for like the last two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a lavender plant that like
completely took over my like it's like I
[SPEAKER_00]: found like the the thing that I'm like,
OK, like this is truly unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It checks almost every box as a mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the plant I have that I do all the
breeding with does everything perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: except it veggies a little bit slow and
it's growth patterns are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: irregular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't get this like uniform crown
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, man, it yields well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dripping with these like floral
beautiful terpenes, like not spicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers, I don't even have you gotten it
tested before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got it tested and I need to do it
again because I got it tested and they
[SPEAKER_00]: like messed up the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they like called me and I'm
like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to be like a 48 hour
turnaround.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were like we had to send it
to our other lab, our machines broken and
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it eventually came back and it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results came back with like nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing interesting, really like like a
very like run of the mill terpene report,
[SPEAKER_00]: like where I was like expecting something,
you know, like there's some magic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smelled anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that I give it to nobody's ever
smelled anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even like other lavenders that I
smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the report came back and it was
like not telling of any kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to like run another batch and
get it tested by another lab because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really trust there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of messed with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But and did you find that lavender in a
pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought a this was totally by
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never even heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I heard of lavender because I knew
so much story and I knew like he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: legend and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was really excited to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let is it laughing Buddha?
[SPEAKER_00]: By Soma or on a Buddhist sister by Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had I had sampled that here in a
dispensary many years ago and loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's always been one of those bucket
list strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how like you have them sitting in
the back of your head that you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really one day I'm going to grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found it in a multipack from an
online retailer in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a Soma like anniversary
multipack or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came with like seven different
strains, you know, like his amnesia haze
[SPEAKER_00]: and so Gouda and so mango and say amnesia
amnesia is lavender was in there and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other things and my CD and some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no knowledge of lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know it was popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know people cared about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got this Soma multipack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to hunt and all these people
started commenting and messaging me like
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender, lavender, lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I never I was like, sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the probably would have cost a
couple hundred bucks to get the same
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I I didn't know what to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Buddhist Buddhist sister,
Buddhist sister didn't come out good at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was OK, but it was nothing special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the two lavenders that I finished
one was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lavender, like musk kind of
smell like musky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up keeping that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender one and got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is lavender three that I do on my
breeding with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know how to accomplish that
without like letting that cut go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like catch 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I want you all to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't want anybody to have this
because it's the only secret sauce that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's like my, you know, most special
feno that I hold until you find something
[SPEAKER_03]: that beats it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you'll you'll be such a it won't be
your baby anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to come close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of it's some of the seeds that
it's making are coming close to me being
[SPEAKER_00]: like, OK, I'm comfortable letting that out
now because I'm seeing expressions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that are either better or close
enough or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the one plant I've been posting about
lately, the black lavender is like it it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dug up some genetics from the great
pupil because it's a black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cross my black hand and push which has
great people in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of had that color, that pinkish
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen some of my
videos online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've posted like the hues and stuff come
from that, but it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender terpene like it's like almost
identical, like a slight, maybe slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeter, but like almost identical to the
mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have this like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful pink purple red plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only the only thing it's missing on
it's got a better structure, better growth
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns, doesn't require any support like
all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe it's not quite yielding as much
as the as the the main lab that I use for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but if you follow me like and look on
my website, you're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, everything is got lavender in the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I started a I released chapter
one and chapter two of my lavender
[SPEAKER_00]: project, and I'm about to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released chapter three in a two months
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started saying to myself like this is
something I haven't seen in other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally different like this cut that
I have, and I've hunted many other
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender seeds too and haven't found this
like I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hunting lavender right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally in this hunt I have two more
from directly from soma seeds and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like so I don't know if that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anniversary pack that I bought was some
like vintage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know when he released
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably message him and ask him
when it was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was from a different parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find more of those multi packs
online at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find anymore and but but so now
I'm buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another new pack I just got of his
recent lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep thinking to myself like OK,
I'll keep you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's something close to this or
similar to this and more of these seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and I found nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I started crossing it to
everything and and and trying to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bring those flavors to people and it's
been working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get messages all the time that
are like this didn't even smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it smells like you know flowers or
soap or perfume or you know, like floral
[SPEAKER_00]: incense kind of which some people
absolutely hate by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people that reach out to me and are
like what you're doing sucks and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid and I hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate it and I'm like, yeah, well,
you know, like at least I'm not doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As everybody else is because it seems that
like most people are doing the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, buy a hype cut and
reverse it to a bunch of other hype cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know because I I'm not sure
if it's the same lavender, but I always
[SPEAKER_03]: remember back in like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 2008 910 at some of the dispensaries
in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was lavender and it was coming down
from Mad Farmer up in Mendo and I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: sure if it's the same lavender because
then he had a bunch of lavender crosses
[SPEAKER_03]: that were like pretty pretty well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: People reach out to me all the time about
this and I've researched a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other breeders that have worked with it
and stuff and I think that that era you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about is when most people know of
it from like the 2010 ish range.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will be like, oh, I haven't seen it
since 2011 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there was a minute where it
was around from what I've gathered through
[SPEAKER_00]: my research that lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was spicier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was spicy for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mine's not at all like and I have
lavenders literally right now growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: are spicy and floral and I like get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like mentholated like
yeah, this is not in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems completely unrelated to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would always compare it to like Mendo
folks because we'd say that it like had a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of that like that purple flavor like
yeah, whether or not that's even a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like just like the methyl
anthranolate of the grapes or the
[SPEAKER_03]: anthocyanins or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just like came through as this like
very distinctive flavoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like a very spicy floral but
with that heavy purple tinge to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is like its own thing and I'm
not just trying to like sell it or sound
[SPEAKER_00]: cool or whatever, but it's like it tastes
like it smells and it makes the room smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like it smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's extremely pungent when you're
growing it like like most florals kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like wouldn't take over a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd expect like a cam or a
diesel or a, you know, train wreck to take
[SPEAKER_00]: over a room smell wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this floral can like take over and
dominate other smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a unique experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so different than everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: With it being that loud, it makes me think
of something like a really good Jack
[SPEAKER_03]: Herrera or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then just where it's like really floral
but just also like, you know, really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really loud in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're going to smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I've grown Jack a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't mean can't attest to like
if it was the Jack or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've grown a Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown Jack seeds before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's not I don't know what to
compare it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I yeah, like I've given I've given
samples to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given samples to my stepdad who who
smokes because he has MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom absolutely hates the smell of
of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she hates the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's always spraying the room down and
opening the windows and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she calls me the one day and she's
like, she's like, don't tell Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that that lavender stuff that you sent
him, I love the smell of like the burnt
[SPEAKER_00]: smell of it in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she she was like, don't tell him
because like I don't want him smoking in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it's it's that different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't remind you of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it's actually got a lot of the
line a little in it and and it's being
[SPEAKER_03]: burnt, then like I think of like the,
you know, the bundled lavender or even
[SPEAKER_03]: like sage bundles that people will light
on fire and burn and in specific ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, like to there's probably some
nostalgia there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the smell is so, you know,
that like carpet powder you can sprinkle
[SPEAKER_00]: out and then vacuum up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had I think so, like you had like
like like Arm and Hammer, like baking
[SPEAKER_00]: powder and they flavor it or sent it,
you know, and then you vacuum it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole room smells good and your carpet
smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had if you had like a floral one of
those, that's kind of what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say it smells like like like
floral incense, but and it kind of does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's like a totally different
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the first breeding project I did
with it, I outcrossed it to Max Stomper,
[SPEAKER_00]: which took a while to find a good Max
Stomper breeder because that line has
[SPEAKER_00]: really it's not a great I don't want to
say it's not a great line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like not a strong line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are finicky, but the flower at
the end is like really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like not strong plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I finally found like a strong male and
made a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released a handful of things from that
mail, but one of them was Flawless
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender, which became like probably my
best selling or one of my best selling
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of wish I wouldn't have named
it that I named it that at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was so obsessed with this damn
plant that I found that when I made that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, I named it Flawless Lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wait, I don't even I
haven't even tested these yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if these are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like now I've tested them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I attached this name
Flawless to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was hoping that I didn't like to
make a come out looking like an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so anyways, that Flawless I hunted
through a ton of and found a male that
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled exactly like the lavender that I
like that that was the mom to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had the same kind of leaf
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a better frame to it, like a little
better build.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I pollinated all of
chapter one with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing, like everything I'm
finding in that and people are reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: back are getting very strong lavender
expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost as if I used a lavender male,
which was the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it wasn't a pure lavender,
but I tried to find like the most lavender
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could out of that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I BX that to the lavender and the
expressions that are coming out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: are like very, very, very much like my
like my main one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the other ones I did in
that line, you know, they're F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have variety, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're going to have variety across
the book from, you know, from both sides
[SPEAKER_00]: of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there seems to be pretty dominant
floral and lavender in those plants coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second the second chapter was
with Caramello, which is a different
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders version of lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's all lavender lavender as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now for chapter three,
I reversed I reversed the the main plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's successfully reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first time ever, I'm going to be
releasing feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have Lavender S1 Lavender times
Violetta, which is a seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a PCK times purple Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did use some other outside cuts
for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally I'll throw one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like last year, the year before last
year, I think at the seed event in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was chatting with Capuletor and he had a
jar of pine soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a body's what Goji Oji Fino that
he found that smells just like the pine
[SPEAKER_00]: soul cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, holy shit,
I would love to cross that to my lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Capuletor sent me that cut and I
pollinated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the dispensaries here in
town has like a golden goat cut that they
[SPEAKER_00]: use for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just made like he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, he shares cuts with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share cuts with him, but he just made a
new version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it to like cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he calls it golden cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zombie Kush, I hunted some zombie Kush
from ripper seeds and pollinated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got five crosses this round that are
all coming out as stems from the main
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they've got like two more weeks to
finish the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got some some really cool
stuff coming down for people, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: some fems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I'm going to move on to a few more
questions here, kind of as we get to the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get back to real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no worries, Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, man, it's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, General, really awesome to
finally get to talk to you and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wolf, you know, great seeing you and
I'll get you around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, take it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later, Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, since you've had a little
bit of interaction with both the
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial space and then a lot of
interaction with home growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: what would you like to see sort of change
as the next few years roll on when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to the cannabis community or
industry as a whole?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I think there's a lot of us like
that are have gray in our beard that are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like missing the the loud from
back in the day for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's the like aggressive
inbreeding and the push to hide high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: contents has like something's been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the plant can only put so
much effort into one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're like reading for high THC and
breeding and not just high THC like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the the main goal of most of that
large scale mainstream breeding has been
[SPEAKER_00]: high yields and high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we want good, good mass and and
and high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like and then and then people are
buying things based off of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they they find a, you know,
that works for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it has the purple hues that yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's got a high to get you super
cross-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then they market the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody is like, oh my God,
I need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I need the the purple candy gas,
the Gary Payton or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking shit on Gary Payton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if I've ever smoked very
good before, but I just pulled out a room
[SPEAKER_03]: of Gary Payton and it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's probably like the wrong one to
pick because that's probably like really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all, you know, it depends on
who's growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you get like one of those like
runs, let's say out to where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's, you know, I don't know,
maybe a hundred different facilities in
[SPEAKER_03]: each legal state growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it, you know, it just saturates the
market and then you get something that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: bad example of it and turns you off to the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like the those strains from the
early 2000s into the 2010s and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, like stuff had to get
popular because it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like everyone asked for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, OK, like, like every two
weeks you get a new bag and it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's whatever's come through the pipeline,
you know, like and then eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: something hits and the whole state is
asking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the whole area that got that bad or
that batch is like, where is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is more of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get more of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what drove what was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like, oh, wait, there's a huge
demand for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I can move all of it instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a higher price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you I've seen a bunch of the
podcast, you hear Gabby and them and other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that were in the New York area
during the diesel days talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just became like if you had it,
you could make one wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can move as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name whatever number you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how that's how things were
chosen back in the day was like it had to
[SPEAKER_00]: win against everything else that was put
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's winning through marketing and
being marketed because it does well in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff, the stuff that's the best in
your joints is not the stuff that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same stuff that's going to do best in
the commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, like you can sometimes you
can hit it just right where you get all
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you get all of that,
check all the commercial boxes and you
[SPEAKER_00]: still get an enjoyable experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there are some, of course,
like like, let's say 10 percent of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars on the market are are having to
have that potential in them, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have to then rotate,
you know, through a bunch more strains
[SPEAKER_03]: just because of the demand and making sure
that the shelves are filled with a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and if you want to have enough of a
market share, you got to have,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you know, four or five things on
deck at any given time just to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that you meet that buyer's demands because
they have to fill that slot of whether it
[SPEAKER_03]: be candy or green or Jack or floral.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's it's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think like that's one thing I would
love to see change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I don't think it's going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a lot of stock in that
shift happening because the way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that the market is structured now
doesn't really allow for the customer to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're like, I'm not trying to talk
like they don't know, like the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't know what they're they're
misdirected for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We marketed to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, OK, like this thing,
I've seen it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard everybody talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, maybe you have heard
everybody talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen a lot of marketing related to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been buzzed about because of all
this marketing and people spent a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money to get that strain name in your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you think you want it because it's
been everybody talks about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, there was a lot of
work that went into getting everybody to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason that that that's the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was just like back to based on
good is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like the best wins out because that's
what people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like in a mature market,
you know, we might see this end up like
[SPEAKER_00]: like beer, you know, with the craft
brewers and stuff like it might get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to write like like once there's
national legalization and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have your micros and your macros and
people are going to get to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be able to say like,
OK, I want the biggest bag I can get for
[SPEAKER_00]: one hundred dollars or I want the best bag
I can get for one hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how much weight it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always kind of been one of the
latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been like I I will pay for the
top shelf or I will go out of my way to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the top shelf low yielding plant
because it's special and interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of people that
that want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your market, how healthy that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have it here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just decided to flower out something
that I'm going to need to veg for almost
[SPEAKER_03]: twice the time that it's going to take for
everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sacrificing a huge veg space just
because I'm like it is the most beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking expression of runs or a candy that
I've seen in some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a from blockhead buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his Pave runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a Pave runs cut that he had crossed to
his blueberry sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like this frosted out tight
nugs spiral, you know, perfect little yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: stacked on each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just it ripens all uniformly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know his blueberry sugar well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that plant, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: John here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmer John here in Denver grows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pave, that would come from from
compound Chris, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compound put out all the Pave stuff
originally, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's just a cut that he has
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might even be a collab between the two
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly am so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't keep up with all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much of a focus more on like the
cultivation aspect of things where like
[SPEAKER_03]: even that's almost impossible to keep up
with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so much going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives so much variety people can choose
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't like something like I
don't understand all the animosity I see
[SPEAKER_00]: online, people talk and smack about
breeders or growers or cuts or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much anger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there's we have more variety
than we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 20 years ago, like I said,
I had to fill out a form and send it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail and hope for the best now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you if you don't like what
somebody is doing, just like go somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much variety now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like spoiled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with what you were saying where
you're like you miss certain certain
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties, it's it's almost like you had
less to choose from, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like when something was good,
it was just gravitated towards or heavily,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it might have even been
marketing of the time just because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like you were saying,
only the good stuff really survived what
[SPEAKER_03]: the what the people what the market would
bear, basically, like what people would be
[SPEAKER_03]: buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, the good stuff,
the cream rose to the top, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a much smaller cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cup overfloweth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're like, you know, you're
running around from this hype to the next
[SPEAKER_03]: hype and hope and to find something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, it's still out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even sometimes, depending on,
you know, if if you want more variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's possibly even more variety now
than there was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you got to sort through a lot of a lot
of phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think and I commented on one of Gabby's
posts a while ago that I think it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of that era of like like people are
like, oh, what's the next big thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there is a next big thing
like there's so much now that like how
[SPEAKER_00]: does one thing become the next big thing
like like Mac was one of the last big
[SPEAKER_00]: things, I think, in my opinion,
like there's there's just so much there
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different like for one
thing to rise above every, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like, OK, 10, 10, 12, whatever
years ago, Gorilla Glue hit the market and
[SPEAKER_00]: was like on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, OK, Gorilla Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you need Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares about anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, since that through the
teens, there's been a bunch that have are
[SPEAKER_00]: not a bunch, but there's been a handful
like Mac and a few that have like become
[SPEAKER_00]: the next big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nowadays, like what like like,
yeah, there's popular stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, like Gary Payton or runs or
this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like those none of those seem to be at
the top of the mountain, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I can't I can't say that any one of
those is like the thing to have right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you got to have lemon cherry
gelato if you're in a commercial market or
[SPEAKER_03]: at least some form of like that extreme
purple candy gas, which is just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it gets tedious to say over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, even like where we're at at
the commercial spot here in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we've tried this, you know,
we've tried to go that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've gone for like extreme
bag appeal, but with some unique turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gone for, you know, extremely potent
smoke that, you know, may not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: be the best looking, but it's just really,
really tasty and really potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it always just comes back to like,
you got to like meet them in the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: and find the nicest version of runs or
candy that you can grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, for a minute there a couple
of years ago, it might have been GMO or it
[SPEAKER_00]: might have been wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those might have been like the top of the
pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like today, I don't know that I could
name a strain that I mean, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: close with lemon cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's probably one of the ones I see
the most hype about and see pop up the
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I never have people come in or in
conversation saying like, where do I get
[SPEAKER_00]: the lemon cherry gelato or I need it or
anything like like it's just popular
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's commercially popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like being drooled over by
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think maybe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just totally out of touch because
I'm I'm so far from your typical consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: because I cultivate, you know,
like I'm not really in the in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That it does give you like that one step
removed where like I just went into a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispenser yesterday and I got some
concentrates and I was looking through
[SPEAKER_03]: what the strain names were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I don't know half of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I I'm almost sure that some of this
came from stuff that I've grown that ended
[SPEAKER_03]: up into a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of these are the names that I
sent it out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go I'll go like every other month,
I'll go to this one store in Denver that
[SPEAKER_00]: has like an insane amount of deli style
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just sit in there for an hour
and bother the bud tender and make them
[SPEAKER_00]: show you every jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do it just to kind of like make sure
I'm not missing something, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically, like make sure that like
there's not something out there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, I need to be working with this
or like this is this is new or this is
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, every other job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all like relabeled stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just sit there and go runs runs
runs gelato, gelato, gelato, like every,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it's it's like every every
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just bringing bringing those
varieties and like getting getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: more actual variety instead of like stated
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people act like things are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, is it though like is
it is it's it's dessert chunky purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, purple candy gas or it's
dessert or it's it may be just this like
[SPEAKER_00]: slight note difference than all this other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I go to these like I go to the
flower competitions here in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the one at the hydro store had
like seventy five, seventy six different
[SPEAKER_00]: jars and like, you know, no hate to
individual growers or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifty of those were indistinguishable from
one another, you know, and then twenty,
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty of them are have unique notes and
looks to them and then I don't know if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: at the right numbers and then eight of
them or six of them were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, like that's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a great example of what they
grew or just something so unique and so
[SPEAKER_03]: out of left field that it was like,
oh, man, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, I think you need both to stand
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need a different unique that's
also grown, you know, to its full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the philosophy of like doing like
in food.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do like the rule of two and one
where you do two things that are familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: and one thing that's unique or different
and something that's like novel to the
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, I like to stick with
like really frosty, really purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then if I get some weird like old
funky, you know, socks or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I like I love really I love really good
GMO that's like really purple and really
[SPEAKER_03]: frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then that just like pure funky gas
like that to me is like it just it hits
[SPEAKER_03]: your senses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Differently than what you're used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, it's like sweet and
candies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like excitement almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will say just like for anybody
that watches this, it is considering
[SPEAKER_00]: getting anything from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most of my stuff is in the more
beautiful flavors or more like like not
[SPEAKER_00]: much of my stuff is in the like rotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't gravitate towards that stuff much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few things like my DK Stomper has
like a skunky gorilla glue to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of like a nastier,
not nastier, but it's like a funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: funky smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really gravitate towards like
the rotting fruit or the stinky gin bag or
[SPEAKER_00]: like the farts or like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like it's just personal preference,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like the way I I don't look at
those plants and go like, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to always have this, you know,
like they're they're just not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garlicky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really my my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like I like sweets and berries
and florals and like delicious kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like smells that make you just want to
keep opening it and smelling it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we each have our own like
things that we kind of gravitate towards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as breeders to like you just kind of
lean in towards what you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And otherwise, you're not going to have
like the exact same sort of drive to want
[SPEAKER_03]: to make it as as great as you can,
because you're doing it for yourself in
[SPEAKER_03]: the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if other people like it, then like get
on board because I'm trying to make what I
[SPEAKER_03]: like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's that's like the maybe my
main point that I'd like people to take
[SPEAKER_00]: anything away from this is that it's like
I'm literally like doing what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not at all looking at the market and
thinking like what's going to sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: best or what's going to like be the most
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so much of that out there
that people can go get seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they want to get seeds from me,
it's like very much me choosing things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it people are not going to
like at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of it's like that's not what
it's for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the whole journey started
with me trying to find genetics because I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get into like larger scale
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wasn't finding what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I'm just going to start
hunting and making things I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the whole literally the whole thing
is is for me, I don't I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's how the best stuff's
got to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to like fulfill somebody
else's interests or like the markets with
[SPEAKER_00]: the market once or what you think the
market once like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that just takes like the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, puppy, that just takes like the the I
don't want to sound snobby and say like
[SPEAKER_00]: art out of it, but that just takes like
the creativity out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's like it's not personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not mine or whatever, whoever
whatever breeders doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, they're just trying to make
a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, they're not trying to like create
something that they like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I fully agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like as a breeder, then, you know,
since you get seeds to probably new
[SPEAKER_03]: growers all the time, what are some of
like either the pitfalls are or what
[SPEAKER_03]: advice would you give to new growers just
considering how often it is that new
[SPEAKER_03]: growers are growing seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting question.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: New growers, if you're talking strictly
genetically and like what to purchase,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the seeds to get for a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a good bit of research and and make
sure that like you choose something that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as a new girl, let's take it more
around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go more the route of like like
growing for for for new growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: like advice that you would give them in in
the in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say they already have some seeds of
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, like like advice to actually like
succeed with my seeds or like or to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in general as a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, a lot of my feedback is like
so the technique that I use, we already
[SPEAKER_00]: went through earlier in the podcast about
like the actual product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I use that is such a focus of
everybody and a discussion point of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, what do you grow with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your blah, blah, blah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your frequency?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so much more important than I'm like
the that the feel side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a bad advice because it's like
to grow well for new growers, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're doing is like my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it's like if you if you grow
simple like the way I do, like one part
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, cocoa fiber potted or it
doesn't have to be my way, but like some
[SPEAKER_00]: very, you know, not a lot of bottles,
not a lot of products of a pretty like
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and simple way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to spend time paying
attention to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to spend time like reading
and researching and like maybe chatting
[SPEAKER_00]: with people online or taking a photo of
something that you're curious about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this leaf is curling or why is my
plant droopy or like an end?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not like caught up in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 different bottles and a drop of this
and four drops of this and 10 drops of
[SPEAKER_00]: this and and then your feed chart every
other day has different cycles and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: chasing this like crop steering and you
get caught up in all of that and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like missing the actual like paying
attention to the plant and like being
[SPEAKER_00]: like, OK, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like like I should keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll it frees up your your energy
and your attention to like to like pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention and like, OK, what is actually
occurring here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also this like.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think things happen way faster when
they're new than they do, like people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people keep over adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Internet's telling me I need to give
it more nitrogen or Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says Cal Mag is like the joke on
Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so OK, I gave it to Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like, well, nobody in those
comments unfortunately told you give it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag and then wait 72 hours or
something, you know, like like so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like this this people will adjust
and then they'll adjust more and then and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they just end up like spiraling into
this like disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like one of the big things
that I always encourage new growers to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is like so once you've built so say say
you've got your selected nutrients in your
[SPEAKER_00]: medium and you know through research that
your your nutrients works with your medium
[SPEAKER_00]: and like you know that that's two things
that are working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either use the company's feed chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reduce it by like 20 percent is my
recommendation, maybe even 25 percent like
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever their levels are like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, give it 50 milliliters of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give it like 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get you to use more
products so that you have to buy more
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they basically they're feeding
feed charts and stuff typically recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: things that like the high range of
nominal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've got your nominal window
somewhere in the middle is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere down here is like as low as you
would want to go realistically and
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere up here is as high as nominal as
you would ever want to go without killing
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants or hurting your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feed schedules from the manufacturers
are going to be pretty high because they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to sell product and use product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always tell people like dial that
back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start for your first grow with that
manufacturer's table.
[SPEAKER_00]: At like a lesser volume or lesser lesser
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run through it and see what happened,
you know, and then maybe make adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: to your chart from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like if you start to see things go
wrong, you ever see people online,
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments are always like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, flush it, flush it out and then do
this like they tell people to like flush
[SPEAKER_00]: their pots with water to like flush things
out completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terrible advice in my opinion,
at least cocoa wise, like because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are no nutrients in that soil or in that
medium whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people say proper watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You return to nominal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you return to your charts like you go
back to what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my recommendation is if something's
going wrong like that, make up maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly larger batch than you normally
would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have more runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've kind of like you run off
whatever is imbalances in that in that
[SPEAKER_00]: medium in your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that runoff runs all the way
through, you've kind of reset to your
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have issues and you're in cocoa,
you might be able to do it with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a soil pro, a potted soil pro,
but like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cocoa, I see these recommendations that
are like, oh dude, you burned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to flush it out and it's like,
well, you went over and now you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go under immediately and the plane is
going to start starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's those are some points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's, that's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are, those are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, you know, keeping it simple and
then also not over-correcting when you do
[SPEAKER_03]: see a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like our huge things for like most
new growers and experienced growers as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, like the over-correcting thing I see
all the time, even in commercial spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but like the, the keeping it as
simple as possible in the case of home
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, it does free your time up to pay
more attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even in like a larger scale,
like let's say you're running a small
[SPEAKER_03]: little home grow for a profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, it helps to keep it simple because
you, you can free your time up for other
[SPEAKER_03]: things like security or for, um,
you know, pest prevention or, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: trimming, uh, manicuring, you know,
all these other things that are just hyper
[SPEAKER_03]: time consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you don't want to, you don't want to
increase the difficulty of the simplest
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For like commercial and for home growers,
like you, if you're new to it or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get better at it, obviously read
and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so much information out
there, but make sure you're reading the
[SPEAKER_00]: right sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much trash out there now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's good and bad now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, like define, I mean, everybody in
the industry likes to say the word SOP,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not that I disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How standard are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's like, it's just funny to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people like to say it or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it gives them some kind of a,
it sounds smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it in my day to day and my regular
work all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, so anyways, like you need to
like, do that research, learn a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then determine what is nominal,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for what is nominal for temperature,
what is nominal for humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in my grow, what is nominal
for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like your, your, and then the
rest of it's just execution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always just trying to get back
to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've already done the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already done the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at that point, what,
where you're trying to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like, there's like the
knowledge of what am I supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like the execution of
actually like achieving that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then teaching people not to panic when
they're within tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why like, I keep using the
term nominal cause that's like a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like best in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a tolerance thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, you're like, what is that
typically used in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, uh, I have a background in like
electrical and electrical engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll say like nominal voltages or
like, you know, like, like your outlets in
[SPEAKER_00]: your house are like one 20 volt,
but they're, I think nominal is like plus
[SPEAKER_00]: or minus 4% or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, okay, appliances that you plug in
might actually be 117 volts, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: system is designed to work within a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the term is used in other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like medical probably uses it
and stuff, but I, I take it personally
[SPEAKER_00]: from the electrical world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, yeah, it's like, you've got,
yeah, you've got a window, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got high low and then ideal or
close to ideal right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, work study and like come up
with those numbers and you, you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, that's right because you
did all the work to come up with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't have to second guess
your plan at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like trying to get back to that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just always trying to like achieve
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a simple thing, but it's,
it gets overly complicated very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many tools now though,
that help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back in the day, we didn't have these
home home, uh, home girls didn't have the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tools really that to, to do cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now AC infinity coming out with all
this, like little tent controllers and you
[SPEAKER_03]: just set your use that with the AI one,
you can just tell it what you wanted that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just does it exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got probably the previous version and
you literally back to the term nominal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you literally set high temp, low temp,
and it'll just cycle the fan to keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: in that, in that back in the day,
we didn't have all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, commercial grows dead,
not, not cannabis grows, but like
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial farming has sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those automation controllers were so
expensive and you needed to be like a
[SPEAKER_03]: engineering technician to be able to even
handle the UI and, and make sure that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was running properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a whole old industrial
controls and stuff like PLCs and
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial controls used to be like,
you had to go get training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to work on the thing, you know,
just to program the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all getting so clever and so
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow instructions and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we weren't even like back in the
day, we weren't even talking about like
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that what we always used
to talk about was if it's comfortable for
[SPEAKER_00]: you in the room, it's comfortable for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still go by that and I, that's how I
teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I teach my cultivators is I,
if they like go into a room, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's uncomfortable, then like you need
to realize the plants are probably feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: that too, cause we're pretty darn close to
what our comfortability level is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can handle a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transpiration, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, so I have a few like kind of
last minute wrap up questions that are
[SPEAKER_03]: like the ubiquitous podcast questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, I just feel as though it's always
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what's your favorite strain of all
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your, uh, your desert Island strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could get, one thing I, it's so hard
to answer one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody asks this on the podcasts
and it's, it can be a seed line or it can
[SPEAKER_03]: be a single cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's make it a little easier on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people talk about like,
okay, if you give me these seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could make anything from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, but as a breeder,
I mean, you have that prerogative,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that jumps out at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a unicorn that I'm chasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is that like 2003, 2004 blueberry
is like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a DJ short blueberry or it was,
I mean it was, who knows at that time you
[SPEAKER_00]: got a bag and somebody told you it was
blueberry and you're like, you open it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just like, it smelled like a pack of
like fresh blueberries picked on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like these silvery blue,
light purple, fluffy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very crystal coated fluffy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would kill for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the blueberry muffins,
number four, uh, from, uh, from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know there was a, I didn't know
there was a number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know there was like a cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number four cut is it's like pure
blueberry, like artificial blueberry,
[SPEAKER_03]: but with like a, a Crete, like a,
uh, like a pastry sort of a baked good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, essence to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally found a Fino in a hunt that like
kind of reminds me of what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about because the old one did not have any
pastry or bread or cupcake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying that that's not a good cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a good cut, but like this
old one was just fresh fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like just ripe blueberries and it
wasn't blueberry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't blueberry cupcake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the fruit and it was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so like relaxing, but not a
knockout, you know, just like that
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety, but still go about your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that original when blueberry,
I mean, I'm sure you look at the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry was supposedly around like way,
way before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the old heads might have
different stories than me, but like early
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands was when I was getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when a handful of people I know and
have talked to were getting it and man,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just like super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that stuff that you were like,
I'll pay whatever I need to pay to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've hunted a bunch of clone or that's
not hunting, but I've run a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that were like said to be blueberry
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them came close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so I switched to seeds and I was
like, all right, DJ Short used to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, OK, I'm buying Dutch
Passion seeds because they have the real
[SPEAKER_00]: cut because they work with DJ and ran on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like one was this gigantic
sativa herming all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one was like, it just looked like
these seeds weren't even in the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even look like they came from
the same batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so burned out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some DJ Short ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody I talked to is like not
finding the turps in the DJ Short seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, like either using different cuts
or it's just faded or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I bought some from double seeds in
Spain that claimed to have used the real
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phenos all were slow vegging,
you know, small stout plants like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the legend of that plant is said to
be like like kind of slow and ugly and
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I have one that I kept and I still
keep that I've done a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released a cut or I released a cross of
it in my last release called Blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like caramel times this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't check a lot of boxes because
it's slow as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't post photos of it because it's
kind of ugly, although it's about to hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice point where I might finally post a
photo of this damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure that I have what I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's the closest thing I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like even when you crack a leaf,
you know, and smell it like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like very sweet, fresh fruit
berry blueberry smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still not quite sure the search is
over for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's my desert island strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, yeah, to have that much
effort to then put into trying to find it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand why you'd want to
definitely have that one back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody listens to this and and somehow
has that because everybody that says they
[SPEAKER_00]: have that cut, I haven't been impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my circle is small, so it's probably
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I don't know the right people,
but for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it's blueberries big and
like the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe maybe someone out here here and
think of you be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next seeds back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read with it and send them some seeds
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next question is what's your who's
your favorite breeder of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like so before I ever even grew
his stuff, I always I like kind of revered
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the legend of Salmo was always
like kind of super cool to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even like I said, way back in the
day, I never even like cultivated his
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every time I was like shopping on the
banks, I was always like, oh, it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like he's onto something and he sounds so
interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've grown them out now and I've
had some success and some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not success, but I did find a lavender
that I've kind of gone nuts over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I'd have to say probably him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely like.
[SPEAKER_00]: For better or worse, this kind of like
doesn't say much good about me because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a new breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm kind of more I kind of give
more clout to the old guys than the new
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, even if you like strike gold like you
mentioned, you know, who is a black head
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier with his blackberry and super
booth and the blueberry sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's putting out like super cool stuff and
like the names, his names, obviously going
[SPEAKER_00]: around and, you know, huge kudos to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that's it's still just kind of
like the OGs from Amsterdam and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, different parts of Europe and
Dutch seeds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a lot of those guys names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know them personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the brands and stuff, but I'd say
that's where I like where I lean towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still keep going to those seeds and
to those companies over there and Spain
[SPEAKER_00]: and the UK and and Amsterdam and stuff and
keep running those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep finding like really loud stuff,
like really interesting, loud stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be I see people online like
talking smack about Dutch genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, that's where most of
this all came from like way back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where most of this breeding
originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's always California goes way
back to I'm not trying to take anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: take anything out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a there's a level of
professionalism to Dutch breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: though, that wasn't really seen elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a lot of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding Cali and a lot of those cuts that
got popular in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day were like some bad seed or
some had some weird story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, train rack was found in a train
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like some bizarre story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like or, you know, all the
legends of diesel and stuff, although it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like some of those, you know,
the real stories have come out now and and
[SPEAKER_00]: chems and all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of it came from like one bag
seed, because back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's like we didn't have access to
huge genetic libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, like you said, the Dutch had pro
programmatic breeding back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were sifting through like shitty
plants for generations and generations to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out with these things that could be
F1 hybrids and totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like like not much naturally
occurring stuff you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw in your closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's very few, maybe some of
the Afghan stuff you can just throw in
[SPEAKER_00]: your closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of work and a lot of
generational breeding and selective
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding went into like making that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Dutch did a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of those og breeders are
where I kind of like have the most
[SPEAKER_03]: reverence for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will be the last question of the
little short questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your most or what is your most
memorable cannabis related experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've seen you ask this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have been prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell maybe I'll tell my first time
story and tell them instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's that's because I didn't
touch on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can just be because it's usually
one of the most memorable experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I was just hanging out
with a bunch of friends and they had all
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was probably, you know,
Mexican brick back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just remember like I couldn't figure
out the carb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they like packed a ball for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I'm doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like arguing with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, no, they eventually
had to like hold the lighter for me and
[SPEAKER_00]: just say like, you know, inhale or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember kind of like sitting there
in a chair in my buddy's basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell if I was like talking
myself into feeling something or if I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually felt something, you know,
like in my head, I was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my feet are tingling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, but are that like are
my feet tingling or am I just sitting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: chair like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first time was pretty like I was
definitely a square, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I didn't like pick up a bong and take
a big rip and know what I was doing or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like a total like square trying to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next time somebody gave me
like a small bag of some Mexican brick and
[SPEAKER_00]: me and a buddy went out in his car and
like drove drove around the block and
[SPEAKER_00]: parked and like made a tin foil bowl and
like just hot boxed his car with tin foil
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mexican bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting there, we were probably we were
probably listening to the police or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to do as a big fan of the
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and just like I think that time that
second time was the first time for for
[SPEAKER_00]: better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tin foil and swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like really high, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, eyes squinting and
like definitely giggling and experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wish you know what I wish I did
remember, because this is probably would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the first time the first time I
had like kind, but you know, like back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, the good stuff, it usually didn't
have a strain name attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind, but when you got
something really good and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one strain in particular coming
up that it was called Beauty and the Beast
[SPEAKER_00]: and whoever was doing it was very,
very good at cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this was very loud, very potent,
very expensive, you know, and only came
[SPEAKER_00]: around every few months like now that I
grow, I know harvest cycles and I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: know why it was coming around every couple
of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had a little quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you had to know the person,
you know, you had to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know who Beauty and the
like you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Seed Finder, but I don't even know
if that's the real Beauty and the Beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it says it's like a C ninety nine
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't look like it yielded well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like golf balls, you know,
and like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, it was like it was like an event
every time you could get your hands on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good story for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably what I should have
answered with to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that that strain was called
morning glory that I had kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: cycled through a lot of for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up and I'm like from Cleveland
originally could see it on my hat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I eventually made its way into the
hands of some rappers, some local rappers
[SPEAKER_00]: in Cleveland and not that I wasn't
connected to them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like totally secondhand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got like one day I got like a
voicemail on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on vacation in Baltimore or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to voicemail and it's two people
rapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of knew who I kind of had an idea
who it was, but I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like kind of freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like rapping about the morning
glory and stuff and about the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, paranoid grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like deleted the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eventually like talked to the guy that
knew them and I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why did I get a random rapping
voicemail on my phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that it was Kid Cudi and
a Cleveland or an Ohio rapper called Chip
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrapped together a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I'm sure you've heard of Kid
Cudi or any show up there, but we're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same age and from the same town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they eventually got a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they still to this day, Kid Cudi and
Chip the Ripper, when they collaborate or
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll hear them yell it on songs,
sometimes on intros, they'll say Almighty
[SPEAKER_00]: Glorious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They named when they collaborate,
they named their collaboration Almighty
[SPEAKER_00]: Glorious after morning glory, the strain
that I was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like literally you were growing
that they were smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only as yeah, it was my stuff
that they got a hold of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was morning glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they must have been I can only
imagine they must have been having a
[SPEAKER_00]: session smoking and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, ask the dude that
brought it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said morning glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, we are the Almighty
Glorious or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it all came to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally, they Kid Cudi his album
from last year, like him and Chip are like
[SPEAKER_00]: yelling about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Chip a couple couple months ago and
talked to him about it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told the exact same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, OK, that's kind of an
interesting like weed story.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think when you told them
you're the guy that grew it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I messaged him two or three years ago
on Instagram and said, like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you remember that stuff back in the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that was me or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just like, you know,
typing all this shit to me like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, my God, you're the world's greatest
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I got to shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to shake your hand, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of like it was cool because
I had always I had never actually come out
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to them or attempted to like say
it was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these years later, you can do that
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I talked to Chip and I was like,
hey, man, I want to breed something for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, breed breed a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've we've kind of like,
you know, we don't have like any business
[SPEAKER_00]: plans or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've kind of like in the back of my
head been like, man, I need to like like
[SPEAKER_00]: send him a bunch of jars of, you know,
having picked something, get a name to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe release some seeds under that name
and then maybe find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like he says he knows he's in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I know some cultivators down
here that will cultivate it for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with my name on it and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've we've talked about it,
but I haven't really like I need to put
[SPEAKER_00]: the effort in to actually like make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a bunch of jars when I met him
a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to they were just what I had on
hand at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like a attempt to come up with a
strain or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that buddy, that's a great story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I think that's a great place to
end it on as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to say thank you so much
for joining myself and Cosmic earlier and
[SPEAKER_03]: and coming on and telling your story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any shout outs or any plugs
that you want to do here at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have thought about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you've got to mention that already at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: SugarShip.co is where you can find stuff
about or information about my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super responsive on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people have questions, I love talking
to growers and love giving advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, what should I buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a hard a hard question
to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, what do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am super responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to reach out to me,
DK.Warren on on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Reddit name is a little harder to
