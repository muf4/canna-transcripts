with Gabby podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got our co-hosts Wolf and Cosmic
here and I'm delighted to introduce to you
[SPEAKER_04]: Sasha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sasha is from Slovenia and he has a
nursery in Austria and I met him on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had commented on some of the videos
that we had been making and when I started
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk to him I realized that he was
somebody that we absolutely had to have on
[SPEAKER_04]: this podcast to tell his story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know anyone in Austria
or Slovenia that's involved in cannabis so
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really intrigued by him and anyway
nice to have you on the show Sasha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have introduced Sasha is my
hobbit brother from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a big honor for me that I've been
contacted actually by you also like hey
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like I just wanted to make a
comment like I do normally when I like
[SPEAKER_00]: something you know I think it's quite a
lot to explain but I will be quite short
[SPEAKER_00]: about things but I've been growing up I
mean I was born in the end of 70s in
[SPEAKER_00]: Yugoslavia and particularly in a place
called Slovenia today because this was one
[SPEAKER_00]: other country when I was born you know so
Yugoslavia was you I don't know we will
[SPEAKER_00]: not do some geographic lecture now here
but Yugoslavia was one country that
[SPEAKER_00]: consists of many other many countries that
are today separate but this is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia Croatia Bosnia Serbia Montenegro
Macedonia and Kosovo we are we are the
[SPEAKER_00]: Balkans we belong to the European
peninsula that is called the Balkans we
[SPEAKER_00]: are called South Europe we are not the
Western Europe because the Western Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: starts like 10 meters from my house it is
because I am separated by a river between
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia and Austria historically this is
a very very interesting place for war
[SPEAKER_00]: times and bloodshedding you know like it
was a lot of blood was spilled here in
[SPEAKER_00]: this region a long time ago and you know
it's like there was a lot of war so
[SPEAKER_00]: culture-wise I've been growing up on our
property where I've been actually exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to a garden as a young child by my
grandmother I've been growing up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden you know like there was no
babysitters you know so my grandmother
[SPEAKER_00]: just said go outside you know so I went
outside so maybe in Mendocino where maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people are that listen all is
the same thing it's a wild we have
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia is half of the country's forest
we have two million people it's 20 times
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than California mostly people have
gardens here and still today people have
[SPEAKER_00]: garden at home so everybody grows food so
basic thing is that also everybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: not grow today or something in the sense
of not cannabis food or cannabis too is
[SPEAKER_00]: you inherited maybe a land even if you are
not growing up in a countryside you know
[SPEAKER_00]: because Slovenians normally they are
owners of land so there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: culture of gardening that's the first
thing so normally when you when you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: culture like this that everybody has a
garden and I that have been exposed to a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden as a child and been growing up
without internet without phone without the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we know today as common sense
you I've been interested in ants and
[SPEAKER_00]: butterflies and this stuff first because
you know as a kid you search for that but
[SPEAKER_00]: after a while I realized today because I'm
dealing a lot with plants today is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you you I was exposed to plants all my
life so I came to the realization in life
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't tell you my whole story because
this would be for another podcast but how
[SPEAKER_00]: I come to eat is my parents were very
open-minded in that times and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like the hippie generation you know and
weed was also cannabis is itself as a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was my grand-grandfather was a hemp
farmer in old time Yugoslavia so we used
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow hemp you know hemp we I as a child
I know a machine it's not a machine it was
[SPEAKER_00]: on it was a big cutting knife for cutting
hemp stems you know because you what we
[SPEAKER_00]: grew my ancestors grew hemp was because of
fiber they grew it for rope they grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: for you know it was a material you know
nobody smoked hemp yeah please so you said
[SPEAKER_04]: that most people have land in Slovenia yes
to me that was already something that's
[SPEAKER_04]: very interesting because in the US it's
not like that you wouldn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate you know some corporation that
would come and buy a thousand hectare of
[SPEAKER_00]: land here you know you don't have that so
people own their own land then they and
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they if I own it if they never
been to a farm because they live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ljubljana and grandmother and grandfather
died now so you inherit inherit land you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's yours now many people from
Ljubljana that don't own land in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sense they got a possibility to not even
Ljubljana everywhere you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: in Slovenia but I was living so long time
in Ljubljana so that's why I tell this
[SPEAKER_00]: capital of Slovenia is you know we are two
million people country it's like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a one big capital the third of
population is there because of it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: student place and it's the place where
centralization kicked in here really fast
[SPEAKER_00]: so we are politically really like
centralized country you know so the the
[SPEAKER_00]: periphery I call the countryside is quite
yeah it's how I tell it it's harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: live here but it's better to live here you
know I guess my question that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: know was is there poverty there because
like when you said that everyone owns land
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like very easy a poverty but
it's not a poverty in sense of your
[SPEAKER_00]: country you know we don't have people on
the street here in the countryside you
[SPEAKER_00]: have some some people in the street in
Ljubljana because they are heroin addicts
[SPEAKER_00]: or I don't know fentanyl kicked in also no
and you know that that stuff but in the
[SPEAKER_00]: countryside you don't have that it's it's
not that so there is no poverty in that
[SPEAKER_00]: center alcoholics you know because we are
a nation that does a lot of wine we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: wine culture like California does we have
a lot of where I live there is only one
[SPEAKER_00]: there is vineyards everywhere here yeah
there is exposure of sun here is also at
[SPEAKER_00]: the place I live is in east north east
Slovenia yeah which is south of Austria so
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the place that the most the sun is
in the year you're like we have outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountain range yeah so it's out of the
mountain range and also we have Pannonian
[SPEAKER_00]: region which is you know here was
Pannonian Sea the thousands years ago you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Slovenia is a small country but we
have like different regions where I live
[SPEAKER_00]: is flat then you have the little mountain
region and then have a high mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: region to the Alps Julian Alps and then
you have the seaside yeah and a lot of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is also forest all the time Slovenia is
traditionally a country that is growing
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat since I was born you know like
because it's of you know sometimes people
[SPEAKER_00]: think that wheat has been only grown you
know as a land race and then it came to
[SPEAKER_00]: Western Europe and USA and Canada yeah but
it came to Yugoslavia and all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries that it's all tradition here you
know but the different kind of cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: background with a different sense of the
cannabis we treat cannabis as medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: here cannabis is not I mean it's a
recreational drug of course but cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as a in a sense of cultural what I know
now that Slovenia will legalize soon I
[SPEAKER_02]: think and it will be because of medical
question really quick so yeah since it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like they may legalize soon what do
the current like what is the current
[SPEAKER_02]: political stance on cannabis like do they
do they ever arrest people for it or like
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and and I guess like that would be
like one question for like does like
[SPEAKER_02]: someone small who's just growing at home
for themselves as medicine as you would
[SPEAKER_02]: say like would they ever be prosecuted or
or would it just be there was yes yes I
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell you many things is there being
many cases now in the last years people
[SPEAKER_00]: have been prosecuted for all kind of
growing because there is a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who grow here I mean there is you don't
even know now anymore if it's left right
[SPEAKER_00]: wing people you know we don't have like
this political system of two-party system
[SPEAKER_00]: here it's many parties it's like the
Christians and the others and the one and
[SPEAKER_00]: the green ones and you know let's like
that so we treat cannabis as a cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and for example there being cases
that guys will growing five kilo of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and turning them into oil into
Rick Simpson oil you know everybody this
[SPEAKER_00]: is also a story but they turning it into
oil and they've been prosecuted for giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it to people and they've been freed
because of five kilo they had they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and they've been processing the
weed for oil and giving it out to people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are sick with cancer and these people
came with medical certification into the
[SPEAKER_00]: court with doctors that certified that it
helped them so the case was dropped and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and we are on the point we are on the
point now that two months ago or three
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago in August we have a referendum
you know how you call it in English
[SPEAKER_00]: referendum referendum yeah yeah people
being asked do you want medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: yes 60 or 70 percent yes do you want
cannabis grown in your own property as in
[SPEAKER_00]: a small scale you know what I mean like
you know three personal use yeah three
[SPEAKER_00]: plants five plants it was 51 percent yes
nice so government now is writing already
[SPEAKER_00]: the law they will present it before New
Year actually they say they will there is
[SPEAKER_00]: you know do you guys know international
business conference cannabis international
[SPEAKER_00]: business conference I see yes I know it's
called yeah the it's a conference that
[SPEAKER_00]: takes place all around the world yeah
mainly it was I was in Zurich and it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia in Bled and it is in Berlin and
in Vancouver and the guy that has this the
[SPEAKER_00]: CEO of this is called Alex Rogers he lives
in Ljubljana he's married to Slovenian
[SPEAKER_00]: wife she has a wife with kids there and he
has this this business thing you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Alex is somebody that I have to
tell you we've been I've been involved
[SPEAKER_00]: into music scene a long time in Slovenia
and also in the region of Balkans I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been working as a stage technician for big
bands and small bands and clubs and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I've been growing up with music I
cannot live without music music is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I need every day so still
but I choose cannabis for my profession
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Rogers is a guy we used to call jabon
he was with dreadlocks he was a guy that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from America and we have a sound
system we do Jamaican style dub music you
[SPEAKER_00]: know with with with records you know with
vinyls and you know heavy sound and there
[SPEAKER_00]: were people coming chanting you know
Slovenia is a lot a lot of Africans are
[SPEAKER_00]: there you know it is from the time also
for Yugoslavia because we were the
[SPEAKER_00]: independent between USA and Russia we were
not Russia you know Yugoslavia and Russia
[SPEAKER_00]: were separated so we work a communist
country but we were with African culture
[SPEAKER_00]: so a lot of Africans came to Yugoslavia at
that time so in Ljubljana there was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of Africans you know still today are
they are you know and you know we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: sound system culture so jabon Alex Rogers
comes there and chanting you know and I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew him as that you know and then he
disappeared and I was asking my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Ziggy who is making like papers Ziggy
papers we have here you know we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: Rizla you have OCB you have this we have
Ziggy papers like a zigzag yeah but zigzag
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very old company too but Ziggy papers
is from the 90s they are based in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ljubljana they are my friends they are
Rasta culture and they are making really
[SPEAKER_00]: really quality product I mean their their
papers are crazy good you know I love them
[SPEAKER_00]: so Ziggy is one guy you know and I asked
Ziggy because you were all sisters having
[SPEAKER_00]: sound systems in that time and Ziggy you
know Jamaicans used to come back into
[SPEAKER_00]: Ljubljana and we make covers yeah original
artists so and you know I will not be too
[SPEAKER_00]: long in this but it it was a culture and
then I called Ziggy up and say where is
[SPEAKER_00]: jabon you know Alex and he said hey it's a
problem I said what is he's been arrested
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany and I say why because he's been
he's been selling wheat in Germany and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said I don't know about that Alex was head
security of high times cannabis cops in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 90s you know he was there so I think
he did some shady business then and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: in prison I don't know two years or
something everybody knows today about this
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's telling his story also that's
why I tell it open here so Alex when he
[SPEAKER_00]: went out of prison started this ICBC which
is actually a business conference he's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get a place where guys come
together for cannabis business and he
[SPEAKER_00]: actually made a really good business with
it I mean he's everywhere every year you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and it's successful and he's the one
of those guys who lobbies in Slovenia for
[SPEAKER_00]: the law and he's actually very near not
only him but and he's the guy that the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not Slovenian or because we
Slovenians have from perspective of
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves like we are small people like
the hobbit that's why we the hobbits you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we are this hobbits who are like you
know Tolkien story this is the same I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't we are so small we think we can do
we cannot change the world or nothing we
[SPEAKER_00]: are just like leaving our gardens you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the ring carriers you know like joke Alex
is the guy who actually tells the story
[SPEAKER_00]: about Slovenia like this I'm admiring him
because he opened some window he says that
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia is the most tolerant country for
cannabis in Europe or the world and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like what you know and actually he
explains like this you can sit anywhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: any cafe in Ljubljana or outside and smoke
a joint which is true you can nobody will
[SPEAKER_00]: call the police nobody they will they will
tell you in certain places definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: please put it out but they never call the
police you know what I mean you will not
[SPEAKER_00]: have a problem because of that it is like
come on can you step like 10 meters away
[SPEAKER_00]: or you know and then come back to the
table or I don't know you know it is smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: might be bothering people so they'll ask
you to move away but yes like it's no
[SPEAKER_00]: one's gonna same is like a cigarette yeah
and also the wheat culture because so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people you know left right wing because
Rick Simpson was in Slovenia so long time
[SPEAKER_00]: already Rick Simpson everybody knows about
Rick Simpson I think yeah he went in exile
[SPEAKER_00]: from Canada into the world and he actually
stayed in the Balkans I think he's married
[SPEAKER_00]: to a Croatian woman or with her and he had
a stroke that's why he's not present
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore on the internet so actually Rick
Simpson is somebody that is not a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: you know but he's been spreading the word
about wheat and he's been growing actually
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada in Canada at that time and he's
been making a lot of this oil which is
[SPEAKER_00]: essential for Slovenian story because we
are the nation of Rick Simpson and Phoenix
[SPEAKER_00]: Steel's oil you know like there is so many
gardens there is old grandmothers that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis because of the oil nobody
smoke joins from this type of people you
[SPEAKER_00]: know but they they grow it for oil and of
course there is a long time culture of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking cannabis here also of course yeah
like everywhere you were telling me a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit about how in Slovenia you know
it's tolerant to smoke but you aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to grow or you're not allowed to
harvest flour so I think that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: something before we talk about your
business it is absolutely illegal that
[SPEAKER_00]: means the plant is already illegal that's
what I want to tell the plant in Slovenia
[SPEAKER_00]: is illegal but it's been used so much that
it's you know even if it's illegal it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still sweet you know like few hundred
kilometer from here is I mean it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: near the border to Hungary but in Hungary
there is some feral wheat growing
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere it's cannabis but it's 0.2 THC
or something but it's feral it's feral you
[SPEAKER_00]: know so it's gross everywhere like wild
wheat wild wild and nobody touches it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's really mean you know somebody
would say yeah it's we can work with it
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah you should but it's not my life you
know you know I don't have time for this
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is feral wheat which is really
wild wild so the culture of cannabis here
[SPEAKER_00]: is quite old very old that's why people
you know wanting a difference between USA
[SPEAKER_00]: and the place where I live it is always
been illegal but it's never been so
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecuted you know if you have a few
plants they will give you a bill nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: will put you in prison for that ever it's
been since I've been growing up like this
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's still illegal and people don't
really care so much about it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why legalization took so long
because it was not so you know you would
[SPEAKER_00]: not go to jail because of five to ten
plants you know you would not definitely I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean people went to jail but they normally
did other stuff too yeah you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: have like I know I mean one friend of mine
I will not tell his name he had 300 kilo
[SPEAKER_00]: of wheat been harvested from a greenhouse
fresh so 300 kilo would be how much 100
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo dry 600 700 pounds he was in prison
for one and a half years and he's out you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I mean it's like you will not
spend your life in prison because of wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's why people made the decision
also to grow big here they do so they did
[SPEAKER_00]: they you know I will not talk about too
much but it's still illegal here so have
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind yeah it's still there's still risk
but it's just less the story you told me
[SPEAKER_04]: about like you can grow weed as long as
you don't harvest it that what makes it
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal was that in Austria Austria okay
that's why I got confused so we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in a moment that's why because
I live on the border to Austria and
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia I've been growing up here I've
been born in Austria because my mother
[SPEAKER_00]: worked here in the town it's a town from
the 13th century it's a town that is like
[SPEAKER_00]: known for thermal spas you know tourism is
here and it's like for all people that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to enjoy their life on the end of
life it's a very quality place it's
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful surrounded by castles and and
forests and we have good breweries here
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a good nursery here so I the
law in Austria is like this you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of cannabis any kind of cannabis
plant cannabis is not a drug THC Delta 9
[SPEAKER_00]: substance is the drug so until the
cannabis flowers there is no drug you see
[SPEAKER_00]: they are practical in the sense of the
even you can go that far that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: assume that if you would grow at home the
plant till the end until it flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: you would not cut one flower from the
plant and you would have a police raid and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would not find any dry flower in your
house not any clue that you would use it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say to them that you actually use
it for aroma therapy because you go with
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands on the back to the plant and
you smell on it and that is your aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy every judge in the country will
free you because there is no there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: production of drugs when you don't cut a
flower from it you know what I mean it's
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like opium like poppies you don't
like in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_04]: as long as you don't cut it that's yeah
that's right you know until that you know
[SPEAKER_04]: because in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_04]: it's legal to grow poppy flowers it's
illegal to cut them and you know make them
[SPEAKER_04]: you know drop the sap that you know
becomes you know opium yeah then you
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the drug at that moment when you
make this action you know so in Austria
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like this that there is many many
shops with living plants already you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to buy clones in Austria 20 years
ago as a grower yeah so I turned my
[SPEAKER_00]: illegality into legality and I made the
business I went over the border here and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said okay I will make a company and I will
sell clones and they check you if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if you have any record you know
if you did something I didn't so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: clean so I could do that and I made a
facility with different cultivars that I
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered for 20 years because I have I
know a lot of people that grow that are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing I'm a grower still but I'm a legal
grower now yeah I just turned it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: business you know I have four employees
now we have also another company with our
[SPEAKER_00]: company his name is heretics heretics is
like herb ethics you know the herb and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ethics so heretics is a company in
Slovenia we have extraction company we do
[SPEAKER_00]: extract with butane gas with n1 gas which
is the most clean butane which is allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: in food production in Europe so we extract
all kind of materials all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: biomaterials you can get yeah so we're not
extracting only cannabis which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia we extract CBD and CBG cannabis
we are not allowed to extract THC because
[SPEAKER_00]: we are not pharmaceutical certified
company with GMP status we're not having
[SPEAKER_00]: that yet we try to in the future but you
know we are working on that for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time GMP means good manufacture practice
that means this is the standard for for
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs you know you can actually you know
sell it then for big money you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean but we are not we actually do a lot
of other extractions for you know we do
[SPEAKER_00]: serum oils which is which means you get
grape seed oil and different kind of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can extract the oils from this is
the oil which is called absolute oils and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use them in any shampoo any skin
cream normally the cosmetic industry comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to you and buys this you know so we
actually did this but in Austria we have
[SPEAKER_00]: this facility with cannabis plants which
is specializing in we have now 35
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars in our library you
know Gabby knows I've been sending a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days ago the list he knows about it is
it's a very interesting links I think
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm a I'm a nerd you know I'm a
cannabis nerd I'm listening you know how I
[SPEAKER_00]: come to Gabby because I listen to not so
dog for years and I listen to skunk every
[SPEAKER_00]: time I heard something was convie I go I
want to hear it you know like this guy was
[SPEAKER_00]: so incognito for me and the whole the
genetic that I really thank this guy for
[SPEAKER_00]: for some genetics that I acquired in spawn
abyss over the years that I know the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the American genetics are very
different from the Europeans first of all
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you grow now there it's so
craft and it's so made for also for looks
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of them are interesting some of
them are very boring you know it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's the truth you know it's not yeah
it is actually some of them are really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting because we as we meet people
we appreciate this but when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: some genetics that you because the the
lack of you know when you go only for THC
[SPEAKER_00]: levels when you breathe only for THC up
you know then I think the game changes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you lose some very good effects on your
body I think that's my opinion because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can smoke or consume cannabis that is very
much less THC and you have a better
[SPEAKER_04]: experience yeah I mean the THC levels
there's two things about it number one in
[SPEAKER_04]: most cases there's a good chance that it's
not accurate right because here the
[SPEAKER_04]: testing labs you know everybody's gonna
take their weed to the lab that says that
[SPEAKER_04]: they've got the highest percentage of THC
the other thing is we don't really know
[SPEAKER_04]: everything about cannabis or even maybe
the smallest bit about cannabis about what
[SPEAKER_04]: gets you high and you know all the other
cannabinoids that could be in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpenes and what effect they have
when you consume it yeah so I mean I was
[SPEAKER_04]: telling you a story yesterday the chem dog
it's one of the most potent weed you know
[SPEAKER_04]: I've ever smoked this I still think to
this day but it didn't test very high you
[SPEAKER_00]: know why as far as THC because the other
cannabinoids go ahead I have a theory it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because of terpenes terpenes are
consisting from mono and from sesque so
[SPEAKER_00]: they are like combination of it's a code
and it's so complicated that I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: need like 50 years of research for that
that we will we will a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: understand why you know it's terpenes all
the time I mean we have the Shiva the old
[SPEAKER_00]: Shiva we call it Shiva
[SPEAKER_00]: we tested Shiva for content Paul Hornby
did this which is very interesting guy I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to tell you about him Paul Hornby is
a Canadian he came he died a few years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: he was the researcher of cannabis very
very good one you know he's been working
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for 30 years and he's been
actually paid by the government of Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it research and he told me also that
the terpenes are the key to the thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: know everything every substance that you
have like CBD or THC or THCV or any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG doesn't matter the terpenes have to be
there also because of the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there is this kind of thing that
we still can explain today but for example
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed from the equator has a very
specific terpenes profile right right the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed from Afghanistan and Pakistan which
is actually OG and Indicus has also very
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar picture of the terpenes again
you know and but we don't still know the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences between those it will take us so
many years I think it's it's a very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: science actually to do I would assume
because somebody our children will figure
[SPEAKER_00]: that out for us I think so too I mean I
hope so it's just the weed the Shiva that
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I mentioned before she will get you
couch locked with 17 or 18 percent THC
[SPEAKER_02]: only what she has but I just I just knew
one that came out at 16 percent and that
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah but it was very very stony put me
right into the couch and yeah and I tried
[SPEAKER_02]: the other one that we grew right in the
same room same fertilizers and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: and it tested at I believe it was like 28
percent and it just didn't do anything for
[SPEAKER_00]: me yeah and on the other hand some yeti OG
that I have for years from Lumpa Farms
[SPEAKER_00]: tests for 25 percent I can smoke it I mean
not in the morning but you can smoke it's
[SPEAKER_00]: up lifting high it makes it's a headband
actually yep so it's like it's a back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross of headband so it makes you it
doesn't make you like this stone like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shiva cut which has less percentage a lot
like six percent less or something on the
[SPEAKER_00]: tests we we had it from the same lab you
know it's like but I don't believe in this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of test anymore because it's just a
PCR test I think you know like like you
[SPEAKER_00]: would it's not so it's not so accurate as
we think actually I think so right now I
[SPEAKER_00]: think in the future will be a much more
accurate picture of the test in the US
[SPEAKER_04]: when you do testing you can get the
terpenes tested and you know they test for
[SPEAKER_04]: other cannabinoids and stuff like that but
we still don't know what that means so for
[SPEAKER_04]: instance if it you know something tests at
two percent THC well or not TC terpenes
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah well the different terpenes could
have a different effect on people and
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe it only takes one percent of those
terpenes to have a dramatic effect where
[SPEAKER_04]: other strains might test at four or even
five percent terpenes but does that mean
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's gonna be more potent no I mean
often it'll mean that you can smell it
[SPEAKER_04]: more you know which is nice definitely yes
and maybe taste it but as far as the
[SPEAKER_04]: effect we just don't know like you said
hopefully our children will figure this
[SPEAKER_00]: out for us yes and also you know here in
Slovenia there is a lot of farmers that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in the seaside region they grow
lavender a lot I have a very good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a weed grower and also lavender
grower you know and he's testing his
[SPEAKER_00]: material so he says for the lavender that
is testing normally for six percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes but he has two strains of the
lavender not the cannabis the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender but the one with four percent
that he has smells much much more powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: explain it to me where the six percent
does not smell that much than the four you
[SPEAKER_00]: know because of testing for terpenes
terpenes yeah so but you know the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: is they make the steam distillation very
old all this is three thousand year old
[SPEAKER_00]: technique technique to get out the
terpenes you know I told them already that
[SPEAKER_00]: they should taste it in my facility with
the butane because we will make it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower temperature and we will get the full
spectrum you know from the smell only you
[SPEAKER_00]: know because the terpenes you can with
butane is beautiful to extract the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes you know it's really yeah it's
better than any other so when I also
[SPEAKER_02]: wonder just because of the like even
within cannabis we only test for terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's other volatile organic
compounds that are giving off a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: smells that we're picking up you know like
yeah like a lot of people hunt for like
[SPEAKER_02]: roadkill skunk smell and stuff like that
that can't be explained through a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profile but can be explained
through things like methyl groups and
[SPEAKER_02]: different different other like carboxyl
groups it it doesn't necessarily just fall
[SPEAKER_02]: into terpene so it's I also I also just
wonder how much of that is playing a role
[SPEAKER_00]: in the different effects felt by different
off absolutely and the thing is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned it already know you know the
thing is that it has to go on the research
[SPEAKER_00]: I think until we didn't research it we
don't know I have here I want to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: this is one book it's from 19 to it's 120
years old now and there is cannabis inside
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you this is the book of my
grand grandfather this is this is poppy
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have here you have home and
then you have a picture of a male of a
[SPEAKER_00]: male they somebody grow they go and they
they they picture a male they didn't but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they put from
[SPEAKER_00]: Vienna or some somewhere some guy have to
draw cannabis now so he picked a male to
[SPEAKER_00]: draw this is a male plant you know yeah
but it's from 120 year old yeah the book
[SPEAKER_04]: and take some photos of the book for me to
include in the video I will I mean and
[SPEAKER_00]: also with the text is written with old
gothic so people who will know German they
[SPEAKER_00]: can read it you can read it I know German
so I read it it's very interesting because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what it mentioned indeed this
book for fertilizing the cannabis guano oh
[SPEAKER_00]: really but guano really I will make a
picture and you will see that's the origin
[SPEAKER_00]: of using guanos for cannabis yes my
brother you know when we were beginners
[SPEAKER_00]: all of us the growers what we were using
for fertilizing huh what were you reading
[SPEAKER_00]: in your first you were high you had high
times we had grow magazine from Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we were all reading about guano
soup you know like tea make make guano tea
[SPEAKER_00]: or buy the bird you know the bird guano
and the bad guano and always was guano we
[SPEAKER_00]: knew about I was reading about guano wars
man the wars of guano you know they were
[SPEAKER_00]: having wars for that for bad shit in South
America what I mean yeah yeah all times
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in the you can google it it's
true they were having pirating like they
[SPEAKER_00]: were fighting for sugar and you know all
kind of stuff they were fighting for the
[SPEAKER_02]: bad shit yeah you know yeah it's still
actually a problem there's still actually
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of slavery and child slavery used to
collect different bird guanos and bad
[SPEAKER_02]: guanos out of South America and it's it's
one of the least sustainable products on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market as organic problematic
absolutely problematic one of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: from Ljubljana went to Jamaica and he was
in some caves and they were harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: some guano because he was like this guy of
wheat you know like let's go harvest some
[SPEAKER_00]: guano you know they went into some caves
they harvest some guano but then he almost
[SPEAKER_00]: lost his lung because he's breathing this
shit you know it does yeah it's you know I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't want to get too far off topic but
you know when we talk about the difference
[SPEAKER_04]: between growing with minerals like hydro
nutrient or organics people for some
[SPEAKER_04]: reason think organics are clean but like
it's literally shit and yes you know and
[SPEAKER_04]: like wolf said there are you know children
dying and getting you know lung diseases
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're harvesting this stuff
without proper protection and without pay
[SPEAKER_00]: yes it's slavery it's terrible yes yes so
people should be aware I think I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware yeah we don't sell guano in my
shop I mean I I used to grow with it but I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do it anymore you know I don't
because it's I know it's also exploiting
[SPEAKER_00]: nature nature you know when you buy guano
you buy it because some they destroy these
[SPEAKER_00]: islands which is actually inhabited by
birds only or penguins only you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean one and the guano feeds like a
whole ecosystem within the caves that the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that the bats live in and so once you
have the guano you destroy the ecosystem
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of those ecosystems are you know
they're older than a lot of human
[SPEAKER_02]: civilizations they're they're thousands
and thousands of years old yeah we have
[SPEAKER_00]: this issue maybe I can talk about this now
because people have problems now here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia there is a lot of outdoor growing
let me tell you like maybe in Austria also
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a lot of people that grow outside
the problem is that from year to year I
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of more and more increase of
different predator you know we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: from the corn fields there is this worms
you know eating our butts then is this
[SPEAKER_00]: world that goes inside of your steam it's
crazy how much or it changed because there
[SPEAKER_00]: is no more winter here winter used to be
minus 20 degrees now they are like if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is minus one two you know you here
used to be a lot of snow half a meter now
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no snow since the last five years
wow yeah that's how it's going on now
[SPEAKER_04]: people think global warming doesn't exist
you know and the earth is right there in
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenia and so you're saying you're
getting a lot more of these different yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like these different ones because
yeah we never had them before and now we
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting again you know how we fight
against them we plant late in the season
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes you can escape the time
when this the butterfly goes and puts the
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs into your plants it's maybe later you
plant the later he can do it so this year
[SPEAKER_00]: we planted already some growers that they
went they came and they said on the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: July they get bigger plants you know so
they put them outside and there is not so
[SPEAKER_00]: much problems if you put them out too
early they are full of worms they are full
[SPEAKER_00]: of it's catastrophic from here do you use
any sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: no most of those people they don't want to
because we are used to grow organically
[SPEAKER_00]: here you know normally people never spray
their plants even you know maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation when they are vegetative plants
but not in flower don't spray nothing when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's flowering that is like ridiculous for
us you know like you will put it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: body no way you know so I don't even want
to spray organic stuff on flower you can
[SPEAKER_04]: you can I don't want to like you know like
not even I you know spraying anything on
[SPEAKER_04]: your flowers just as you know like for
instance people will spray products that
[SPEAKER_04]: are considered acceptable for organic
cultivation that contain an oil but if you
[SPEAKER_04]: spray an oil on your flower you know
you're gonna be consuming that oil yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Nick was gonna say something
about products that we use here for
[SPEAKER_02]: caterpillars yeah I was just thinking like
Bavaria bossiana or something that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like a like a myco insecticide where it's
basically just like a predatory mushroom
[SPEAKER_00]: that just attacks the yeah people here in
agriculture yeah they know about this
[SPEAKER_00]: because they use it you know we are far
you know the plants that we grow here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the area is all there is a lot of tomato
growers and all kind of salads here and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody has a garden so there is all
time all time grow yeah what I think also
[SPEAKER_00]: is point would be that you use nettle
nettle you know when you put nettle into
[SPEAKER_00]: water and you sit it for 12 hours you can
spray with it when you sit it for 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: you will kill your plants with it yeah
it's so strong because it's so strong yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a strong care yeah you need to dilute
it more and but actually everything what
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to know is in the nature
everything all the plants are there they
[SPEAKER_00]: have different elements so actually if you
would ferment them you would get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you know you would you don't
need animal products to do that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not vegetarian you know I don't tell
you because of that but I know that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible just the trace element you need
for example cannabis as itself is a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that consumes the most iron in the world
there is no plant in the world that would
[SPEAKER_00]: consume more iron than cannabis very
interesting also they use cannabis here in
[SPEAKER_00]: my region and in this area of the world as
a cleaning of the soil a remediation of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil sure when you put when you put hemp
plants which is for me when somebody says
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp is not wheat or hemp is not cannabis
it's cannabis it can it can fertilize your
[SPEAKER_00]: your your plants you know we have a lot of
hemp growing in Slovenia a lot of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: growing yeah so people who grow
traditional plants you know let me say
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional have a problem sometimes
because they are pollinated by hemp fields
[SPEAKER_00]: in the area which is problematic you know
how can you protect that you know because
[SPEAKER_00]: these things if you have a rainy season
and in this time you have luck but
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's very dry season and then
the pollen gets blown 10 kilometers not
[SPEAKER_00]: three as they tell you I had really good
clones outside years ago and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: this wapa which I still have in my
facility we call it the Isabella the good
[SPEAKER_00]: one the the one that smells so good you
know it smells like Isabella grapes I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if you know Isabella grapes
which we have we have a wine region and
[SPEAKER_00]: these are blue grapes very big one they
have this very sweet and they have this
[SPEAKER_00]: certain aroma is it for wine production it
is for wine production is there is that I
[SPEAKER_02]: might know it if there is a French
equivalent it is because French people
[SPEAKER_00]: came here 300 years ago and they made wine
here so we still use their tradition to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it you know we have sparkling champagne
wine which is not champagne because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not from champagne region you know right
is the same grapes you know grown in our
[SPEAKER_00]: region with the same process of how you do
champagne wine with sparkling you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing you know it's not crystal but
so these are called Isabella grapes if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are called Isabella but we call it
Yurka we call it Yurka in my language we
[SPEAKER_00]: say Yurka everybody knows what kind of and
when people come and they buy my clone the
[SPEAKER_00]: wapa clone from Paradise Seeds that I have
so long I got it from the mountains 2015 I
[SPEAKER_00]: got it from mountain region in Slovenia I
will not expose anybody but my friends I
[SPEAKER_00]: will tell from the mountains these are
very old growers they are older than me
[SPEAKER_00]: they teach me how to grow mums they teach
me how to do clones and then I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria and do my business you know very
much later the culture is there but these
[SPEAKER_00]: people growing they are living in the
mountains maybe Mendocino is the same you
[SPEAKER_00]: are far away from a town from a city and
you like to stay at home so these people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go to shops to buy clones you know
they keep their own mums their own
[SPEAKER_00]: selections their own in the beginning they
were not depending on nobody so the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing a little Mendocino a little
California in our country is there too but
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not tell which place because it's
so small but this in the mountains so
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the people who are who are
depending on nature they cannot survive
[SPEAKER_00]: just like that there is no shop you know
it's very similar you know the story that
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear from our countries I mean from
California especially and from USA as it
[SPEAKER_00]: is we are I mean we're still the same you
know I don't know I mean we speak
[SPEAKER_00]: different languages and everything but we
are all the same people black white
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese you don't name it we are the human
race actually we should go together out in
[SPEAKER_00]: space without wars and without anything
you know this is my idea of the future but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I'm a I'm a optimist so I like it
yes yeah I like it yeah that so you're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying this this Isabella it smells like
grapes it's very great yes nice I love
[SPEAKER_00]: actually they had two at that time those
guys are like that you know they have like
[SPEAKER_00]: numbering they pop few packs and they have
the numbers you know the Vapa number you
[SPEAKER_00]: know 25 or the Vapa number 3 or the Vapa
number 5 you know it's and then the winner
[SPEAKER_00]: from those my Vapa is the Vapa number 4
and they never could grew it in their
[SPEAKER_00]: region because they are in the mountains
but I live in the flatlands in my region
[SPEAKER_00]: outside she always performed always no
mold nothing in their region she didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: perform and they have another Vapa which
is called number 2 and the 2 I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any more but it performed for
them and after a few years they came back
[SPEAKER_00]: to me and said can you give us the 4 again
so we'll try it again maybe maybe this
[SPEAKER_00]: time it will work so I give it back and
they they have the same results they said
[SPEAKER_00]: no it's not working you know those are the
people who organized the Shiva cut back
[SPEAKER_00]: for me I can I can talk maybe a little bit
about the Shiva yes yeah I have few cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: you know this is very old in my facility
in Austria but the Shiva cut is very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting one it is one cut that a
friend of mine acquired he came back from
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam with this cut in 1997 and he was
one guy that was partying all the time you
[SPEAKER_00]: know he was one guy that is in the
hardcore punk culture of my country he was
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those guys you know really like
crazy crazy guy he went to study from the
[SPEAKER_00]: region where I live also to Ljubljana like
six seven years before I went to study so
[SPEAKER_00]: he went to apartment where one guy was
already a dealer a weed dealer that was
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the 80s so that we dealer he quit
to deal with but he got the customers that
[SPEAKER_00]: were used to come to this apartment so the
guy you know my guy I call him lucky let's
[SPEAKER_00]: call him lucky because that was his name
we call him lucky lucky took all his
[SPEAKER_00]: customers so he started to grow weed
indoors also because he went to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning of the eight and nineties
and he saw the indoor weed you know he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: guy from you know after Yugoslavia split
up there was no control Slovenia in a one
[SPEAKER_00]: moment had no visa for Iran or USA can you
imagine I could get I could travel to USA
[SPEAKER_00]: without a visa and in the next day I would
travel to Iran without a visa it's crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy you know it's crazy we had one year
that you could travel like this so he went
[SPEAKER_00]: but he went after also but he was this guy
you know and he actually acquired this cut
[SPEAKER_00]: let me say on a high times con of his cop
when he was a judge like he you could buy
[SPEAKER_00]: a judge pet because I was always thinking
long time that he was like chosen to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: judge you know which is for me a
ridiculous because who knows this guy you
[SPEAKER_00]: know from from Slovenia you know nobody
knew him of course he paid for for to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: judge because you have to pay to go from
coffee shop to coffee shop in the nineties
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the weed that they were like
judging on right yeah so how he get the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut will never be known because he got it
and he came with it but he always said
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the Shiva and we don't know is the
Shiva one Shanti Shiva Shanti one Shanti
[SPEAKER_00]: two is the Shiva skunk or is it the super
skunk because he said it is labeled SS you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and he always call it the Shiva he
said it's a Shiva so actually you know but
[SPEAKER_00]: is the one plant that is very very fast
flow flow fast rooting it is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: the fastest rooting plant in my facility
definitely it roots in the first plant
[SPEAKER_00]: start to root in six days they start you
know start and then on the tenth day you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to open the lid and put it out and
crazy crazy you know and all the prejudice
[SPEAKER_00]: what we cross because skunk va smells that
we you know we search for weed that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: related to this weed to make F1 generation
to make one good hybrid and we choose
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk va's gear in the beginning because
he was with the one with the Ken dog you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we couldn't get the Ken dog from you
guys at the time but still now we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have it but we wanted something that is
very very far away genetically from this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant yeah so we crossed it and we got one
hybrid from that which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best-selling plants in my facility now you
know nice yeah what do you call it Radigoi
[SPEAKER_00]: Express say the first word again Radigoi
Express Radigoi I can show you Radigoi
[SPEAKER_00]: logo that I develop no maybe it's turned
but this is a hand with a sprout this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I will put out in the future
sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: actually because you told me why because
it's hard to grow well that and because
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that have it hold it closely
people want to buy it but it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to buy it actually the only way
we could get to the flavor of this Ken dog
[SPEAKER_00]: which I believed that is the truth you
know is true skunk va's gear you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: the friend of mine which you shout out now
is old-school genetics from Barcelona is
[SPEAKER_00]: old man green and his crew of people that
grow those are true growers I love them
[SPEAKER_00]: they are the ones that still put out
regular seeds in European market which is
[SPEAKER_00]: a fucking rarity besides Shanti Baba and
Karma genetics nobody does it it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very rare to do that I mean Europe the
feminine seeds are dominating now and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: with Gabi we talked already about feminine
seeds we have both our different opinions
[SPEAKER_00]: about feminine seeds but both of us are
the same I think opinion that regular
[SPEAKER_00]: should not die out yeah never if we get
rid of males then we are fucked you know
[SPEAKER_00]: really fucked and also we agree on one
point that finding the real male is
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking fucking difficult it's the most
difficult maybe you will find it or you
[SPEAKER_00]: will never find it you will never find it
yeah I agree like maybe the guy somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who will find it will not know that it's
so valuable and he'll throw it away I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that is I think that happens with
females too yes yes definitely the male
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis plant is like the male cannabis
plant is the most underappreciated plant
[SPEAKER_04]: on the planet you know like considering
what its real value is to how little
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciation it gets it's it's pretty
ridiculous yeah it's like all trial and
[SPEAKER_02]: error with males and you gotta I feel like
the best ones that I've found it always
[SPEAKER_02]: structure and stem rubs like as long as
they got a good branching structure I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with them usually I mean a few years
ago I listen you know you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand I live on the other side of
this planet but they still I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: updated what you guys are talking yeah so
I listened to mean gene from MDC a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago and he tells theory like he has
one technique of finding males a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit better than you would normally you
have to grow them out for sure yeah but
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you grow them out you grow them and
then you find out it's the males you
[SPEAKER_00]: separate them put them into a place where
they are for themselves and you label them
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you wait that are like growing
and putting out the flowers and then
[SPEAKER_00]: before they're opening you're cutting them
you cut the most of this plant cut away
[SPEAKER_00]: and you leave the lower branches so they
have to grow again and put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: sex again and pollen right they are
getting older you have more of the aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: force from steamer up and maybe they have
some crystals you know so I haven't heard
[SPEAKER_00]: that one before I like that mean gene from
MDC not all these few years ago so but if
[SPEAKER_00]: you ask him he will definitely say yeah I
told it because that's a way how to skip a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit if you are trying to find from
one generation you know of males from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same you know brothers you know from the
same cross try to find the best one you
[SPEAKER_00]: know maybe the one that smells better not
looks better is the one you know because I
[SPEAKER_00]: choose a male that is looks good you know
but it's make actually pretty decent weed
[SPEAKER_00]: so I know you know you never know you have
to work work work work yeah something that
[SPEAKER_04]: I recently heard on another podcast and we
talked about it Sasha but I want to see if
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick knows anything about this I was
hurting hearing about reversing mouths and
[SPEAKER_04]: that when you reverse a male and try to
make it into a female you know it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna produce buds like a female but you
can get it to do something so that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get more of a smell off of it you
can provide a male with like ethylene gas
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements and have it produce more
female sex parts yeah it's it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: you can do but it's a it's a whole
different process because you have to have
[SPEAKER_02]: an enclosed chamber to provide the
ethylene gas exchange properly what Sasha
[SPEAKER_04]: and I were talking about yesterday was how
when people talk about selecting the male
[SPEAKER_04]: you know you're doing the best you can but
you know the only way to really select the
[SPEAKER_04]: male is to pollinate plants with it and
then grow those plants out and then
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinate the same plants with another
male and then grow those plants out that's
[SPEAKER_04]: the only way you can tell which males
doing better work we can make guests
[SPEAKER_04]: guesses but I think it's a lot of
arrogance when people think that you know
[SPEAKER_04]: they Fino hunted a male you know and also
you know these are the same people that
[SPEAKER_04]: they say they feel you know Fino hunted a
male from a 10 pack of seeds you know it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like proper Fino hunt you need many many
seats and you know picking one male out of
[SPEAKER_04]: five you know males that you got out of a
seed pack that's not a Fino hunter it's
[SPEAKER_04]: luck you know if you get something good
it's a hell of a lot of luck yes I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: females are obviously easy you see them
you can smoke them you can smell them
[SPEAKER_04]: right so choosing a female you know is
easier choosing a male you know like it
[SPEAKER_04]: requires people that people that shot
pollen get a lot of a I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_04]: grief but you know they look they get
looked down upon by you know people that
[SPEAKER_04]: are real breeders but you know the real
breeders are doing the same thing they're
[SPEAKER_02]: chugging pollen the real breeders they
don't know until they're using their bases
[SPEAKER_02]: like with anything that was like anything
that has OG in the lineage or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that has sour diesel in the lineage it
that's what they're they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: accidental genetics I mean who does lime
breeding today you know like real lime
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding to multiple generation lime
breeding so there is a guy that I met on
[SPEAKER_04]: reddit and he goes by lemonhoco and that's
what he's doing and you know when I listen
[SPEAKER_04]: to him I'm like this is one of the real
breeders of today you know that's you know
[SPEAKER_04]: where everyone else is doing a lot of
pollen chugging he's actually trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: make you know stabilized lines like that
like skunk tech with his like Larry OG f9s
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever but he's he's already taken to
like that I think he's out like that 10 or
[SPEAKER_02]: f11 stage at this point that's where the
different burger strains come from and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like the guy that found GMO and stuff
lemon lemon Larry OG
[SPEAKER_02]: lemonhoco and then I'm talking about skunk
tech that did like Larry you know I only
[SPEAKER_00]: know all these people because of Instagram
you know for example how I came you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: will tell you now how I came to you guys
actually first guy that I really followed
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a guy is a guy named named Duke
Diamond you know he has this Dominion seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company and I actually know about him
because I I am a really big fan of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: Cindy 99 strain which came from brothers
Grimm seeds at a certain time in the 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: and I like the story how he cubed it and
he made back crosses several generation
[SPEAKER_00]: back crosses until he found the Cindy 99
yeah and then I heard about how it was
[SPEAKER_00]: resurrected by an American guy when I was
like who is this guy and it was Duke
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamond and over Duke Diamond I came to
skunk VA because they were like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still find it on YouTube there is some I
don't know affair where they sit together
[SPEAKER_00]: and they having a talk on the stage both
of them and I think after that Duke went
[SPEAKER_00]: to prison again and he disappeared and
then he came back and I think he's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most underrated good readers in USA
the shit that he does I mean I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: but I from the far that what I can read
and I can see this is the most humble guy
[SPEAKER_00]: next to Shanti in Europe that I know the
most humble guy ever I met him I never met
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke I hope I will I hope he's he's good
he's well he's living a good life with his
[SPEAKER_00]: family now I know that he's done time and
it's been horrible what he has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through definitely I mean what this guy
has but the genetics that he put out have
[SPEAKER_00]: you seen the logo of him he has a Virginia
logo with instead of the guy that lying
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a skunk with us with a butt is
over it standing on it you know and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the minion seed company and all the gear
that he's putting out I mean and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: came to skunk VA and all the came up story
and everything around it yeah so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why we sit together here without Duke
diamond I think and all the stuff I heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about him I would not be so motivated to
listen to the story because he's very
[SPEAKER_00]: professional humble guy the guy that grew
up in countryside like me he knows about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants he has a torture chamber before he
puts out gear can you imagine he's he's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out the gear to the stress that he
can explain to you if there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: manners in the eight nine week no no don't
worry you know it's just you know so he
[SPEAKER_00]: explains the genetics with very truthful I
mean nobody writes about seeds like him
[SPEAKER_00]: does and you know that's fantastic I mean
he's a marvel and I I don't have no seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from him would like to have one day you
know but you know I got to skunk VA seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and I consider them actually have seeds
from him because I bought the first
[SPEAKER_00]: generation of Brothers Grimm seeds when
they came out again I think Tommy his name
[SPEAKER_00]: is Tommy Duke Tommy was working on those
so I got the Rosetta stone I got the the
[SPEAKER_00]: see the 99 we had we had a clone for years
and we don't have it anymore but we have
[SPEAKER_00]: still some genetics from him still so hey
I want to interrupt you real fast Sasha I
[SPEAKER_04]: want to say that my hope and dream is that
someday this podcast that we're having
[SPEAKER_04]: together with you does the same
inspiration for someone else you know and
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly you know like you know you're
in Slovenia and I'm in California and
[SPEAKER_04]: Nixon Oregon and you know Instagram or the
podcast or whatever it it brought us
[SPEAKER_04]: together you know we always talk about how
it was 6,000 miles away but we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to each other live and seeing each other
live so hopefully more people from
[SPEAKER_04]: Slovenia and and you know throughout the
world will be inspired by conversations
[SPEAKER_04]: like that like this but I want to get back
to talking about your nursery and what
[SPEAKER_04]: what growing cannabis in Austria and
Slovenia is like I started my nursery in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 yeah I mean started it started for me
as a business because I was working for
[SPEAKER_00]: other people before yeah in Austria this
business is already more than 35 years so
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years and I started my business
business five years ago so when I went
[SPEAKER_00]: into this business it was already a 20
year business in the country so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: asking myself do you have to offer
something that you can compete because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you have to compete you cannot be
some idiot fuck and start a business with
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know if you don't know shit so I
did you know and I was successful in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that I my all the library that I
have before I acquired clones from other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries I put in myself because of my
connections I got clones from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains I got my own clones I got clones
from the flatlands I got clones from you
[SPEAKER_00]: know let me tell you this you know like so
many people contributed to this library
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not only mine this is not my
library this is also people who died
[SPEAKER_00]: already they are gone but I still keep
their plants alive and the legacy goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's a beautiful thing in that
sense that I can still sell the Shiva cut
[SPEAKER_00]: which is lucky you know lucky Scott he
even asked me before he died you know
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know lucky died like this you
know I knew about that did that he has
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer a one friend called me like lucky
has cancer and like 45 months after they
[SPEAKER_00]: called me that he died so he was like it
was really fast and he I met him on a
[SPEAKER_00]: concert before before even know that he
has cancer or something and he told me can
[SPEAKER_00]: you name that cut after me said I will his
name was stretch co and that means lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: in our language to stretch up means luck
so his name was stretch co the lucky one
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and he was the lucky one in that
sense and the library consists of many
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts like this one of those cuts is his
Shiva the another cut which is very old
[SPEAKER_00]: came from Graz it's Santa Maria it's a
plank cut we call it it is a production
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from the 90s from Holland it's a
very much sativa dominant plant but a very
[SPEAKER_00]: fast flowering you know it has seven and a
half weeks of flower indoors it's a silver
[SPEAKER_00]: pearl f7 crossed with Mexican something I
don't know you know it's like the there's
[SPEAKER_00]: very interesting story about this plant
because I was attacked by one year ago I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to change the name of my list because
it's only plank clone only now before that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Santa Maria plank no mercy supply
was the company that put this clone out
[SPEAKER_00]: and no mercy supply is a company from
Holland from the Netherlands which was
[SPEAKER_00]: owned by a guy named cease and he was a
legend I don't I don't know much about him
[SPEAKER_00]: but I got last year threatening mail that
I should put this plant out of my list and
[SPEAKER_00]: that is his intellectual intellectual
property and you know I just said okay I
[SPEAKER_00]: will remove the company the no mercy
supply you know I talk about it now but
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like people should know funny you are
giving him credit I give him and he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't want the credit he did yeah no and
I said to him hey I'm admiring you you are
[SPEAKER_00]: the breather can I send you the cut of
course for free it's yours right and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was like even more threatening me that he
will come to the Balkans and you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: said come to the Balkans man
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so but I don't you know I'm not
dealing with this kind of energy in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life I'm a positive guy you know I want
I'm a I'm a library librarian I like
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping genetic material alive for the
future generation and I I know that this
[SPEAKER_00]: plank cut is definitely older than any cut
in my facility because in nine two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand five when I first see it in Graz
in Austria I saw it in Graz in a shop
[SPEAKER_00]: called psycho Nova and still exists and
the guy that runs the shop is called
[SPEAKER_00]: Marion Marion is one of the nicest people
on earth and he's the guy that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of my facility you know as a
room and he's keeping 50 strains you know
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like you know of each cultivar he's
like one or two plants only and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting you know and caring for it and
everything and he has a small shop and he
[SPEAKER_00]: helps people he helps people out like you
did Gabi I think with your shop like so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people that benefited from your
energy and from your experience you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same it's the same story
everybody in Graz you know this is south
[SPEAKER_00]: of Vienna you know Vienna is the capital
of Austria Graz is south it's the capital
[SPEAKER_00]: of Styria the land where we live so this
shop still sells plants they don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: any advertisement they're like the one you
know have to search them you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: search them they're not like my site Gabi
I have I'm not really advertising but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I mean it's like I have a site
you know this guy does not he has a Google
[SPEAKER_00]: info site or something you know with a
list of clones and he's still doing his
[SPEAKER_00]: thing he's the oldest one and and Marion
told me when I acquired the clone from him
[SPEAKER_00]: 2005 he told me hey Sasha this is the
oldest clone I have and I said how old is
[SPEAKER_00]: it it's like it's 15 years definitely from
the Netherlands you know and that was in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2005 so 90s so 90s you know like end of
the 80s nobody can know for sure yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody can really know for sure I don't I
will not argue because we all know these
[SPEAKER_00]: weed stories yeah I think not so was
talking about it a lot how we have our own
[SPEAKER_00]: perception of each card that we acquire
you know people live through life and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody really thought at a certain point
of time that it believes it will be so
[SPEAKER_00]: important you know I didn't you know that
the cards that I have maybe for you the
[SPEAKER_00]: most interesting in my facility is the
least interesting cards for the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are around me you know they all want
the American cut snow they all want Cali
[SPEAKER_04]: weed you know but we already have that and
the other thing that's become super rare
[SPEAKER_02]: here is sativa you know like seven week
flowering sativa I was like yeah that
[SPEAKER_04]: would sell really well week flowering
sativa that grows short short it cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: handle its own weight that's also it
produces too much dense flowers to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you have to met you have to put
me because my own weight either when you
[SPEAKER_02]: say sativa do you mean in effect or like
is the flower structure no the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: structure is absolutely indigo it has
three leaf tips it has three leaf when you
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it on seed finder you will find the
real cut the Santa Maria plank cut that's
[SPEAKER_00]: it it is going to make a note but there is
like you know because the seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: still sells it a seed they went into f8
because this should be f6 or f7 because I
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired it so long time ago it is a
silver pearl cross to Mexican I think you
[SPEAKER_04]: know and what are the leaves look like you
said the bud but does it have fat leaves
[SPEAKER_04]: like an indigo or is it more skinny leaves
like a sativa oh it is a mix between and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has three fingers only always not only
sometimes five but mostly three and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling like mango fruit and it has only
14 to 15 percent THC it's a very uplifting
[SPEAKER_04]: plant it sounds amazing I haven't had
breakfast and I'm drooling I'm like people
[SPEAKER_00]: tell about it you know there is a whole
story about this particular cut that is
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Brazilian Amazon used for ritual
purposes blah blah blah blah but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: all fake I think this is not true this
they bred it in Holland maybe they got the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics from South America maybe but they
it was stabilized and bred in Holland in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the greenhouses yeah so it was a it
was a purposely bred plant for production
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely it looks like this I mean if
you something that oh go ahead Nick if
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali if you know Cali weed is what people
want out there now what do you keep as
[SPEAKER_02]: selections of that style of weed in your
in your other program okay there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: time a few years ago when I acquired a
first four clones from USA genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: those are insane in the membrane from
ethos a wedding cake Portland we only know
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the wedding cake Portland female
over we don't know seat no breeder no name
[SPEAKER_00]: no nothing then the Mac we we first
thought is the Mac one from Capulato but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not it's Mac V2 because we searched
we asked them the guy again who gave us
[SPEAKER_00]: this cut and he's show us the package and
it was Mac V2 it is still in seed form
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the clone only version it's good
one it's really nice selection it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: and another one which is the wedding cake
insane which one wait I will have to see
[SPEAKER_00]: and the skittles cookies that what I
wanted here the skittles cookies is a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that we also don't know the breeder
but the skittles versus cookies you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a good it's very similar to Mac those
are the first four and we got it from a
[SPEAKER_00]: source that they will not name no then the
second round of America clones we got from
[SPEAKER_00]: finest condoms in California and we got
them by coincidence coincidence means I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in my shop one day two years ago
almost and a guy that is my actually a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know he's also working for UPS by
the way you know for the delivery and he
[SPEAKER_00]: came with a package and he said Sasha you
owe me 560 euro this is like $700 or $650
[SPEAKER_00]: and I I was like Yuri why you know I don't
know why I didn't order nothing for $600
[SPEAKER_00]: hmm you know so he said to me look at the
package and I'll say package is from USA I
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the you know what the paper is USA
okay and I open it because I said to him I
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot pay you $600 if you if I don't know
what is inside because I order nothing and
[SPEAKER_00]: open it and they were hidden inside into
into small zipper bags clones and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones have names it is Apple banana
jokers 31 grapes and cream a push crusher
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie crusher you know the shit I ordered
nothing where did it come from it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: gift from the cannabis guts and to have
those show up on your doorstep that's
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy you know yeah and give it to me you
know thank you but who yeah I will not
[SPEAKER_00]: tell from which country now yeah but in
2021 I had an export which is official
[SPEAKER_00]: from Austria to a country that is outside
of Europe it is outside of Europe it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: European Union yeah and it's a company and
they I exported officially to this place
[SPEAKER_00]: with food and rock administration it took
me four months for the paperwork very
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated these same people went to USA
and buy clones and send it to me first
[SPEAKER_00]: because they knew that they can import it
again because otherwise they could not be
[SPEAKER_00]: imported because of the paperwork I will
not tell who it is I will not tell which
[SPEAKER_00]: country it is but it's not you to
understand these clones were also sent to
[SPEAKER_00]: me without being rooted they send it in
one day and the next day they were in
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria from California on the route
that's crazy in tissue which is wet in zip
[SPEAKER_00]: bags that are closed and I got a lot of I
mean and so we have still have all those
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics then at your facility or did you
just kind of were you a pit stop for them
[SPEAKER_00]: no I I keep the moms cool I keep the moms
those are some good ones I I have a few of
[SPEAKER_02]: those at my facility that I that I work at
what was weird about that story is that
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't ask you first they didn't say
hey Sasha we want to send these genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't get them we want to send them to
you and then you know I mean tree was the
[SPEAKER_00]: destination but we won't talk about that
here no yes so I acquired also these
[SPEAKER_00]: American American genetics from which I'm
very you know I am excited of course I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you know I'm totally excited about it
but on the other hand some of them are
[SPEAKER_03]: really boring yeah you're gonna find a lot
of them are and that there's a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are similar you know if you breed only for
THC that's what I wanted to tell before if
[SPEAKER_00]: you only breed for THC and looks it's not
gonna the end product will result in lower
[SPEAKER_00]: quality for the experience I think because
on the end what do you care about how the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed looks when you when you consume it
right I mean well hold on let me just say
[SPEAKER_04]: this that's like saying I'm gonna try to
say this delicately what do you care about
[SPEAKER_04]: how beautiful your woman is if you're
having sex with her right you know so I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean like I think I think physical
appearance isn't as important as we make
[SPEAKER_04]: it in you know but I think it does mean
something and I do think that you can tell
[SPEAKER_04]: something about the quality of cannabis by
looking at it right so when something
[SPEAKER_04]: looks better when something looks better
yeah but I mean right right chem dog with
[SPEAKER_04]: some shitty looking weed it really didn't
look great you know the way it smelled you
[SPEAKER_04]: know so you have to kind of look at all
the parameters you know first the way it
[SPEAKER_04]: looks and the way it smells you know then
of course you smoke it you know or consume
[SPEAKER_04]: it however you would do that but you know
it's the same with any any plant right
[SPEAKER_04]: with all plants we breed for looks okay
even in you know the organic section you
[SPEAKER_04]: know of the supermarket where I shop when
you look at the tomatoes they like to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the tomatoes that have lots of different
colors right you know the heirloom
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties but you know people want their
food to look pretty you know you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to put something on a plate that's
ugly and it's it's kind of the same thing
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabis also in the US particularly
or I think it's probably everywhere but
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely in California you don't even
get to smell the weed before you buy it at
[SPEAKER_04]: a dispensary no don't you get to see it in
a jar right so the only way right so the
[SPEAKER_04]: only way you can get away and it gets
worse so the way you judge weed when you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know right when the average consumer
who is not a cultivator he goes into a
[SPEAKER_04]: club they can look at two things they look
at what does the bud look like you know in
[SPEAKER_04]: a jar and then what is the THC content
right those are the two metrics that they
[SPEAKER_04]: have to make their decision so a lot of
the breeding for high THC is based on the
[SPEAKER_04]: bureaucracy of that's one of the two
metrics that people have to choose their
[SPEAKER_02]: weed right when it was only it was one of
the only metrics that was able to be
[SPEAKER_02]: quantified early on as well and so that
like when you went into a dispensary like
[SPEAKER_02]: in the 250 prop 215 days you would maybe
get THC I think you were able to get THC
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage in most of the places that were
fully licensed they would let you smell
[SPEAKER_02]: the weed back yeah absolutely something
you know you touch it if it was just like
[SPEAKER_02]: their their grab jar or whatever they
called it at the time but yeah they still
[SPEAKER_02]: like THC was still the only actual
quantifiable metric that they could give
[SPEAKER_00]: you I give you I give you a one example
you know I got a lot of inquiries from
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany now right now you know from April
this year because Germany legalized and in
[SPEAKER_00]: one day to another you can actually send
plants to Germany which was absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible before that absolutely and I
was not even I'm the last shop in Austria
[SPEAKER_00]: that start to do it because I'm there I'm
the guy that will you know look for I will
[SPEAKER_00]: not be you know in any risk of anything
because I can lose my whole business just
[SPEAKER_00]: because one one male you know I will not
do that so we tried to know how many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants we can sell to Germany to one
person in the beginning nobody knew and
[SPEAKER_00]: now we know that it's like they can grow
three plants we can send five plants we
[SPEAKER_00]: can send seven seeds per person it's still
gonna be like it is a personal use you
[SPEAKER_02]: know so any German citizen can order from
you yes oh that's really cool yes it
[SPEAKER_00]: started no that's why you know and my
genetic library is also it's very vast for
[SPEAKER_00]: that and people who like weed you know of
course German is a big market you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they they already called me years ago if I
could send plants like I always say no
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's illegal yeah they even
Germany even had a law extra law for not
[SPEAKER_00]: selling canopy seeds in the country even
seeds were forbidden which in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries are not they are souvenirs
they are sold as souvenirs which you as an
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 or older year old person can sprout in
your country or not depending on your law
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so Germany is a big market now I
want to tell you this that I get inquiries
[SPEAKER_00]: every day almost and I don't sell to
everybody because I don't want to risk you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some some people ask for too much and
but I you know the things that we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: our facility as genetic material grow
people that does not you know in your
[SPEAKER_00]: place they cannot buy this because it's
too expensive but they are hobbits so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow it and they grow it and you
change perceptions you change perceptions
[SPEAKER_00]: you help people with cancer you help
people with different kind of diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: they are you know I'm not actually for
that that everybody should cook their own
[SPEAKER_00]: oil at home because people are stupid also
so they would use bad solvents and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I'm for that that the government
takes over and has the standard you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality control for that you know that
would be appropriate in a civilized
[SPEAKER_04]: society that doesn't work here that
doesn't work here you put it in the hands
[SPEAKER_02]: of the government they're gonna fuck it up
how many countries are you allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: export to legally all Europe if they have
a permit I have a European I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: European passport for the plants is is
Germany the only country where the there's
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational grow or personal grow I think
yeah personal grow yes well Holland you're
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to grow you're allowed to grow for
personal no I don't know I thought you
[SPEAKER_04]: were allowed to grow like five plants or
something then that could be you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg yeah of course Luxembourg they
can grow and Malta and Malta they can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: okay they have legalized cannabis and
Spain but Spain we cannot send to Spain we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried the plants won't survive I mean even
if I send it express it's like also Spain
[SPEAKER_00]: got so much weed yeah it's it's crazy we
go to Spanabis every year because there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where I meet my people you know I
can also meet American people you that can
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that's the only point where we
can meet actually and we do and it's nice
[SPEAKER_00]: you know yeah that would be awesome yeah
it's a big party also Barcelona is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic place to have party and it's
great food there's great people there
[SPEAKER_00]: people yeah great yeah it's positive vibe
absolutely totally and the Spanabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: itself is some it's like a free it's free
you can smoke everywhere you know even
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona the social clubs are really I
mean you have to follow rules of course
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you're not standing in front of a
social club in front of Barcelona
[SPEAKER_00]: screaming in the night drunk you know and
hi you don't do that because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and they always tell you walk as
soon as you're out walk you know and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything with you because you are not
allowed actually you are allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume cannabis in these certain places
but it's not allowed to buy like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much and then go home I mean of
course logical everyone does but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: very quiet about it and they respected the
rules that's why you know yeah and you you
[SPEAKER_00]: want your club shot being shot down where
the best wheat is for you no you don't so
[SPEAKER_00]: actually you care you care people cannabis
people always care we are we are not
[SPEAKER_00]: alcoholics we are not you know we are not
people who are on cocaine we are not
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin addicts we are not we are the
normal people we're pretty everyday normal
[SPEAKER_00]: people calm you know we have our habits of
course munchies maybe is the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible food yeah yeah otherwise we are
creative people we are musicians we are
[SPEAKER_00]: artists we are activists we care other
people don't so you know I think cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: people is great people not all of course
not all but you know a great majority yes
[SPEAKER_00]: a great majority of course everywhere you
go in the world you know I mean if I would
[SPEAKER_00]: stumble on you man it would be a party we
have we would have to talk a lot like to
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby we just met a few days ago or the
internet you know we talk every day now we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk every day now for hours yeah it will
be normalized in the time but but actually
[SPEAKER_00]: we will meet all day one day in person too
and I'm really happy all this you know so
[SPEAKER_04]: me too you know yes like I felt lucky to
be able to talk to you for the last you
[SPEAKER_04]: know week that we've been talking we've
been talking like every day like really
[SPEAKER_00]: late your time I'm like putting you to bed
you know my kids are going to bed in 20
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes we talked later in the day you
know other times as well and yeah I'm just
[SPEAKER_04]: glad that we get to tell people a little
bit about your story and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: culture in Slovenia and Australia Austria
yeah yeah I hope people find it as
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting as as I am and I know Nick is
as well I mean it's just so fascinating to
[SPEAKER_02]: just hear from someone similar mindset in
a different area of the world like you
[SPEAKER_04]: know we talk about I see the photos of
your grow it's it's so beautiful you know
[SPEAKER_04]: it's so clean it's like a retail
environment you know and it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: something that you see every day over here
and you know like they're being like a
[SPEAKER_04]: place that's that's legal to just buy
plants like that it doesn't even exist
[SPEAKER_04]: here so here what happens is like you can
have a nursery no you can have a nursery a
[SPEAKER_04]: licensed cannabis nursery that maybe they
sell to a dispensary right and that
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary has a couple of plants there
that they don't know how to care for you
[SPEAKER_04]: know because they don't have cultivators
there you know so the plants are basically
[SPEAKER_04]: just they're dying yeah you know like you
know dispensary you have to buy them like
[SPEAKER_04]: the day they show up you have to like talk
to the dispenser you want to say when do
[SPEAKER_04]: the plants show up nine o'clock on Monday
so nine o'clock on Monday you got to be
[SPEAKER_04]: there waiting in line so that you can
choose the best plants before you know
[SPEAKER_04]: they get hurt or or picked by other people
so when I saw the photos of your place so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's you know that's either that or you
can order clones online but even that is
[SPEAKER_02]: still somewhat of a risky business just
because it's falling still under the the
[SPEAKER_02]: US hemp bill or the the farm bill that
includes the hemp bill but it's something
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be repealed at any time and
then that's the only legal way that seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and clones are being shipped across state
lines and even within states now so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not nearly as open as that I feel
like Gaby was also just as blown away as
[SPEAKER_02]: me just to hear that you can ship clones
to Germany to a home grower yeah that's
[SPEAKER_04]: that's insane that's so cool but what he
has is you have the like yeah you have the
[SPEAKER_04]: phytos what is it called the phytosanitary
certificate so that's basically like if
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody wants to ship any plants you know
not cannabis of course but any plants
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the US you're supposed to have
that certificate just to ship it from one
[SPEAKER_04]: state to another and in Europe that's the
way it is for you know the whole you know
[SPEAKER_04]: you know all the continent of Europe is
that you know because they have the
[SPEAKER_04]: European Union you can ship it and the
plants are considered legal and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing I was Sasha was telling me about
is how like once a month or you know very
[SPEAKER_04]: often they come to inspect you to make
sure that your plants have no virus and
[SPEAKER_00]: right you want to tell a little something
about that it's once a year Gaby once a
[SPEAKER_00]: year but they are very you know if you if
you they see everything first of all let
[SPEAKER_00]: me not say that now that new virus came
the the the hope latent you know that is
[SPEAKER_00]: now that they of course don't know about
that from when they see the plants but
[SPEAKER_00]: they make the the tests the deep scans
they make you know it cost 500 euro every
[SPEAKER_00]: time they come every year yes so it's like
you pay also for other they check for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything there is like they check for
mosaic and for tobacco virus also not only
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplattent you know there is other viruses
still the hoplattent is more prevalent now
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis for the last years but I think
in the future there will be others and
[SPEAKER_00]: endo fights will come you know skunk VA
was talking about this one week or two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago in a podcast on the on the he
talks about the truth actually we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight this shit you know especially with
older plants with older cuts that been old
[SPEAKER_00]: through the closets and all kind of
environments that they been through you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be careful I mean you know
hoplattent is so like a like a white fire
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you cannot stop it if it comes so
yeah it's like the tissue culture thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: real so we have to do it actually all of
us I think do you have a tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: lab set up not yet but we are working with
very very much now it's gonna be very fast
[SPEAKER_02]: now yeah I feel like that'll be such a
such an amazing way to also have genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: imported with with as little risk as
possible found this so fascinating to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: from somebody else that has you know a
genetics library as large as you do that
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're keeping it in such great health
with with such strict regulations that's
[SPEAKER_02]: very impressive the regulations for the
health of plants in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: out here are basically zero until it
reaches final product like you there there
[SPEAKER_02]: would be no testing for any pathogens even
in the final flower of plants the only
[SPEAKER_02]: thing they would test for would be like
molds and that's not even necessarily the
[SPEAKER_02]: case or wasn't necessarily the case in all
the different states that have legalized
[SPEAKER_02]: you know from the inception of their
legalization they just didn't have that in
[SPEAKER_02]: place to to test for molds or pathogens
and now only some of them test for molds
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of them it's only for the like a
mycotoxin that could have formed from a
[SPEAKER_02]: mold so they don't actually test for like
the molds themselves but it's just it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just really fascinating to hear that like
you're you're required by the local or by
[SPEAKER_02]: the regulatory body to have inspectors
come in that you pay for the testing and
[SPEAKER_02]: have the proper testing done to their
specific standards like that's I'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that if the US goes legal that's how it's
gonna go as well where it's going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: these more stricter standards and it's
just interesting to see that it yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: there's models already out there where
this is happening there is there is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually it's very smart to do that
because otherwise we will infect each
[SPEAKER_00]: other with different kind of stuff that
you you know it's not it's it's grown here
[SPEAKER_00]: but I send it to you in to America and the
whole economy will drop because of some
[SPEAKER_00]: virus you know it's like yeah that's not
it is irresponsible to do that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very responsible to have a
certification to pay for that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that normally people that ask do you take
test regularly on a regular basis yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: test but one time in a year on the on the
government basis not on uncertificated
[SPEAKER_00]: labs that will tell me PCR tests that I
don't buy you know that is like he tells
[SPEAKER_00]: me is 20 euro a test it's so cheap yeah
but it doesn't mean anything to me I
[SPEAKER_00]: rather pay 500 euro to have it really done
the professional way that ISO
[SPEAKER_00]: certification that is also required for
shipment into other countries if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: that I will pay it if not you I will not
you know that's very legitimate important
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yes it is and it's also for other
crops not for cannabis only I mean oh for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure this system was this was built for
other stuff you know cannabis just came in
[SPEAKER_00]: now you know what I mean I mean the tree
plants that I'm in my life is associated
[SPEAKER_00]: is with cannabis first of all I grow
bamboo a lot Gabby I will send you some
[SPEAKER_00]: videos of my bamboo gardens because I have
a lot of bamboo here nice and tomatoes I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a vast library of heirloom tomato
seeds which is from all around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly here from my region in Serbia
Macedonia Kosovo Slovenian old varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: also Indonesia because I live there for
some time you know a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds so I my Trinity is cannabis bamboo
and tomato and in when I'm old guy I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be beekeeper because Slovenians are
beekeepers we have a tradition of
[SPEAKER_00]: beekeeping beekeeper habits yes you know
that's why we are so hobbit and we are
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna have to continue because we have so
much more to talk about but I just want
[SPEAKER_04]: you to say anything that you want to say
in the last two and a half minutes before
[SPEAKER_00]: we we have to say goodbye yeah I want just
to say tell the people that I will spread
[SPEAKER_00]: the love all the time I'm a small guy from
nowhere and we are all overseen by the
[SPEAKER_00]: mighty answer unseen force that makes
everything possible so let's keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind you know don't complicate you know
it's life is too short that's well well
[SPEAKER_04]: this a podcast we're calling it grown with
love from Slovenia and I hope our
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship gets to grow like the plants
that you do yes brother thank thank you
[SPEAKER_04]: very much cheers thanks for joining us as
well wolf yeah absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: this episode of gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the breeders direct seed
[SPEAKER_04]: company in my opinion the breeders direct
seed company is your premier source for
[SPEAKER_04]: clones and seeds and they are the only
place that you can get the Gabby Staten
[SPEAKER_04]: Island collection so visit breeders direct
for all your seed and clone needs you you
you you you you you you
