[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody this is Gabby Staten
Island coming to you from beautiful Sonoma
[SPEAKER_00]: County, California and I wanted to talk to
you about some an exciting announcement
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm gonna make at least it's exciting
for me and I hope you guys are excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about it too or get excited about it So as
many of you know, I've been doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting on the craft growers network It
actually all started off on I made a
[SPEAKER_00]: channel called Gabby Staten Island where I
wanted a place to tell my story and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that I want a place where many
people can tell their story not just my
[SPEAKER_00]: story you know while a lot of people want
to tell their story there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that don't realize how interesting
their story is and how much people would
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy and benefit from their stories
perfect example is Sasha from Slovenia he
[SPEAKER_00]: sent a comment on one of my Instagram
posts and you know, I started talking with
[SPEAKER_00]: him and then the conversation went to man
you really need to tell your story and at
[SPEAKER_00]: first he was surprised he didn't think
people would be interested in his story
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know the response has been
tremendous and so I think we've proven
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know there's a lot of people that
don't know that they should tell their
[SPEAKER_00]: story and I hope we can convince them to
do it here I've talked to a few small home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and asked them if they wanted to
tell their story on our channel and the
[SPEAKER_00]: response is always like well I just have
this one tent why would anyone want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear from me and what I'll tell you is is
that if somebody posts a video of their
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow that's going to inspire more
people to grow than if we post a video of
[SPEAKER_00]: a giant corporate cannabis farm right
because when they see your tent with four
[SPEAKER_00]: plants growing in it they say to
themselves man maybe this is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can do you know it makes it more
approachable so yeah I definitely think
[SPEAKER_00]: that home growers can inspire more people
to grow and so we want to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and we want to hear everyone's
stories we want you to tell us how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a part of your life and if you
grow how you grow so yeah that's my idea
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're gonna give everybody a place to
do it here what you're gonna need to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need to have some type of
online service like Dropbox or Google
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive where you can put the videos and
send it to me because you can't email me a
[SPEAKER_00]: five-minute video and yeah just try to
have your garden clean maybe think about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're gonna say for a few minutes
before you post the video but don't be too
[SPEAKER_00]: intimidated by it and don't think people
won't be interested and you know one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you is that like for instance if
a small grower were to make a video and
[SPEAKER_00]: post it to YouTube you know probably no
one would see it very few people but our
[SPEAKER_00]: channel we already have thousands of views
on all of our videos and so by giving us a
[SPEAKER_00]: video that we can post you're instantly
gonna expose it to thousands of people and
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that this idea becomes catchy and
you know this is a place where like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: before we can inspire people to grow and
share their stories anyway let me know in
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments what you think and if you
have any questions you can you know put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the comments or send me a PM and
please follow us and subscribe on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and YouTube and help our channel
grow you you you
