[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are the only place that you can
get the Gabby Staten Island Collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Gabby from the Craft Growers
Network, and we've got our Slovenian
[SPEAKER_02]: Hobbit brother joining us today,
as well as Nick Wolf and Cosmic,
[SPEAKER_02]: and our special guest, Michael Wolf
Siegel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have two wolves in the house today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the wolf pack today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Wolf is a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known him for many years on social
media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a very interesting story that I
think you guys will be very interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the person that invented Sea of
Green, as well as other cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a wealth of knowledge about
cultivation, about lighting, but he's also
[SPEAKER_02]: got a super interesting story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's all give him a big welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how you doing, Wolf?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good this morning, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to be able to share some of the
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we should start by you
telling us a little bit about your
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your first experiences with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am a second-generation cannabis
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in 1956, but I've been
consuming cannabis since 1955.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents were Greenwich Village beatniks
in a time when Greenwich Village in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York was really a lot like a village.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the artistic community was very,
very tight, whether they were musicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: painters, writers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father, Crazy A.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Siegel, his day job was as a second
violinist for the Carnegie Hall Symphony
[SPEAKER_00]: Orchestra.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he loved to do and what his
preferred thing was he was also a studio
[SPEAKER_00]: musician, a session musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when someone came to town that needed
a violinist or a fiddle player to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: the different styles, they'd send for
Crazy A.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Siegel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that circle included, among others,
Jack Kerouac, Mary Travers, Sally Gross,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives me like one of my first sort
of, I don't know, it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually can honestly say that I
consumed cannabis with Jack Kerouac before
[SPEAKER_00]: I was alive or before I was born anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, not many people can claim
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I voluntarily consumed
cannabis, was in 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can remember the date really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was August 6th, which appears some
other times later on in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my mother and stepfather called me
back into their bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lived on Bitter Lake in Seattle and
said, we know that sooner or later,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be other things you're
going to want to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't tell you not to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we'd like is if you're going to
try something, come to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us what you want to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you something that isn't messed
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then took my first tokes, like a lot
of people on their first experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know I was getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like, well, okay,
hold your breath and count.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know how high you are by how hard
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll change your sense of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it sounds a little different,
but you can't really put your finger on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first voluntary,
conscious consumption of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things picked up a little speed from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1969, I was 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought my first lids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were real honest to goodness
lids, not four finger lids, not a weight
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, but the amount that your dealer
grabbed out of the kilo, because it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: kilos usually then, the amount that your
dealer grabbed out of the kilo and put on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top, the lid of a one pound tobacco
tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually Bugler or Top were the brands,
but the cans were about yay big around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a lid about that big around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were good friends, I would say
it was more like a five or six finger lid
[SPEAKER_00]: than a four finger lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to put it in the bag,
and the bags were the fold type flap
[SPEAKER_00]: sandwich bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank God we didn't have COVID
happening then, because there was an awful
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of plastic that got lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've sold my, I bought my first lids
and sold my first lids in 1969 up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ave in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The University Avenue was sort of the
Seattle's version of the Haight-Ashbury a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years later than the Hashbury.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 68, 69 into the beginning of 70,
and then like the Hashbury, too much
[SPEAKER_00]: speed, too much heroin, the scene sort of
fell apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first experiences of selling pot
were of course lids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a place over on campus,
a block over from the University Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: One block, yeah, a block over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the fronts, the guys that would
front you the lids to go and sell them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to the people walking by,
it was a very street scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Haight-Ashbury invented street
dealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because from what I hear, it was a lot
like what it was like on the Ave in 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd walk down and 20 different people
would ask, hey, you want to buy a lid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Acid, mescaline, and eventually speed,
heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, it's like, I think that social
phenomena take, it's a lot like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: drop a rock into a pond, you got these
ripples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rock that's hippie, 1967 San
Francisco, Haight-Ashbury, is hippie,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1968, headed into 69, University Avenue,
is hippie, State Street, and Harris,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bellingham, Washington, 19, late 69,
on into 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I arrive in Bellingham, Washington in
1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip a lot of the in-betweens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home left me a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was out on my own at 14, and my
choices were pretty much at 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: steal, deal, or sell your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a thief, I wasn't into selling my
ass, so that left me with dealing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'd already done some of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start hanging out up on Western Wall
Street, Washington State University,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a university now, it was college
then, started hanging out on campus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I pretty quickly can see who the
fronts are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm dealing, and I had happened to
have, the very first deals that I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hooked up with by this guy that I
had met selling the Helix, the underground
[SPEAKER_00]: paper in Seattle, this guy, Frank,
he was of Mexican descent, and when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started dealing, I reached back to him,
because he was hooked up with La Familia,
[SPEAKER_00]: which there's a lot of different stories
about what it was like back in the 60s and
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s, and who was doing what.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding in 1969 was that
cannabis, although then it was pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time I call it pot,
was that pot as an industry was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much controlled by a few groups,
one of which was a group that uses a name
[SPEAKER_00]: that now I hear as a prison gang,
or is used by a prison gang, La Familia in
[SPEAKER_00]: the West, or generally just referred to as
La Familia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend Frank's uncle in Portland
was the northern end of a pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So twice a week, I would have college kids
drive me from Bellevue to Bellingham,
[SPEAKER_00]: down to Portland to pick up a 10 key
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: By early 71, I was one of the biggest pot
dealers in Bellingham, which is a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good sized college town, but in the summer
of 71, or excuse me, summer of 70,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did what a lot of us were into doing in
those days, which was what I laughingly
[SPEAKER_00]: call a pharmaceutical vision quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case, the ethnogen that I was using
was LSD, pretty good LSD, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was reputedly Sandoz, it was on sugar
cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I ate some acid the same day that
earlier in the afternoon I had read Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: Drake's The Cultivator's Handbook of
Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that book, there is a really,
really, really well written description of
[SPEAKER_00]: the quantum leap, how electrons move
further out and further out, and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: falling, release the energy that they
have, and that that's where light comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not being artistic in my
description of it, but something about his
[SPEAKER_00]: description stuck in my head and one of
the things I experienced on my
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical vision quest was that
quantum leap, where I was experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: what I had read, or believed so,
because I think our minds make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we perceive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I go out to The Point, which is a
place in Bellingham, it's on the south end
[SPEAKER_00]: of Chuckin' Up Bay, and a place a lot of
people used to like to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out and melt into the rocks and the
waves, real good combination, nice
[SPEAKER_00]: sensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while I'm out there, I notice this
giant, white, wooden frame triangle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I step through this triangle,
and now I'm not where I was, and I am in
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of, god, this sounds so
hippy, I'm in the presence of the goddess
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja, who tells me about what my life is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of what I remember now,
I didn't remember immediately right then,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it I did, but one piece of what I
was shown was cannabis growing under what
[SPEAKER_00]: I called indoor suns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, many years later, what I'm talking
about is 1981, in 1986 I went back and
[SPEAKER_00]: asked the people where I had been living
at the time, did I really come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about growing under the sun indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some validity, objective,
okay, at least this part of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I experienced and told these
people about the thing I believed I had
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot more skeptical,
now I always, I'm trying to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific about stuff, so I always put in
seems to, and might have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: because just a more effective way to
communicate more honestly, and I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: on, by the time I leave this plane,
I don't want to have to come back because
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have had my karma, my karma will be
balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the course of this experience,
this pharmaceutical vision quest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize I want to grow pot, I want to
grow cannabis, and I'm a pretty good size
[SPEAKER_00]: dealer at that point, so I start saving
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was August of 1970, excuse me,
and I start saving seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by the time late May of 71 rolls
around, I've got, call it a pound,
[SPEAKER_00]: pound and a half, so 25, 30,000 seeds,
and I go out to play Michael Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd read on the road, I knew a bunch of
people had done the hitchhiking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like a standard, well,
it's on my, we didn't have the phrase
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket list yet, but it was on my bucket
list to go grow pot, and so I got a ride
[SPEAKER_00]: down to Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was illegal to hitchhike in Washington,
and they would bust in, take you away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I knew that with that many seeds,
that was probably not going to be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get down to Portland, and I start
hitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hitchhike up, down, and across highways.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that know the west coast
of the United States, the area that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: about to describe includes what's called
the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the Emerald Rectangle because I
was going up and down Highway 101,
[SPEAKER_00]: Interstate 5, and across the roads that go
from Alturas, California, over to Redding,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 196, and the road that goes from
Crescent City, California, up to Grants
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass, which is 296, and then I can't
remember the number of the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: but from Coos Bay, you kind of have to
zigzag way the heck north to get back over
[SPEAKER_00]: to I-5, but pretty much every place inside
that area if you drew a line from Big Sur
[SPEAKER_00]: to the mountains, and another line from
Coos Bay to the mountains, pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: every place in that rectangle,
I planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hitchhiked, and every time my gut said,
here, I'd have them let me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd walk up from the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost invariably, this was someplace
where there was water running under the
[SPEAKER_00]: road, or there was ponds, and I'd walk
until I couldn't hear the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd plant, as many as felt right,
then I'd walk back down to the road and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang my thumb out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things were too slow going in the
direction I'd been going in, I'd go back
[SPEAKER_00]: the other way, because I was just out to
play Michael Marijuana Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I succeeded to the point that
it's probably, I'm not going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, but it's probably an accurate
statement that there's no place in
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California or Southern Oregon
that I wasn't one of the first hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: people to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure, you know, I'm not going to claim
to be one of the first, but the first
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred I think is probably pretty safe,
and it was, you know, partially it was
[SPEAKER_00]: based on what the names, like there's a
line in a Donovan song, The Season of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Witch, that says you've got to pick up
every stitch, and my mom and stepdad had
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, new stepdad from the one I
first smoked pot with, but my mom and new
[SPEAKER_00]: stepdad had basically taught me that
picking up every stitch was like
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting everything you saw as many
different ways as you could to try and get
[SPEAKER_00]: as much of an understanding and grok,
for you stranger in a strange land,
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Heinlein readers, and grok what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can I ask you a quick question,
Wolf?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, say again?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a quick question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you were like planting seeds
on the road, but did you ever go back and
[SPEAKER_02]: check out the plants and see what happened
with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that some of them did well,
but there's kind of a sad thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was up in Portland, I heard that
there was sugarcube acid, really good
[SPEAKER_00]: sugarcube acid, up in Bellingham,
so, you know, I was already in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hitchhiked up, as was pretty much
standard with me, I dealt lids a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money, and I got busted in Bellingham
dealing on, again, this August 6th date is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a recurring date for me, I got busted
on August 6th, 1971, at the corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: Harris and Fairhaven, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never got to go back, I heard that
they had been busted, like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: intervening time, that some people at my
biggest patch, which was a quarter of an
[SPEAKER_00]: acre just outside of Wonder, Oregon,
I heard they had been busted, and I had at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point been selling trim, you know,
just leaf, because homegrown, it was worth
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 bucks a pound during drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sold that, and got up, I think it was
like 7,500 bucks, and sent that down to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the people who had been working the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent the money down to bail those guys
out, and that's why I was dealing lids up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Bellingham, instead of having a little
of the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, we managed to locate my
mom and stepdad, he was on work release up
[SPEAKER_00]: in Alaska, for dealing, oh, that's part of
the thing that I had left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom and stepdad were also, that's how
they made their money too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got busted while I was out on the
road, but he was out on work release,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they hitchhiked down to Alcan to show
up in court when I appeared before the
[SPEAKER_00]: judge, and I got released to my mom,
which was kind of cool, because we,
[SPEAKER_04]: go ahead, say again, Oh, I'm laughing
because I'm just like, what a different
[SPEAKER_04]: time to compare to what I know of has
happened to people today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well also, imagine if the judge knew that
your mom and dad were also weed dealers,
[SPEAKER_02]: they probably wouldn't have been so quick
to release you to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The irony of this situation in retrospect
is humorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You reminded me, so I have to include
this, my stepdad had a joint fallout
[SPEAKER_00]: during the hearing, of his stocking cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately, no one seemed to notice
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up having to, my probation
officer, because I got released on
[SPEAKER_00]: probation eventually, I mean, I got
released to my mom, but they put me on
[SPEAKER_00]: probation, and I ended up being on
probation until I was 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the summer of 72, I only planted
a couple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, growing has also been a political
statement, because I can't think of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that more adequately fulfills the
definition of the pursuit of happiness
[SPEAKER_00]: than putting something in your own body to
change your mental state, if that isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was raised very politically,
my mom and father had been, besides being
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenwich Village beatniks, they were
freedom riders down south.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom, when she came back, when I'd been
in foster care at eight or nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: when she came back, we used to go hang out
down at the Nisqually Delta in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: on weekends during the fish-ins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish-ins were an effort by the
Nisqually to regain their tribal
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition and regain their treaty rights
to fish, which had been granted to them
[SPEAKER_00]: under the Stevens Treaty, and then the BIA
just ignored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a decision called the Bolt
decision that came out of that that broke
[SPEAKER_00]: the logjam on tribal recognitions and
treaty rights restorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mom was a pretty impressive person,
and I'd like to do honor to her memory by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what I can, which is what I've tried
to do in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a journalist, besides all those
other things, and I sort of followed that
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis, slipped into that,
I'll get into that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 72 I plant, just a few plants,
73, I graduated from high school,
[SPEAKER_00]: planted a lot more plants, worked various
jobs and planted guerrilla gardens up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jump ahead, it's 1975, I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy brings out a book as Murphy
Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy owns the Indoor Sun Shop in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located right near the university,
and they were the first shop I know of
[SPEAKER_00]: that was selling high-intensity discharge
lighting to grow plants with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 1975, the book he put out was How
to Grow Marijuana Indoors Under Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know if that book is still around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that book still available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Murphy Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either 75 or 77, and then two years
later, which would make it 77 or 79,
[SPEAKER_00]: he put out a book called How to Grow the
Finest Marijuana Indoors Under Lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where the transition from VHO,
from very high output fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: over to HIDs really took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, the only guy who were using
HIDs were people who were pretty hip to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, who were stealing streetlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, mercury vapors, then halides,
then sodiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understood light a lot less than the
mercury vapors have a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet C in them coming off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not a good combination of
wavelengths for plants to grow under.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I call the luminal harmony or
spectral harmony had some sour notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Halides are a little closer to what really
works for plants because it had more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue that they need and it had some
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scene in Seattle was kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I've referred to myself,
Ed, because someone else did it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the Forrest Gump of ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep being in the right place at
the right time and find myself in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy's indoor sun is really where
indoor growing... Other people had grown
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even much earlier, because if you look in
Mary Jane Sue's book, Superweed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was actually a guy who wrote under
that name, but Mary Jane's Superweed,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Connoisseur's Guide to Cultivating
Cannabis, has a light recipe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always given Bill Drake credit for
having the first book written in modern
[SPEAKER_00]: times in English about growing cannabis
for social use, but then recently was made
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of Mary Jane's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, not that recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're 68, five years ago is recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was made aware of that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in talking about it online,
Dave Watson, Skunkman Sam, came on and
[SPEAKER_00]: told me, no, there's a book even older
than that, and it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a book by a guy named Langdon,
L-A-N-G-D-O-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Skunkman Sam made me aware of it,
and now there's a guy named Don Lang on
[SPEAKER_00]: LinkedIn, and I got ahold of him because
he's involved in cannabis, and I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, Lang, could this be the same person?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it was his uncle, and I believe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a pretty cool hemp operation
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that book, Bill Drake's book,
got me thinking about it, got me out
[SPEAKER_00]: planting outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy's first book got me growing
indoors under lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I read it, I went and bought a
set of VHL lights over at Indoor Sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I actually got all the way through
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stuck this eight-foot fixture in a
six-and-a-half-foot closet under a
[SPEAKER_00]: stairway, so part of the light was hanging
out of the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the closet was like two feet wide,
so I ended up using staples and pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaners to do what nowadays would be
low-stress training, and what before it
[SPEAKER_00]: was low-stress training was plant bondage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess someone decided plant bondage was
politically incorrect, so it became
[SPEAKER_00]: low-stress training.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, how many outdoor grows did
you successfully complete?
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you were doing gorilla grows out
there in the wilderness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had done probably a dozen outdoor crops
in different spots, of which six or seven
[SPEAKER_00]: actually got to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have things like, well,
the one that finally turned me mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, which is having this wonderful
crop in the middle of a multi-hundred-acre
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry patch, doing the Viet Cong
thing with hand clippers, going in,
[SPEAKER_00]: tunneling in to the middle of the patch,
pulling these plants in under the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants so that something flying overhead
won't see brown, putting plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: hauling water into them all season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this plant that was the prettiest
plant I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one plant must have been 12 to 15
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had decent flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers were probably two and a half
to three inches across, not counting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like a week from harvest,
and I come back to take it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's all been bulldozed by a
contractor putting together a residential
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continued to grow outdoors, but I began
shifting to indoors really heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened in 79 or 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I had noticed,
and this is sort of debated today too,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of us had the feeling that
indoor-grown cannabis smelled great,
[SPEAKER_00]: looked great, tasted good, was fucking
no-high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a lot of people say that outdoor
wheat has legs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the term that they use.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high lasted so much longer than
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's partially that you get CBN that's
in... If you read Michael Starks' first
[SPEAKER_00]: book, Marijuana Potency, one of the things
he talks about CBN doing is extending the
[SPEAKER_00]: nature of the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six terpenes, I can't remember
their names, I'm sorry about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are six terpenes that you will
never find on indoor cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you find on outdoor cannabis,
or that have never been found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing on indoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's UV outdoors, both B, well,
ABN, but the primary photoreceptor for UVB
[SPEAKER_00]: is, the wavelength is 280.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got very little of that even outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors in greenhouses, unless you
specifically bring in a light source that
[SPEAKER_00]: will give you that, you aren't going to
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse coverings, except for EFTE and
one type of glass, don't pass any
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths below 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is what makes everything else
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is radio, light is the song that the
sun sings to summon the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants want, and each plant has,
each variety has its own favorite song it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to hear to get just what it needs
from the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go real deep into light
and lighting this time, but one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I believe is that the crystalline
structure of our nutrients, if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the molecular level, our nutrients are all
crystalline structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early radio was tuned using crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The length of a radio wave compared to a
light wave is roughly proportionate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the crystals that were
being used to tune radar and what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got going on as far as crystalline
structure of our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a plant has specific nutrient needs
that it does best, what we're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: tuning the receiving end of a
transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Society of Agricultural and
Biological Engineers now calls plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically active radiation,
and that's the full range, from 800,
[SPEAKER_00]: big wavelengths are low frequency,
from 800 to 280, short wavelengths are
[SPEAKER_00]: high frequency, the frequency is how often
the waves are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more often the waves are made,
the shorter the distance between their
[SPEAKER_00]: fronts are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, for accurate portrayal,
we want our low frequency, high number,
[SPEAKER_00]: long wavelength to be on the left-hand
side of an image, and our high frequency,
[SPEAKER_00]: short wavelength, low number to be on the
right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I'm sorry, I mean to do this at
another time, talking more... No,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, no, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I identify... We're not going too deep
yet, but that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: ...and a lighting freak.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're passionate about it, we like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you took the same clone and you drew
it indoors versus outdoors, what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: saying is the outdoor sunlight would help
that particular plant produce different
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids than the one inside,
is it able to produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the different wavelengths,
if we think of them as a harmony,
[SPEAKER_00]: then what happens is the peaks of our
waves at the different frequencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can get it so the peaks are arriving
at the same time, they do something called
[SPEAKER_00]: constructive interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this does is, like a chord in
music, say you're playing a G chord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, G is your dominant note in that,
but there's three notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time from when you start that musical
note by hitting the key or plucking the
[SPEAKER_00]: string or blowing on the reed till that
sound is gone is called... That time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the length of time is the duration of the
period of resonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it's resonating, when you've got
reverberation from it, the time that a
[SPEAKER_00]: chord, those three notes, together last is
significantly longer than the period of
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of any of the individual notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same thing is true in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens, and this is something
that people can demonstrate for themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: at home because, and I'll tell you right
now, what I'm telling you is heresy
[SPEAKER_00]: according to conventional photobiology or
conventional plant physiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Bugbee hates me because what I say
does not agree with what Bruce Bugbee says
[SPEAKER_00]: and what conventional photobiology
believes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, eight to 10 photons result in the
release of one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one electron results in one
photosynthetic incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to conventional
photobiology, frequency is irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's music, it's radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we bring all our peaks together at the
same time, instead of photosynthesis being
[SPEAKER_00]: a term that I've invented or coined,
capacitatively sequential, in other words,
[SPEAKER_00]: one proton or one photon, two photon,
eight photon, electron, it becomes photon,
[SPEAKER_00]: photon, photon, photon, photon,
constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of it being eight to 10 photons
result in one electron, and then signal is
[SPEAKER_00]: lost, and then regain signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, when we regain signal, the process
of regaining signal takes energy away from
[SPEAKER_00]: our transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you prove it at home is you
sit at a radio and you dial in a song you
[SPEAKER_00]: like at the very beginning of the song,
so it sounds properly tuned in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now turn it slightly off of the correct
dialing, some of the signal's gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add amplitude, more energy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding amplitude, so more energy's
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding into your transmission
process, and what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the signal comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've regained that lost signal,
but it sounds shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's distorted because the energy that
you're spending to overcome electronic
[SPEAKER_00]: inertia is not now delivering signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you turned it up, you pulled it in a
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it so that all told, you've gotten
three turns away from proper tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it at that impulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it at proper tuning and return the,
or wait, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it at that amplitude that,
what you've made up for the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: correct tuning by turning up amplitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it at that and now go back to the
correct tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a lot more signal available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same thing is our plants taking light
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photoreceptive pigments that,
you know, like keratin and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophylls, the carotenoids,
the anthocyanins and anthocyanins,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those biochemicals, those
photoreceptive pigments are doing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing botanically that frequency-specific
components in a phased array radar are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sending out or receiving specific
frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as they come back together,
where they're received, they get mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: back up into what's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at the correct relative
amplitudes and all of your frequencies are
[SPEAKER_00]: arriving as close as possibly in the
correct phase, right, so their peaks are
[SPEAKER_00]: arriving where they can reinforce each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called constructive interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where this all matters and why I'm talking
about this is because this is a huge piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of what I hope is going to be what people
remember me for is bringing HEP,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing high-energy plasma to their
awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cut down on the electrical
consumption from lighting worldwide by
[SPEAKER_00]: about 65% by replacing LEDs and HIDs and
incandescents with high-energy plasma for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything except interior home lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll go into that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense for us not to do
everything we can to save our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only one we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only one, I mean, I don't have
kids except for the kids of my intellect.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, everyone who grows cannabis indoors
or out is sort of, I regard them as the
[SPEAKER_00]: children of my heart and the children of
my mind because they're doing what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing what I've devoted the vast
majority of my life to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back, so it's 75, 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown my first crop indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've liked it, but it's not really given
me a good high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone I talk to feels the same way,
but it's got commercial value,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we grow it, but mostly we keep nicely
done outdoor for head stash or Hawaiian or
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, my stash was hash plant
grown in Northern California because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was really good or a Northern California
outdoor or a Hawaiian or I think the last
[SPEAKER_00]: time I saw Thai was like 81 or that I knew
for sure was Thai was 81 or 82 when that
[SPEAKER_00]: ship went down off the coast of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it was some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For certain, I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started growing indoors,
a lot of us, because of weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Pacific Northwest has a
zillion wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winters don't get too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summers don't get too hot,
but it's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to grow a Himalayan
variety, wet just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can breed for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can eventually bring out resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the Yeagers, which are the Hindu
cushions that they're growing in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are, you can throw them in
the middle of a swamp and they won't mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the variants off of the White
Widow, what I'm told, and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's true, is that the Brazilian that was
used in making White Widow had come from
[SPEAKER_00]: Goa, which was the Portuguese colony on
the Indian subcontinent, had come in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid 1500s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that was the Brazilian that got
used in making White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've had a lot of White Widows rot,
but I have a friend who had a White Widow
[SPEAKER_00]: that wouldn't rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that sometimes it's just,
you know, we get lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the alleles get shuffled for this
batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try to ask you something.
[SPEAKER_06]: The seeds, the first seeds that you were
using for growing indoors under artificial
[SPEAKER_06]: light, what was the genetics?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it, you know, some land races that you
got from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably were one or two from a tie,
because at that point there really wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot else that was exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had not seen I mean, there was down in
California, but in terms of seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, some ties, and they take
forever, and they end up being herms,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried some Colombians.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, God, there was some phenomenal
Colombians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see some of the mahogany
Colombians we had back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one, ha ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first tiba, or the very first
Colombian I ever smoked was something that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were calling tiba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working in a cannery up in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had sent my godbrother 150 bucks to send
me a brick, which, you know, a brick was
[SPEAKER_00]: about a pound, sometimes a little more,
sometimes a little less, and waited three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes is this itty bitty little candy
box, you know, like a metal exotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: or high-end candy box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in it, there's three freaking ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm waiting for a pound,
and there's three freaking ounces,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I sent him 150 bucks, you know,
and this is like, but it's been three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks since we had any pot in Cold Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Cold Bay?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Sandpoint, in Sandpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, okay, well, I'm not real
happy with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to beat them up when I
go back down to Seattle, but at least I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got some pot to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go up to the bunk house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I roll up, not a big one, not a
pinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's wacky weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're laughing our asses off, all of us,
nonstop for three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look down, and there's an oil-soaked
half a joint left.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my introduction to Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this variety called tiba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I understand, there is
someone who lives up by the bay who has
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing that same tiba since 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't let go of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting ready to offer them a $6,000
light in order to get the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, it will be with,
you know, it'll be with a use contract
[SPEAKER_00]: that says, I can use it for breeding,
but I can't release that itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's self-impure form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm willing to do that as long as I
get to have it for me and friends to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was, let's see, wacky weed
was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a lot of that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hear of anyone finding that in
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horny weed, the weed that you would smoke
with someone that you were close with and
[SPEAKER_00]: you would want to get way, way closer with
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know where those effects
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any real consistent
systematic search for how, and this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of something I'll talk about,
how epigenetic factors influence
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotypic expression in known genotypes
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the name of the formal
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: For everyone else, it's how we grow it
affect the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does how you grow it affect the
effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go at this systematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one point in the course of a very
long discussion with Section Chiefs Booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is now the Deputy Director of the
Diversion Division over at the DEA,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Section Chiefs Booth and Armstrong,
I think Armstrong is still Section Chief
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Diversion Division, which,
by the way, are the people who will be
[SPEAKER_00]: signing the licenses to manufacture for
research purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: For about two weeks, I spent an hour a day
on the phone with them asking them
[SPEAKER_00]: questions because I, while in Puerto Rico,
I had had this idea that I thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a glimmer of maybe this is a way we
can do this legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started asking them questions about
setting up a research collaborative
[SPEAKER_00]: because internationally, the two things
that cannabis can be legally used for are
[SPEAKER_00]: research and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use hemp for industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I started asking them questions,
and like I said, it was about an hour a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, and I'd go, well, if I did this and
this, and those people did that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we did this, would that be okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'd talk a little more,
and I'd run another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another possibility by them, and they'd
say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this goes on for a couple weeks,
and then I say, well, if I did this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that and this and then did these,
could I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of saying no, they said,
you're probably gonna have to talk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I thought, okay, there's three
possible interpretations of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they've been jacking me around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had their fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got something else to do,
so they're gonna go send me to bug someone
[SPEAKER_00]: at the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two was, there's just no way, and I'm
gonna go to the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna wanna talk about it,
and that's another way to end the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, they basically had guided me to
what they wanted to guide me to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they, as being in the position they
were in, they could not say, here's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent those couple weeks going over
it, and what emerged was, that one
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative rule, it's not a law,
one administrative rule needs to change
[SPEAKER_00]: for the following to be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they allow sample distribution centers
to collect an administration fee for
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering their sample in a test,
in a study, the following would be
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A before seed to beyond sold vertically
integrated, multi-state, 280E exempt
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before seed, the cannabis itself all gets
genetically sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients in the research collaborative
program all get full genetic and
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemical workups, so now we've got
pretty good idea of what cannabis we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: What conditions they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the patients that have been
recommended by a doctor who tells them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that this is going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a recommendation, not a
prescription, but according to this
[SPEAKER_00]: relational database of the 47,000 people
who have responded on their apps,
[SPEAKER_00]: 23,000 had your symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those 23,000, 10,000 had this condition
as the underlying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those 10,000, 5,000 were very similar
to you genetically and biochemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on that, this is what you should try
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the bar graph that shows the
dominant, like the 10 dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, 10 dominant, in other words,
all of the different cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene, stiles, flavonoids, other esters,
other alkaloids, that gives a bar graph on
[SPEAKER_00]: every package, every sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would basically be matching like chemo
type to the individual's chemo type as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking for is it compensates
for patient individuation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It becomes very quantifiable and
qualifiable so that it's easy to pass that
[SPEAKER_04]: information on and get people on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: To a program like that with a lot of data
to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets more elaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You base it in universities so that it can
be part of the ongoing educational process
[SPEAKER_00]: and the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to know how all of the different
epigenetic factors affect chemotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: expression, we have to get as many growers
as we can, growing as many different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties as we can, as many different
ways as we can to find the missing pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: that have gone away in 50 years of being
bred away from natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I guarantee this plant has been
more places with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the single most ubiquitous plant
there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The single most ubiquitously cultivated
plant there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been grown at the South Pole in a
closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under a fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's been grown up on the
space station, but every continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is our helper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know about the relationship between
man and plants that Pollock talks about in
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bodany of Desire?
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it's the plants have cultivated
us, so we'll cultivate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, coffee, corn, and there's
one other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can't really do well without us
or wouldn't do nearly as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have lifted us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a symbiotic rather than a
parasitic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to know all the ways we can
grow and all those things that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because someplace in there, is for
instance, I believe, the cure to what my
[SPEAKER_00]: mom died of, ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've successfully provided full ensemble
cannabis extracts to parents who have come
[SPEAKER_00]: back and told me their kids don't have
seizures anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: To cancer patients who tell me their
glioblastoma is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting high, but I get higher on
growing than I do on getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get highest of all on someone being
healed by something I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe adult use is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are self-medicating for undiagnosed
cases of social anxiety disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in support of which I say,
think about how many times the icebreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: when you meet someone new is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start laughing an hour later, your
buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, alcohol to a lesser degree,
but I regard cannabis as the best social
[SPEAKER_00]: lubricant there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we need that because our
society, our world is getting to where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're scared of each other on some levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis takes that away long enough to
go, hey, hello over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of, oh my God, what do you have to
do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've gotten away from the story
already, but when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: the Colombian and you only got three
ounces, what happened to the other 13?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dynamite question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect knowing Kenny that he probably
got four or five and I expected him to
[SPEAKER_00]: pinch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, that was a lot of times
in the old days, that was all you got out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it was that pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always tell someone,
hey, I'm making $2 in a pinch when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing street front lids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a 12 ounce pinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big pinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more like a fistful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm inclined to believe that it was
actually going for that price because when
[SPEAKER_00]: I got back down to Seattle like four
months later, two or three people had
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it was quite as good as that
Chiba, but they were all up in the 40 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: $50 an ounce range, which was like three
or four times what I was used to paying
[SPEAKER_00]: for an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went on those few occasions when I would
have to buy an ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you had your first grow going and
everything and you were getting some,
[SPEAKER_04]: like when were you first harvesting some
of the bud that you were really excited
[SPEAKER_04]: about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited about the little bits
of bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I got the first time I grew outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I can get a harvest, I am excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a bumper crop is preferable,
but even a crop failure, if I get to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: some pot I've grown myself, it's a
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where it's been for money,
it was probably a year into it before I
[SPEAKER_00]: started really seeing it pay for itself
and then get better and better from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the high output fluorescent?
[SPEAKER_00]: VHO, very high output grow lux lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were made by a company called Luxor,
which was located in Raway, New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxor also made something called the Color
Matchers 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I'm a lighting freak,
I got some of those and tried them and
[SPEAKER_00]: found out that these were truly
outstanding lights for rooting clones
[SPEAKER_00]: under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I got them to make, they made a
gross of them for me with a power twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember fluorescents
or ever even saw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're young enough, they might not have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had like a twist because it gave it
more, they had more output because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was more surface area for the light to
come from, but they made them double
[SPEAKER_00]: anode, very high output, power twist for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the most singularly
magnificent cloning lights that I to this
[SPEAKER_00]: day have ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I got done doing my 15 years of
prison, we'll get to that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after I did that, I came out of
prison, Luxor was gone, it had been
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by Ostram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ostram makes a lamp called the Color
Classers 75, which I had really hoped was
[SPEAKER_00]: the, okay, Color Classers 75, that I
really hoped was the Color Matchers 75,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work anywhere near as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color Matchers 75 is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told the folks over at Ostram,
that one of the best things ever that they
[SPEAKER_00]: could do for their company would be start
offering some cloning lights in the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same spectral output as those Color
Matchers 75s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was throwing clothes away that weren't
well-rooted in seven days in plugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the color spectrum that you found
to be so successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was a 7,500 Kelvin color
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, color temperatures are
averages rather than specific blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you can blend this from this
wavelength to this wavelength to this
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength and get the same color
temperature in Kelvins that you do mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I wanted Ostram since they
had bought Luxor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured they probably had the Luxor
files, they had the SPDs, they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would really like to see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, I mean, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a tray of 50 and I would
think I had had a bad run if five didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally by the one week mark,
from that point, because by then I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing Sea of Green, from that point
they're rooted, they get five or ten days
[SPEAKER_00]: of veg, 22 hours a day of veg under a
really lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I found varieties that it worked
really well with, it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first deliberate Sea of Green was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't manage to duplicate those
results for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kept at it and did.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I'm at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How Sea of Green was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over, let's see, I'm growing in a
hanger at Creston Airport, southeast of
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a hanger full of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm three to four weeks from Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a phone call from Puget Electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Siegel, you're using an enormous
amount of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to send one of our staff out to
help you determine if there's some way you
[SPEAKER_00]: could save some electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious case of the old fucks because I
got a hanger full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I went and got a bunch
of U-Haul wardrobe boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were about six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of U-Haul wardrobe boxes and
I double decked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put pots and plants in one and then put
the other one on top as a cover,
[SPEAKER_00]: taped them, and filled a U-Haul truck with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this truck stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were well into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This truck reeked and I'm like,
I really hope I don't get pulled over
[SPEAKER_00]: because where I was taking them was from
just a little southeast of Seattle to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme northeast corner of Washington
State, about 300 miles, 300, 350 miles,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I really hope I didn't get
pulled over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get pulled over, what the fuck am I
going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I came up with was I know it
wouldn't save me, but as a rule of thumb,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're interacting with cops,
if you can make them laugh, if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make them smile, if you can make them
believe that you might be a human being
[SPEAKER_00]: and not filthy, scum, perp, you can
usually get looser handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can usually get not as shittily
treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, well, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll come up with a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I came up with is it's made
everyone I've told about it laugh and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I like to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I came up with was that I would call
it, I would say, officer, I know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think this is, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Himalayan mintweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting, or Himalayan mint vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting ready to sell it as a
novelty item.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our slogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like pot, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have to test that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have to test out if that worked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't have to test it out,
fortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I end up over in Eastern Washington
with this truckload of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At my friend Mike's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are that someone watching this
podcast lives on Kelly Road, up above
[SPEAKER_00]: Davenport, out by Hunters and Espeelum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mike R., you'll know who I mean by
Mike R.
[SPEAKER_00]: because he started all of you growing up
there, was growing and he had planted a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I arrived over there, haven't even
called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a truck full of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can I plant these over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to finish them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, well, I planted a lot of plants,
but yeah, there's probably a few places
[SPEAKER_00]: back there you could still throw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to the door to his trailer was
a little brown one gallon terracotta pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with a 24 inch flower coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid, from maybe an inch, two inches,
above the dirt, all the way up to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: No gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really freaking solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is Eastern Washington,
which is very dry as far as the weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked him about this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, well, I got so busy, I never got
a chance to plant it, but we've kept
[SPEAKER_00]: watering it and it looks kind of cool,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think about it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next year, I was doing a crop in
Seattle along, there's a stretch of
[SPEAKER_00]: railroad that runs along the banks of
Puget Sound, the coast of Puget Sound,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in central, well, not central,
but slightly north of Seattle,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in the northern part of Seattle,
there's a neighborhood called Ballard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it sits on a bluff over Puget Sound
with the railroads running below the bluff
[SPEAKER_00]: and in between the railroads and the road
that goes to a park that if you count each
[SPEAKER_00]: car that goes by and each person in those
car, in the course of a summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably have a quarter of a million
people that go by the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a blackberry patch that runs
along the railroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe 75 to 125 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I love blackberry patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go do the Viet Cong thing in under
the tunnel, pull them all, pull plants
[SPEAKER_00]: under so Brown doesn't show up from above,
put in several pots, put in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel down to the next spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All told, I did about three miles of
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see, all told, I do about three
miles of garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty funky because I've got,
in order to water, I've got to backpack
[SPEAKER_00]: six gallons of water at a time in my
backpack down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting an hour or two before sunset,
right down, excuse me, before sunrise,
[SPEAKER_00]: right down to maybe half an hour,
an hour after sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it starts getting light enough that I
think people can see me, I got to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did get that crop all the way
done, but there was like a dozen,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a dozen and a half plants that I
wasn't able to get down there in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sat in a upside down pallet in
Dixie, in 20 ounce solo cups and Mary,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend's wife, John, my friend and I
watered several times a day to keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: from drying out and damned if I didn't get
some 18 inch long solid flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is all going on right in that era
where I'm starting to grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I noticed looking at
the plants growing indoors is I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: not growing a six foot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing a bunch of leaf and lumber and
I'm growing, I don't know, 18 to 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 inches of plant that's really
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think about shit a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start thinking about that plant in
front of Mike's place, those plants up on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of John's shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grow zone was the term I came up with
of 18 to 30 inches max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, hmm, I wonder what's going to
happen if I do this deliberately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this is going on, I've been
dealing with a company called HydroTech in
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been a customer of Indoor Sun,
Steve Murphy, the guy who wrote those
[SPEAKER_00]: books, but HydroTech's prices were less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were a little more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start doing business with them as a
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kevin, the owner of the company,
likes to talk almost as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time what would happen is I
would come in, Kevin would be talking to a
[SPEAKER_00]: customer, and I would end up waiting on
the customer who came in after me because
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty familiar with his gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to tell people about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up helping them develop it's
like we had the Chinese hat type cones,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cooley hat type cones, or type
reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't very happy with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just didn't seem very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried some pyramid shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried some, let's see, three-sided
pyramids, four-sided pyramids,
[SPEAKER_00]: six-sided paraboloid, and finally ended up
with the eight-sided paraboloids that
[SPEAKER_00]: became the model for all of the
umbrella-style reflectors that came later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first people that copied us
were M&R Lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it in white.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using highly reflective aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of this being that I had one of
the very first seven-foot paraboloids
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging over this and four corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had 2,000 watts of light over
one-gallon pots, round one-gallons,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had 198 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got between a half an ounce and
three-quarters of an ounce of dry flour
[SPEAKER_00]: from each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1982, I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six and a half pounds from 2,000 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 watts of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 water in a seven-foot paraboloid and
four corner reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were actually what we were selling as
horizontal reflectors, four corner
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So horizontal is in the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shining in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe what I had in them was 250-watt
General Electric Corporation, not American
[SPEAKER_00]: GE, but British GE, HPSs, the Ceramalux 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Ceramalux 4 made an appearance
here semi-recently as the Hortilux Ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hortilux is gone now, but that lamp was
the GEC Ceramalux 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the SPDs, very,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of area were you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the corners got taken, so I would say
it was probably closer to 75 square feet
[SPEAKER_00]: than 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been really nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to get going, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have lots of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be well.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you, Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to ask, tell me about Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know Boris Luterbach, who was
setting up a grow there for a while?
[SPEAKER_06]: Boris Luterbach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, high-energy plasma guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Frankfurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but he's Slovenian or is he German?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's German, but he was working with
Germanical on an operation they were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's possible, yeah, because
development companies are quite... There
[SPEAKER_06]: is quite a lot of development companies in
our country, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Small, you know, for any kind of
scientific approach, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I would start to talk about this now,
we would go in different area,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we talk about cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, for cannabis, we have an
institute for cannabinoids, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: An institute for cannabinoid research,
you know, which is like only doctors are
[SPEAKER_06]: there, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are teaching doctors for medical
approach for cannabis, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the future, they will be cannabinoid
clinics and I hope that a lot of medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: staff will be teached in the future for
this development of medicine, which is,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, controlled medicine,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because all of us, you know, all of us
know how to cook their own Rick Simpson
[SPEAKER_06]: oil at home, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the truth is that not everybody should
do that because people work with dangerous
[SPEAKER_06]: substances and, you know, they can burn up
their houses and, you know, stuff like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should actually give it to
professionals who can control,
[SPEAKER_06]: in a controlled environment, do an
extraction of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: On a professional scale, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that, absolutely,
Sasha.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you also developed the light,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said the ones, the hoods that look
like flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on in Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is that a lot of the
German companies, like as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Germanical in particular, has operations
that they're developing there because you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, I guess, have a lot better legal
atmosphere than the Germans do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if we are talking about cannabis
research or cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: in development of what we, because
cannabis is still very much controlled and
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal in Slovenia, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the truth about this also is,
but it will be very soon change the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: The law will be changed very soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even tonight, I think now, in this time,
there is on national TV, there is,
[SPEAKER_06]: they will show a report about it,
that they will put a law into place now
[SPEAKER_06]: that small scale growing will be allowed
for home growers, like German model now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a step to decriminalize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We say decriminalization, not
legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because legality means something else,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a step into the right
direction, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the model of growing, of people
being able to grow for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, at least here in the United
States, and perhaps in Europe as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the path forward for people who want
to grow, one, I think Green Rush is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone is going to get rich
in a year or two growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the people who love ganja,
who want to grow, who like to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the way forward is ready to
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people who really know what
they're doing should grow properly tended
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to the point where they're ready to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we sell them to people to finish
in their own home, so they've got that
[SPEAKER_00]: last stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to deal with bugs coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a plant that they know,
when they bought it, was ready to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and was a clean plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They follow the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a great idea for, so I helped
manage a farm here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had a great idea, if there was
available cannabis tourism, to have people
[SPEAKER_04]: out to the farm showcase 100 to 150
different strains in both outdoor and
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor settings and be able to sell them
the clones of it so that they know what
[SPEAKER_04]: they can look for as the plant flowers out
and give them that sort of interactive
[SPEAKER_04]: experience where they know what to do and
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also have some recourse to be
able to come to those people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: professional growers and get advice on
their home grows so that they can have
[SPEAKER_04]: clean medicine that they made for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern there on the visits is every
time you get any additional visitor is a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential nexus for problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have to be with a lot of security
and scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right on that page with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I would like to do
is offer grow-it-yourself kits with a
[SPEAKER_00]: voucher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take that voucher to a state licensed
nursery to get your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you bought that kit, one of the
things you would be buying would be you
[SPEAKER_00]: can call up who you bought it from 24
hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a helpline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, here's your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, my plant's sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And call someone who's got a Gladwell or
two worth of experience to help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put you in charge of that
technical support, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing 24 hours, 7, technical
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not pensioned enough, but I actually
have about eight people that if that ever
[SPEAKER_00]: happens have said, yeah, they would
consider being a part of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think are at an expertise level
that I could rely on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feel confident that if I was
someone in that position, I could call
[SPEAKER_00]: them and know that the advice I was
getting was valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we need to see more customer
service, more customer education,
[SPEAKER_00]: more consumer education, and we need to
remember where this comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not a CPG to make millionaires
richer with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine if it does that as long as
everyone who needs it gets it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone who wants to grow it can grow
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Bob Marley said, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't be able to make a plant
illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's against any nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot be against nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a contradiction in itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: How can it be that we are against it?
[SPEAKER_06]: We are against it in the last hundred
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the first prohibition was back
around 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the Pashas, one of the
Islamic Pashas, made it a death sentence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is weird because culturally I would
bet Muhammad consumed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go on with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just want to make sure because it's
one of the most, it's one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're acclaimed for is inventing Sea
of Green.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to make sure that we cover that
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to make sure that people know
about your involvement with Send Simulia
[SPEAKER_02]: Tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: After we cover those few things,
if we're rambling a bunch, I'm cool with
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but I just want to make sure we don't
get three, four hours deep and we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: covered your greatest accomplishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this Sea of Green and it was six and
a half pounds and I was like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me over a year before I could get
those same kind of results again.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing after another, mites,
let me see, mites, mites again,
[SPEAKER_00]: rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much, it's almost like when I'm,
when I'm offering consulting services to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone, I like to say everything that
could go wrong I've had happen so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get the benefit of my trial and errors
without having to go through them yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything that could happen did to
keep it from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then about a year later, the job that
was my regular job, which was working in a
[SPEAKER_00]: beer and wine warehouse, sort of fell
apart on me and Kevin, the owner of
[SPEAKER_00]: HydroTech, said, well, why don't you come
work for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been selling gear every time
I was in the store anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're right, I did skip over part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Bjornson was the owner of a company
called HydroTech, which was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two halide slash grow shops in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin had been writing a column in
Sinseamia Tips Magazine called The Farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Sky for, I think he'd written it,
let's see, I think he wrote in spring 82
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think he wrote the fall 82 one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then winter 82, I started writing with
Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote The Farmer in the Sky column from
1982 until operation green, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, until winter 88 edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinseamia Tips itself, the full name is
Sinseamia Tips Domestic Growers Journal,
[SPEAKER_00]: for those who don't know, was the online
growers forum before there was an online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinseamia Tips was what High Times would
have liked to be because it was all about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't off into other, it wasn't off
into how to freebase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't off into selling gear for
freebasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was strictly about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did High Times talk about freebasing and
how to freebase?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that might have been something
that was earlier in the 80s, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take a look at High Times from about
19, well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the early, the very last part
of the 70s, early part of the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even the mid 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, it's like they became a
lifestyle magazine and it was just all
[SPEAKER_00]: drug lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling pseudoephedrine pills on
the inside back cover for people to make
[SPEAKER_00]: meth from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sell as counterfeits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of lost their way for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that Steve Hagar probably saved
that magazine by bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Green Merchant happened,
they gave them free reign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that Steve Hagar is why High
Times survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was never the Grow magazine that
Sinseamia Tips was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Alexander, the publisher of Sinse tips
had balls bigger than a fucking blue
[SPEAKER_00]: whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on national television with zero
tolerance happening and debate
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization with the DEA agent on
Geraldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which if you don't know who Geraldo was,
he was a very popular moderator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a show called Nightline I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it was just a Geraldo Rivera
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was called the Geraldo Rivera
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell the story because this is
something that I'm not familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Alexander, excuse me, Tom Alexander
went on the Geraldo Rivera show and
debated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and debated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's something that we can
still find online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bet you probably could on the
archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're friends with Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom might have a copy of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to have Tom come on the
show, but please tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about Tom debating Geraldo Rivera because
that sounds like a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean basically it was just Tom was
presenting common logic and the DEA guy
[SPEAKER_00]: was presenting anti-pot hysteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as bad as when the DEA agent or when
the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Agents testified that when he tried
marijuana he turned into an owl and flew
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He flew around the room, but that was
actually testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: A DEA agent said this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was talking about cannabis,
not LSD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he was a little confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm talking about, BNDD comes in and
DEA replaces BNDD and three or four other
[SPEAKER_00]: federal agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BNDD was DEA before DEA was DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a BNDD agent who said he tried it
and he turned into an owl and flew around
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, if that would work, I would love
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to be an owl.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to fly?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the old pot commercial where you
melt into the couch and you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: where can I find that weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had pot like that in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've never turned into an owl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never turned into an owl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I melted through a wall on LSD once,
but who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beatles movie Let It Be was world
trialed for the first time in 1971.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get made for three or four more
years, but they did it at Carver
[SPEAKER_00]: Auditorium and I melted through the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ended up inside the concert and my
last conscious memory was, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can get my molecules to vibrate at
the same rate as the wall, I can pass
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I got there, but I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, going back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a sense of melliotips.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kevin writes for a sense of melliotips
and when I start going in as a customer,
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually, even before I got hired,
I'm helping him edit what he's doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: helping him not put some ridiculous shit
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one issue where he said,
if someone's knocking at your door and
[SPEAKER_00]: they claim they're the police,
hold a gun on them until they show you
[SPEAKER_00]: their warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got him to take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what the effects of that would
have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A genius, but not always totally logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sensible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we start writing together and we
worked well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the farmer in the sky, we introduced
the world to the concept of sealed room
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a little while before they came up
with many splits that made real sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: room growing possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The through the wall air conditioners,
he always lost some.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an article that you wrote on
sealed room growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it would be probably the fall
issue, fall 85 issue, because what got me
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about it was I went down to the
national normal conference in DC in 85 and
[SPEAKER_00]: there were three vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was me trying to introduce Growing
Indoors for Fun and Profit, Kevin and I's
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when I met Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there to introduce The Emperor
Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: His book did a little better than ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey Julian DiMarco was there to show
the Phototron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the Phototron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was totally unimpressed with the
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the execution left a lot to be
desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constant, fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the light the plant can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steadily delivering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it on room size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd already done that, but not to the
extent that, okay, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reasonably sure it was the fall or
winter 85 issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a full collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you an index of every Farmer in
the Sky article or column and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: subjects were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to steal the light for a second,
but I wrote for the Growing Edge magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote an article that I titled To Vent
or Not To Vent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was being done because at the
time they were growing in the space
[SPEAKER_02]: station.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, you know, you can't grow in
the space station and vent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started growing sealed root environment
at that time, but I'd never read about it
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere being done in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm getting my reality check that over
15 years earlier you were discussing it
[SPEAKER_02]: with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize just how much Green
Merchant knocked all of the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some of it went to Holland,
but I was starting to talk about things we
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced as the Farmer in the Sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time we wrote about Sea of Green was
as the Farmer in the Sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time when we came up with a device
that would prevent you from adding CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: from tanks or burners while you were
venting or venting while you were adding
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a relay switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was neck and neck.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's on, this one's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Us and Green Air were neck and neck on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure we were first,
but they might have been a little ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure we were first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote about something called Organic
Hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had never heard the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays it's called Aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first article offering a practical way
to supplement UV appears in the February
[SPEAKER_00]: 1986 issue of High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Author, Farmer in the Sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first paraboloid, not true paraboloid
because it actually spreads out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more at the bottom to get more width.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up with, I think we had the first
one in 82 or 83.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then POOT, who now do businesses,
PL Lighting swooped in and took that same
[SPEAKER_00]: shape for the inside of their reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put housing on the outside,
but that shape they then swooped in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next people that were doing it in
our industry was Sunlight Supply or M&R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Diamond Lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the paraboloids, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamond was still using cones at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, Steve Murphy was the
first one selling halides and sodiums into
[SPEAKER_00]: what came to be called the hydroponic
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always made me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bothered me that back before Yair and I
started getting along, it bothered me that
[SPEAKER_00]: he would refer to what we do as
hydroponics and what they were selling
[SPEAKER_00]: into as agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if what we weren't wasn't an
agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get along really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got me out of a mess a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, paraboloid reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The salt mix that eventually got used in
the first dedicated ceramic metal halides
[SPEAKER_00]: was what was originally in the Osram
OptiMark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first one, as far as I know,
to use it for growing cannabis under.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the lamp I mentioned earlier,
the British GE Ultra High Pressure Sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: Slash Hortilux Ceramic High Pressure
Sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hortilux is another one of the Sinsemea
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've said, and you'll hear me say it
again because I repeat myself a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a pot geek and a lighting freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to stand around reading lighting
engineering bulletins to keep myself
[SPEAKER_00]: entertained between customers coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I'm reading this bulletin and here
is a lamp that I can run off a halide
[SPEAKER_00]: ballast, but it's a sodium lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: No big deal nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then you had halide ballasts,
sodium ballasts, halide sockets,
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium sockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out, I'll start a little ways
into it, halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then later it was halides followed by
sodiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was halides and sodiums at the
same time adding more sodium during flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe pulling halides out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the very end of HID, people
started putting halides in each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again for the last two weeks to get the
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these used to have their own,
like I said, sodium or halide and you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually they made a switchable ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it just brought an igniter into
the circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point we didn't have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't dual ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here was this lamp that I knew I could
sell a zillion of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it worked as well as a standard sodium
and I could screw it onto a halide socket,
[SPEAKER_00]: run it on a halide ballast, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LA people didn't want, they would sell
us lamps of types they already had,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they didn't want to order a new lamp
in for our market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew who we were selling to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they could pretend they weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it was just because the
market was small?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be because it was just a
very small market at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was because it was
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you think about how many
lights they were selling to the street
[SPEAKER_02]: light market and to all the other stuff,
cannabis at this point was still just a
[SPEAKER_02]: very small part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still, I tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I got the LA wholesaler who had sent
me the bulletin to carry these lamps was a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend of mine, I asked around among my
friends, and turned out I knew someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: is familiar with kanji, which is the
formal Japanese writing style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would write letters, have him translate
them, and we sent them to the parent
[SPEAKER_00]: company, which was Iwasaki, who now are
I-Ace in some parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I finally got them to send the LA
distributor a six pack of these lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took six months to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tried them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaking loved them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a sodium, except I could run
them on allies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really, really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started asking, well, does Iwasaki
make allies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make regular sodiums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're selling a bunch of Iwasakis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That original conversion lamp was called
the Iwasaki I-Ace 940.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 940 watts, not 1,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing with this light,
though, is that you could basically just
[SPEAKER_04]: swap the bulb out, rather than having to
pull the whole fixture down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they also make a 360?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they made one like that,
too, I believe, later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like to fit in a 400 watt fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people started buying these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it never picked up quite like the
I-Ace 940 while I was still in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went away for 15 years in 1989.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I come back, there's a new
company selling lights, selling lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their name is Hortilux.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how Hortilux entered horticultural
lighting for the first time in their
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate history.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hadn't even been selling their
standard lamps into horticulture prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was disappointed to see them go a
couple years ago, because I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: heart attachment to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, I think their daylight blue halide
was vastly underrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought Hortilux into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduced, looking at molasses,
I went, well, if that works so well,
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't completely raw evaporated cane
juice work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not any heat, just the original
basically plant blood, dry plant blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrote about that as a rejuvenant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people still don't know about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kicks ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix it with a little bit of vitamin
B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a phenomenal rejuvenant for
recovering from, say, you had bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back from it really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said vitamin B1 and cane sugar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaporated cane juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like turbinado, but actually
evaporated, sun evaporated cane juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know now that what it does,
you're not feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're doing is you're supercharging
the feeding that you're giving your
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're feeding your soil really well,
just as a way to up it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote about what would become called
aquaponics as organic hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrote about, we wrote as Esperanza
Godot, we wrote, and I love this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wrote an errata page for the anarchist
cookbook, because anyone using the
[SPEAKER_00]: anarchist cookbook recipes had a really
good chance of blowing themselves to hell,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were a lot of, we think it
might have been deliberate disinformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we corrected it and put out an errata
on that as Esperanza Godot, just to warn
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the others?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea of Green, Plantlet, we were the first
ones to put that name on that style of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I ever saw a method and the
method was around before the name was,
[SPEAKER_00]: called perpetual harvest, was when we put
that name on it in the column.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that would be 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always remember all this stuff later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoods, lamps, feeding method.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talked about Sea of Green,
but you didn't talk about Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrog comes later.
[SPEAKER_00]: On October 26th of 1989, the warrants,
the indictments in phase one of Operation
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Merchant are unsealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bust 63 grow shops in 48 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They arrest 200 and some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person arrested for the highest plant
count in phase one of Operation Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Merchant was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was originally indicted for 12,000 plus
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, they let me plead down to only
3,999.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 4,000, I was looking at a mandatory
minimum 10 year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 10,000, a mandatory minimum 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were pretty ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what had happened is in 2017,
they had changed the sentencing guidelines
[SPEAKER_00]: for cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant, for purposes of sentencing,
was regarded as a kilo as of November
[SPEAKER_00]: 17th, 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, it was 100 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I got for pleading guilty was a
reduction of what I was indicted for,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,999 instead of over 4,000 or over
10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Date of offense, this was the big one,
was stipulated as having occurred prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: November 17th, 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like, oh cool, so I got
sentenced for a tenth less of a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it needs a little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had busted someone in Alaska who had
some receipts in their trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those receipts had my thumb print on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things on that receipt was
a signed statement that they understood
[SPEAKER_00]: that no information nor technology
obtained from HydroTech was ever to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for any illegal purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was lawyers advice put this,
it's the same as when someone orders a
[SPEAKER_00]: knife through the mail, you have to say,
no, yes, I'm over 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had done everything we could and we
had signs up in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use anything for illegal purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I knew I was gonna have to plead
guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do bounce around a little with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I was gonna have to plead guilty
because the number one witness against me
[SPEAKER_00]: said that I was conspiring with them at
the Pink Flamingos Ringo Hotel in
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast Portland on December 23rd,
1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like pretty certain as to the date
and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, during the omnibus hearing,
which is the evidence hearing when a judge
[SPEAKER_00]: decides if evidence is or isn't going to
be allowed, we presented the traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: write-up from my having an accident in
Kailua Kona in the evening on 22 December,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: We presented the hotel records showing me
checking out of the hotel the morning of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 23rd of December, 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed phone records made from the
airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was on the Big Island,
so I flew over to the Big Island and sat
[SPEAKER_00]: in the airport in Honolulu for a couple
hours, made phone calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showed the phone records.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judge ruled it was a reliable witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 3,000 and some miles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can prove it at the specific time and date
that this guy says I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judge ruled, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, I knew I was gonna be
doing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told my lawyer, find out what's the
absolute least I can get without giving
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raised a particular way,
and I believe firmly that you ride your
[SPEAKER_00]: beef alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get busted, you don't take anyone
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone's more than welcome to go back,
look at the records involving my arrest
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find no one else got indicted out
of my incidents, et cetera, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty clear that if you
would have ratted people out, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have spent, what was it, 15 years in jail?
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 total, actually a little over 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do need to clarify that this was in
two pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first piece was the six-year bit
arising directly out of Operation Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Merchant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got out, someone who had owed
me money gave me stories for six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: laughed in my face about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got very upset and ended up catching a
new beef that I never would have if I
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't gone away on Green Merchant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a nice beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people that my 15 years arose from
Green Merchant because they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine of them was for the guy laughing at
me about owing me money after I held my
[SPEAKER_00]: mud and he didn't go to prison because I
held my mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lot nicer now than I was,
but when he laughed at me, I put a 45 in
[SPEAKER_00]: his mouth and he explained to him how much
smarter it would be to get right with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He managed to find the money right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also called the cops and I caught
kidnapping and armed robbery, beefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That never would have happened if I had
not gone to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It arose from Green Merchant.
[SPEAKER_00]: $75,000 is a lot of money to someone
that's been away for six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it in perspective too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six years for growing cannabis,
nine years for putting a gun in somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't seem like a proper balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I could see you doing more time
for putting a gun in somebody's mouth,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you shouldn't have spent a day in
prison for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and I never would have done the
second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it is, I need to also explain,
I had never touched speed in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was around, in large measure,
a bunch of crooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that make meth while I was in
prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was seeing them at their best,
not their worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up with a mild meth habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was toward the end of that that I went
to collect and just finally it had enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I shouldn't have had
those nine years for what I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I never would have done it if I hadn't
gone to prison in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prison, no matter how good a person you
are, takes something away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your values change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rough rule of thumb, I know that
phrase is no longer PC, but tough shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general principle is that for every
year of prison you do, it takes a year to
[SPEAKER_00]: deinstitutionalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky, certain effects probably
never go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and your record never goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consequences never go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this is a piece of why I'm
not thrilled with legalization as it
[SPEAKER_00]: exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most states, because of my criminal
record, in most legal states, I cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: hold a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states only go back ten years when
they look at the records.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 28 years since my last felony
conviction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's because of your cannabis
record or because of the kidnapping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most states specifically include cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the states make an exception for
if all of your crimes would now be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even there, they left themselves wiggle
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things tighten down again,
as I believe they will over the next four
[SPEAKER_00]: years, I think we're really going to be
missing what the last few years have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the political clout and where it
is is not really very pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's money there, so maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope and pray that people are going to
be able to keep making a decent living in
[SPEAKER_00]: the contiguous 48 and up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I honestly believe if you want to make
a decent living growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these two places, you're going to
artisanal grow for high-end market with
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get the rep for having, this is the
best of this there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like this kind, get it from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it costs more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing would be, and this is
probably the main route I hope to take,
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing ready-to-flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to sell people grow gear,
sell them the plants to grow with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hold their hand until they tell me,
look, I've got it, go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sign up for that 24-hour
technical support.
[SPEAKER_00]: What shift do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, meaning I'm going to call you
when I need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you know, that can be there
too, but you're knowledgeable enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be more inclined to put you on the
answering end than the questioning end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ready-to-flowers, selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting up, getting the research
collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reminds me, I never finished telling
you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this would work is the farmers
become vendors to the license holders,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to be a vendor on a license where
you're manufacturing a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: substance for research, you're going to
have to be compliant with their security
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the model we're more likely to
see would be industrial parks,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are collectively owned by the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also puts, there is a way there
to monetize and go around 280E,
[SPEAKER_00]: but medical, with that rule gone,
become, and when it's under a DEA license,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not subject to 280E.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're two hours in, but I know
Wolf hasn't even scraped the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want apologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finishing the collaborative, you go in,
your doctor has recommended you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been physically worked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what your physical type is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on record what your condition is,
what the primary symptoms you're seeking
[SPEAKER_00]: relief from are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your doctor says, well, according to the
relational database, this is what people
[SPEAKER_00]: having your makeup, your condition are
saying has the best results for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be where you might want to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to a sample distribution point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give them the fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember I said this is the one rule that
has to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give them the fee for what they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you your package, and you've
become, in order to do this, you've agreed
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill out, to answer on a mobile app,
20 questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all circle and check type
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: No complicated essay type questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already know what your conditions
are, what your physical makeup is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you talk about how this has worked for
your conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those results go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we've got 30, 40, 50,000 of these
answers, and you have to do this if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to re-up, you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have filled out the
questionnaire to be able to get more.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things this will let people do
is say I'm in Portland, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I buy White Widow, and this White
Widow is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff makes my back stop hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything seems a little funnier than it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the old lady and I are getting along
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a week later, I'm out of White
Widow, and I'm in Portland, Maine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I walk into the dispensary in
Portland, Maine, and I hand them the
[SPEAKER_00]: package with the bar graph on it,
or the thing that gets you to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't even have to be on the package
with these new, the QR things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You show them the QR that's on the
package, they go, and you might say
[SPEAKER_00]: something like, I need some White Widow,
and they take it, and they go,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we have that same profile at half
the strength, so you'll have to use about
[SPEAKER_00]: twice as much, and this is called Purple
Umogumo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, regardless of what technique the
farmer used to grow, regardless of what he
[SPEAKER_00]: fed it, regardless of what it was called
at that other place, you now have the
[SPEAKER_00]: medication that you know from personal
experience has benefited you with your
[SPEAKER_00]: specific condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the Storm Crow's list on steroids.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many points of data, like,
have you seen workwires to make this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking, I am the world's best
thinker, one of the world's best thinker
[SPEAKER_00]: uppers of great ideas, and one of the
world's worst finders of funders that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're ever gonna meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seriously, at one point,
we would have, at one point, had what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was trying to do work, six different
people said they'd put the second million
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna buy the town of Tiller,
Oregon, and turn it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-centered resort town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been the Tiller Homestead
community, because Tiller had at one time
[SPEAKER_00]: been in Homestead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Government would have been by all of the
adults in the community, once a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: by phone, by computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have been the community board
of directors, so THC would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: governed by, would have been regulated by
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the town would have included the
American College of Cannabiculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have included the Dr. Todd Hiro
Mikioria Center for Integrative Healing
[SPEAKER_00]: and Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of a number of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This research collaborative needs backing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it needs is for, really, I hate to
say it, a pharmaceutical company to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanna do stuff with cannabis,
but we don't even know where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up with these, what I'm gonna call,
I wish I could claim this, but it's not my
[SPEAKER_00]: portmanteau, coming up with anic data to
support where they should begin
[SPEAKER_00]: subclinical or clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, medical cannabis is us
standing on the edge of a cliff
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooking the Grand Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pitch black night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're blindfolded, and there's a hood over
the top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shooting off a shotgun, and we're
hoping that in the morning, when we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom, we're gonna find something
that we can eat for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of research collaborative I'm
talking about, realistically, would take a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of decades off the research that's
gonna need to be done to find all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: places cannabis can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, I don't have letters after my
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a wonderful thing to
have, especially with the lack of research
[SPEAKER_04]: just due to the criminalization over years
and the limitation of, what is it,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Mississippi State that was able to do
any research whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mahmoud El Soli's plantation down
there at Parchman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even that, they were working with
cultivars that were out of date for a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time, and they weren't really upgrading
any of the applicable knowledge that was
[SPEAKER_04]: being developed by the community
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's so much data that's just either
lost to minds like yours, where you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a PhD or an MD after your name,
where people are gonna be listening to you
[SPEAKER_04]: in a more intent fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounds like something that would
help, though, is a community effort
[SPEAKER_04]: towards more refined research techniques
that are able to be published in a way
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be accepted overall by the
medical or scientific or general public in
[SPEAKER_04]: a positive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about the collaborative proposal
that I believe is strong at this point is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually, strictly speaking,
not a clinical or subclinical study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not subject to the same rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an organized collection of
anic data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's anecdotes, we're relaying,
this is what a statistically significant
[SPEAKER_00]: sample population reports is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: This becomes a real thing for a college to
get money from a pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say, at one point,
this was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big hurricane in 2016 hit
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have great family connections in Puerto
Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather, Senor Wolf, is the man
who's considered to have begun the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement to save old San Juan.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he died, the governor read his eulogy
while they scattered his ashes over the
[SPEAKER_00]: harbor from El Morro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was down there to talk to some people
about lights, and on the 39th floor of my
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel, and I get a call from the desk,
Senor Siegel, someone here wishes to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my life, a call like that generally
means either there's a cop waiting for me
[SPEAKER_00]: or there's someone who's not very happy
about my relationship with his old lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, not who I want to run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm on the 39th floor of a hotel,
and the only way out is elevators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go, OK, let's go see what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to the bottom, and here is a
stereotype chauffeur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jodhpur, you know, the tucked-in boots,
the double-breasted jacket, the hat under
[SPEAKER_00]: the arm, the whole nine yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you are Senor Siegel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, La Dona wishes you to join
her for lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I know a little bit about Puerto
Rican society.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big German migration at the
turn of the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: The social elite in Puerto Rico are mostly
descended from Germans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are all Puerto Ricanos and Puerto
Ricanos, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, La Dona is this little old lady who
is sort of the head, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would be the queen if Puerto Rico had
a queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know who La Dona is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm familiar a little bit with
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I say, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, and I have lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I hear is that Sarita,
my auntie Sarah, was one of La Dona's
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite people when my auntie lived in
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, my auntie was the only purely
non-Puerto Rican that made it anywhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Puerto Rican art museum hierarchy,
because she was one of La Dona's
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so La Dona asked what I'm doing in
Puerto Rico, and I tell her.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, I had lunch with the
governor's executive assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day after that, I had lunch with the
deans of the med, law, and ag schools,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the head of their technology transfer
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sort of had a pretty good thing
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come back to California to the
billionaire who owned the company that was
[SPEAKER_00]: making the lights that I had helped
design, that I was down there to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell him about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meanwhile, the DEA issued a
clarification memo that basically said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't care if it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all THC analogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to prosecute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this billionaire is an East Indian
fellow who the thing over Enron here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California had cost him $23 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hadn't had any criminal proceedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had avoided civil proceedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had cost him $23 million to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, no, no, no, I'm not putting my
money into anything that's directly to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first financier that went
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had he said yes, we would all now be eight
years into this having happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked with probably a dozen wealthy
people about this, people who are into
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal, people who have large
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked with Watson a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see things tighten
down a lot, maybe even back to just purely
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know how to tell people how to
make money anyways if that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, we could get that
research done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if the Republicans tighten
shit down like that, it's OK with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: University of California or a European
university system, any place with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions, their chemical department,
they should have grad students doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical analysis, not for profit,
for experience, for skill, for research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a question, Sasha?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to add to this that I know that
in Israel, for example, there is a very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very advanced, in Israel, right,
there is a very advanced medical system
[SPEAKER_06]: which is working with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with how Israel is doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked with Daddy Mayuri quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they aren't doing random, they're are
doing samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a well-developed medical system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they aren't doing the kind of data
collection that's the only way that given
[SPEAKER_00]: poly molecule, multi molecule medicinal
things, it's hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so much patient individuation
even with isomolecules, with single
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about something where
the ensemble effect, I hate the word
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage used there, the ensemble effect
we need to know this, this, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this work for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got, I have this substance,
here are patients who have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to work for this condition
for people who have this set of genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in this clinic, you know,
where there is a cannabinoid clinic,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they, for example, have this
protocol where the patient that comes
[SPEAKER_06]: inside of the clinic is presented by 20
or, I don't know, 15 samples of different
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis flowers at first.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's touching it and smelling it and he
can touch and smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first contact.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, normally you have to understand
that patients come into the clinic and
[SPEAKER_06]: they've never seen cannabis before in
their lives, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they see cannabis for the first time in
their life.
[SPEAKER_06]: They touch it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And based on their decision, which one is
suiting them best, the whole medicine is
[SPEAKER_06]: in behind already made.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we have everything behind,
you know, all the tinctures, all the
[SPEAKER_06]: isolate, all the different kind of oils,
different kind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they, and they realize that
each person reacts differently,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, for also for the same sickness
they have, you know, for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: some man has cancer in, you know,
the cancer prostata, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and he chooses prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he chooses different than other that
also have prostate cancer, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's because the patient is like
turned on by the sheer information that is
[SPEAKER_06]: on the plant material, you know,
and this is what you talked before.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the volatiles, the terpenes,
the alcohols and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that, that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the whole medicine is already
made because this is standardized product.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the clone for that particular
strain there that they are showing them,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, so all the system is already
made for that and they have good results,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that it doesn't reach to the
same extent that there's distinct patient
[SPEAKER_00]: individuation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people with an identical disease can
need different medications to achieve the
[SPEAKER_00]: same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that we can find all of
what's needed is by thousands of sources
[SPEAKER_00]: and varieties going to tens of thousands
of patients so that we can find the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: range because it is multi-molecular rather
than isomolecular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to both account for patient
individuation and the multi-molecularity
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, we, we really have to, this is,
that's why I'm saying you start out with
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctor saying, according to the
database, people with your makeup,
[SPEAKER_00]: people with your condition are reporting
this one seems to be what they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this one doesn't do it,
then this is the group that the second
[SPEAKER_00]: largest group with your condition report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we fine tune it, as we get tens or
hundreds of thousands of results,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will get to the point where we can say,
okay, you have AB 97365 at this locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, this is what you need,
but that's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without really enormous efforts to collect
that huge, that almost infinite,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so large that it's for all
practical purposes, infinite number of
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of substances and patients
make patient physiologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like the process of elimination
that would go on there is immense after
[SPEAKER_04]: you have those first test samples and you
start with the, hey, start here and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll work our way from there because you
can almost start to then compare those
[SPEAKER_04]: different cannabinoid, terpene,
other oleofactor profiles to each other
[SPEAKER_04]: and then start to drop out the ones that
don't overlap and then pick up the other
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see how fast that could eventually
work to be able to create very unique
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid and endocannabinoid compatible
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and in doing that, figuring out how
to grow them because we're starting out
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what this cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be very close in profile to
this other one that you tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked pretty well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to try this?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has reported on this one yet,
but it's very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this work as well or not as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get there, but it requires that
they let us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: One story that I wanted to make sure that
you told that I don't think that you
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't yet was how you were the last
person to smoke cannabis with Jack
[SPEAKER_02]: Carrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack and I met at the 1985 National Normal
Conference in Washington and we hit it off
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ironic that we met there because both
of us were living in Portland at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this mutual friend, Paul Stanford,
who used to have and run the Hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul is one of the most active hemp
activists in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a pretty good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all activists are growers,
not all growers are activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack is there to introduce the Emperor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there to introduce Growing Indoors for
Fun and Profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start talking and we begin having what
would turn out to be a 24-year-long really
[SPEAKER_00]: fun argument with him saying that the
burning bush was the Ammonia muscaria
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me saying that the burning bush was
actually a burning bush cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good debate to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continued this debate at conferences,
at festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time that Jack and I were at
festivals together and he would be tired
[SPEAKER_00]: of being hero worshipped, we would go
someplace and just get high and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our relationship for 24 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it happens, I was very involved with
Hempstock, which was Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon's version of HempFest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempstock was put on by the Hemp and
Cannabis Foundation for its first five
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first year I was one of the bands,
but after that for the next six years,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years, I was part of the hierarchy,
the core staff, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, Jack came to speak at Hempstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came down off stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave the healthiest, most coherent
speech he had given since his stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart was singing to see my friend
doing so well after being so messed up
[SPEAKER_00]: from the stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gone most of his stroke years,
but to see him doing so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey Jack, let's smoke some pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this vaporizer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a volcano plugged into a really long
extension cord back in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 150 foot extension cord to run my
volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this bag of vape and Jack starts
coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never prior to then really
understood what a paroxysm of coughing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're freaking dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn beet freaking red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gasping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Jack, Jack, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was really worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I said was, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally made you cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He laughs and says, no, I cough all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bag was a good size vape bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bag runs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget why I wandered off from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack has wandered off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill another bag and go looking for
someone else to vape with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people standing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's videoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look and Jack is on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I do is I take the camera
away from the guy that's videoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, no, you don't get to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have your camera back after Jack's
been taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it was inappropriate to be filming
him having a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 45 minutes later an ambulance
arrives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were out at Kelly Point, which is quite
a ways from downtown Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 45 minutes later an ambulance
arrives and they take Jack to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the festival doesn't stop,
but I felt that as a member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hierarchy that someone needed to be at the
hospital for Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's personal assistant, a guy named
Chuck, myself, and I forget the lady's
[SPEAKER_00]: name, waited in the parking lot at the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck didn't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was waiting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: About five o'clock in the morning I left,
checked on how he was when I woke up,
[SPEAKER_00]: went back because I had work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do out at the festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the last time I saw Jack,
but that was also from everything I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been told, the last time Jack ever
consciously consumed cannabis with anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variety, which had been called PDX
Lollipop when going for me, became Jack's
[SPEAKER_00]: Journey because it did eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gabby, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, we don't think that that cannabis
was what caused his heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: What caused his heart attack was he
actually, no, I've got to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you consume cannabis, immediately
afterwards there is a spike in heart rate
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's mellower, but there is a
spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's unlikely that it was that because
from what I've, I mean, I looked into it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want my pot to have killed Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, that's sort of a
horrible claim to end up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out he had been up partying
all the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lady who was waiting in the parking
lot had been his company that evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was maybe a little worn out already
and may or may not have consumed some
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, no, it wasn't pot that killed him,
but the last pot that I know of that he
[SPEAKER_00]: consciously consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've asked family members of his.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know his son, Mark, pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I know, I was the last
person that ever consumed cannabis with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack or that Jack ever consciously
consumed cannabis with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that story, I think it might be a
good thing or a good place to start to
[SPEAKER_02]: wrap it up because I think that's a great
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want to do is tell you that,
you know, I know we stayed away from
[SPEAKER_02]: getting too technical about lighting
science and, you know, other technical
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that you can discuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to invite you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this time we talk mostly about your
story and your stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next time we can talk more about,
you know, different growing methods and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and about lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can sprinkle in some of your
stories with those, you know, because we
[SPEAKER_02]: know you got some stories still to tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called Grandma's Peach
Pie that right now is my absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm told it peach rings cross granddaddy
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tops itself into each branch goes up
and becomes three branches outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes pre floral outside on on the first
time I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fully into pre flower on the twenty
first of July outside and fully into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower by the first of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go into flower, but then has a nice if
you want it, basically it will flower as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you want, like a haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing before we let you go,
is the farmer in the sky?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that's still available?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there any other thing that you want
to discuss as far as like?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that you're doing, you know,
make sure anyone out there if anyone out
[SPEAKER_00]: there wants to see the American consumer
in the American College of Cannabiculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canada Summers Research Institute
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would happen up in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a place up there I can get into
for a down payment of one hundred to two
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred thousand dollars and the owner
will carry contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm willing to sell good sized chunk of
equity for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be advancing the state of
cannabis because we will be doing research
[SPEAKER_00]: we will be a real vocational college
teaching people what they need to know to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cannabis properly for medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all use, you know, I do believe
all use is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make you feel better?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the definition of medicinal and all
cannabis meets that definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm looking forward to us doing
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think we're going to have to do
at least a few more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you also want to talk about
cannabis activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so there's a ton that we
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure that we had
enough time to tell your story and to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: some stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but like I said, next time we'll get
more in depth into lighting science.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make people's heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of just really quickly,
as far as both books goes, I am currently
[SPEAKER_00]: working on what will be I think probably
my last book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called How to Grow Wiser,
a cultivator's handbook for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is all about maximizing yields
while minimizing eco damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just it's full of little stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is like most of the most
important discoveries in growing have been
[SPEAKER_00]: well does things that are there just
really easy to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one seems to notice them until
someone goes, hey, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everyone else goes, well,
duh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't get mentioned until that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just going to put it on the
record here right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm betting it's not the last book you
publish or your last literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just knowing who you are a little bit,
I know you're going to realize you got
[SPEAKER_02]: more to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I should rephrase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last my last growing book, I'm also
working on my autobiography, the title of
[SPEAKER_00]: which is If You Don't Like My Roller
Coaster, Jump.
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty, Wolf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I really appreciate you joining us
for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I want to say is before I
let you go, a few months ago or actually
[SPEAKER_02]: was actually a few years ago at this
point, I got called an OG for the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time and it was by Capulet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, huh, you know,
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You and the people that you were around
back in the day, you're the real OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why that's why I never thought
of myself as an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I always knew about the people
that, you know, came before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I break it out into classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cohorts, anyone that grew before 1970,
like 1970 or before, whether they were
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the United States or an indigenous
grower elsewhere, that's a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: First wave is the people who are growing
prior to a lot of books coming out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would call that starting the age of
indoor growing, even though it really
[SPEAKER_00]: started a little before Steve Murphy's
first book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call those people from then until Green
Merchant, those are second wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, until Green Merchant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until Green Merchant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came right after Green Merchant.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 to 79, 79 to 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then third wave are still OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who grew before it was legal is an
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They earned that right to think they
risked their freedom to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They earned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they weren't major league or like
that, if you risk your freedom to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you are an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Wolf Siegel just called me an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I met you through our friend
through the garden spout up in Seattle,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, up in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you told me he's doing
frisbee golf now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet my friend Ralph Rafael Martinez and
he are buddies because that's Ralph's big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is frisbee golf and he's in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee golf and weed is a good
combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll leave it with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hang up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to stay right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I'm done recording, I'm going to
stop the recording, but we got to stay on
[SPEAKER_02]: the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks, everyone, for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to doing more podcast with
Michael Wolf Siegel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the two wolves here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got two wolves in a hobbit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a book right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.
