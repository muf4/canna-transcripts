[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is Russ Patton,
or better known as Spartan Grown on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cannabis educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an activist and a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a member of the Grandmaster LED
team and one of the founders and operators
[SPEAKER_00]: of the small batch cannabis production
operation, the Tri-Comb Forge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a co-host of the Growing with My
Fellow Growers show on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Michigan Bros Grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I missing anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are just all over the place,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Les B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds show I do every Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Les B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we missed any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a part of other shows in the
past, but they're not running anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I love doing the shows and just
talking about cannabis spreading the good
[SPEAKER_01]: word about its healing properties and just
the power it gives you to be able to home
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big proponent of home grow,
home grow rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a little bit of activism as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak at the Capitol yearly now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, I just think it's an
important fight to get behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything that you've talked
about on the different shows that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been a part about, I'm always like,
hell yeah, Spartan, get out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: fight the good fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm a huge, huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely really happy that you're
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, of course, your host, Nick Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at Mr. Wolf grows on Instagram and
Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's new in your grow world,
Spartan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what have you been doing lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been getting into?
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing for me, the biggest
change is probably working, being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with Grandmaster LEDs affords me to
have like the latest tech and to play with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few of the biggest things for me was
spectrum tuning, playing with the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to change the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of staying with one, you know,
the argument always was what's the best
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, but now it's more like,
why do you have to have one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't you give a veg the best spectrum
in veg and then the best spectrum at
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever stage of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't you do that with one light?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to see that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still playing with that to see,
you know, for example, blue light,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the 450, 440 nanometer blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know in veg to keep the plant,
the inter node spacing tight and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wow, if you throw it in at the very
beginning of flower, you can really
[SPEAKER_01]: suppress the stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you can take and throw it in
towards the end of flower when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting close to harvest and it can help
produce higher cannabinoids, push higher
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the whole trick back in
the HPS days when people were doing HPS
[SPEAKER_01]: and they throw metal halide in for the
last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it kind of, you know, kind of does
that same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's fun to, to be witnessing
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit repeat itself and see like,
okay, this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see why the science is starting to
catch up a little bit with what growers
[SPEAKER_01]: have already figured out in their home
gardens, which is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been, I've been running the
seven 30 nanometer red at the first seven
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes after lights off and seven minutes
prior to lights on to try and cut down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the photo period time of the plant
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to definitely do something
where it puts them to sleep faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: wakes them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm anthropomorphizing of
course, but there's something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the photo cell receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the, one of the photo receptors
responds to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually far red, the seven 30
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and another cool thing about that is,
is if you, if you're, if your base
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum or what I call my, so I speak in
terms of, I look at lights at spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just talking about this
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny on discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to tell people it's like,
look, if you have whatever light system
[SPEAKER_01]: you have, it doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have HPS right now if you wanted
to, or you have whatever your light system
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you could, instead of saying,
well, I can't afford this brand new fancy
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the line grow light, and I'm not
going to buy something worse than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to save my money,
save my money, and then go without for
[SPEAKER_01]: awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely a strategy or led has
gotten to the point where you can just get
[SPEAKER_01]: supplemental bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a light source right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get what you're missing and add it to
it, or maybe just add it to it at a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain part of, of flowering to stimulate
what you want and then pull it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could, you can add blues or you
could add red or you could add far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're saying you could add,
if you don't have far red in your light
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, you could add a far red booster
bar and do exactly what you're doing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would cost so little because you're
only running that thing seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because it doesn't, unless you run it
during the far red, during the light cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: as well, I would recommend doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the far red already in my light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I just do the extra supplemental for
the specifically to try and get that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that aspect of the Emerson effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been, so the Emerson effect is
running your far red with in conjunction
[SPEAKER_01]: with 660 red during your normal flowering
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed a huge, now I don't know how
much of how much of that increase or that
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased harvest window has to do with
the Emerson effect or with the far reds
[SPEAKER_01]: after, after the light cycle, because the
way the Emerson effect, what that does is
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't make the light that it's coming
down any more efficient, but it makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant more efficient using that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's more efficient, its metabolism
is faster and it's getting through its
[SPEAKER_01]: processes quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the jury is still out a little bit
on what is it that's exactly short and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's a combination of both.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's exciting to play with and take
advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a little user or operator
bias there as well on my part,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I definitely then tend to run the,
the generative leaning, the irrigations
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental settings to try and push
a faster finish as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: While still trying to, you know,
do a little bit of bulking, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of, if it's in my home grow,
I'll just kind of forgo that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the final product ends up that much
nicer if you just go generative the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to kind of steer the
conversation a little bit into,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to find out where people
started their journey with growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what got them into cannabis or,
you know, if they started with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and then grew vegetables afterwards,
I know that you are an avid gardener in
[SPEAKER_00]: your, in your spare time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, or did you, did you start growing
vegetables and then transitioned into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what was the, I guess the best way
to ask this is what's the first plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever grew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was definitely a vegetable of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a kid, I can still, I have still
memories of remembering back when I,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't know, toddler age or
something, but going out to the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: with my mom or my dad and working in the,
in the garden, because we had a pretty big
[SPEAKER_01]: family for, I have four siblings or three
siblings, four altogether of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's six in the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and mom and dad supplemented our food
with what they could grow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a decent sized garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, back then it was seemed like
more of a chore, but as I got,
[SPEAKER_01]: as an older adult and started sampling the
food I could get at the store,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can really tell the difference between
what you grow outside and what you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: at the store and the health benefits also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what got me into
cannabis was I had a cousin that was
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis here in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became a distantly illegal to grow
cannabis in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a cousin that was doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just going to say cousin,
so I won't name them, but I had a cousin
[SPEAKER_01]: that was doing well before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also when it became legal,
got the caregiver card, got on the program
[SPEAKER_01]: and started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got interested as hell because it's
another plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd go over there and look and
watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what really spurred me into
growing was that I did end up signing up
[SPEAKER_01]: for a caregiver program and started to get
a couple of patients signed up underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started growing my first cannabis
plants shortly thereafter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was probably six months into my
growing to where I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking down harvest every, you know,
a couple of months or whatever it was that
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a Facebook post from my uncle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was basically something that he'd
kept kind of secret from most of us was
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had really bad health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the doctors had actually in the post,
he was saying, I'm just letting you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctors just told me to go home and
get my affairs in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about two weeks to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just there was pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that he was diagnosed with stage
four pancreatic cancer and basically told
[SPEAKER_01]: him, you know, he had been going through
chemo and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically just told him with it,
he already had a bad heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all his other conditions,
they basically did all that they could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that moment, I just remember
replying, you know, just because they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't help you anymore doesn't mean there
isn't there isn't a cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, fast forward, I he ended up,
you know, at that point, he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I have to lose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started making like from my trim and
from like the small buzz off the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: the larvae stuff I started making and
researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And figuring out how to make cannabis oil
or Rick Simpson oil or whatever you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: FECO.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a billion different names you want
to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody wants to do it a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my approach is that and it's starting
to take steam because I'm actually reading
[SPEAKER_01]: a book right now with written by a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to shout this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't got through it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis cancer connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gold stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I read and I read ahead to just see
what his process was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's doing a lot of the same things
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love seeing that in a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely what my processes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to get as much of the different
cannabis as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is I want
different from each other in effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so sativa or indica, if you want
to look at it that way or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a bunch of different varieties,
because what I'm trying to do is collect
[SPEAKER_01]: the most medicinal compounds as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this one might have little oil,
but this one might have alpha pining and
[SPEAKER_01]: this one might have beta karyophylline,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I call it is my shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just loading that shotgun with
every little terpene and cannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm blasting the systems with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made the cannabis oil just like that
and got my uncle on a program of taking it
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incidentally, you have to be careful,
a little careful with cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: people on heavy medications, because
there's a lot of medications that will
[SPEAKER_01]: make those medications work better,
will enhance them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one of those cases was as blood
thinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: My uncle, not immediately, but rather
quickly had to titrate down off of his
[SPEAKER_01]: blood thinners lower and lower because
cannabis does a really good job,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially at high doses of thinning your
blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're about to go have a surgery
and you think you're going to cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: nerves by smoking something, you probably
should just pass on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just smoke a CBD one because the THC
for sure helps blood thinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it myself where I've had like a
little head surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just cut like a knot off my head,
but it blood like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, we've never seen a head
bleed like this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, oh yeah, I smoked before
I came in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to keep an eye when you're dealing
with other medications you got,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be careful and go slow and
figure things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fast forward from that a year after
that, post was made, he was diagnosed
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is he still around?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, unfortunately COVID ended up getting
them, but we did keep all of his medical
[SPEAKER_01]: records to show like the monthly shrinking
of the tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't stop the conventional
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to stress that, a lot of people
look at cannabis like it's for one,
[SPEAKER_01]: a cure for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a cure all for sure,
but it helps with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a replacement for modern
medicine as much as it can work right
[SPEAKER_01]: alongside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can cure a lot of the side effects of
modern medicine, especially chemo stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll revigorate your appetite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get you sleep so you can recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body can recover from everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's such a great point to
make that like a lot of people will just
[SPEAKER_00]: go, oh, you know, I just, I do the
millennial care package.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take ibuprofen and drink and take lots
of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like to put it in conjunction with,
you know, Western medicine, I guess we
[SPEAKER_00]: could call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like keeping that as part of your
regimen, just as a recovery process or
[SPEAKER_00]: even a mental sanity process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause for me, one of the biggest things
with hospitals is I just, I have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mental breakdown, like a panic attack when
I'm in a hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of my least favorite places
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, yeah, I could see how just in
general improving the overall demeanor of
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient could be extremely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also the fact that it is,
you know, there's, I believe the it's
[SPEAKER_00]: either the USDA or there's another patent
on, I think it's Delta nine THC for cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget exactly what it is, but I,
I'm pretty sure I've even heard you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it on the growing with my fellow
growers podcast, or maybe Jack talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it or something, but it was very
eyeopening to know that it's known and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's patented and it's withheld.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, yeah, I mean, seeing the
success that your uncle found in using a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil to increase the odds of
survival and remission and even going
[SPEAKER_00]: fully cancer-free, that's incredible after
being given a two week ticket basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's, that does something to
your psyche and your mental power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I like, like you brought up
just the, the attitude of a person,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a healing power of the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have placebos and tests
because there is a healing power in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of examples where people
took placebos and got better thinking they
[SPEAKER_01]: were taking the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to have a positive outlook on life
and to have the idea and the belief that,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, whatever this is, it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's healing just in that, which is
amazing to believe, but just because we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't explain it with science doesn't mean
that it doesn't work and it's not helping
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what most frustrating thing with
me when it comes to cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because that experience for me,
I was on board ever since it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it with my own eyes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it with my own eyes and can't
tell me it's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, you know, and with all the
history of cannabis and the government and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, I'm going to trust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Government agency now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but yeah, and ever since that
moment with my uncle and that cancer free
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosis, I mean, I literally balled like
a baby when he called me to tell me,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's healing for the healer too,
especially in his family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but ever since that time,
I had the, the fortune to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on this different social media platforms
on YouTube, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it gives me connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, even locally throughout the state
and, um, people will, uh, offer just to
[SPEAKER_01]: donate me their trim or, or whatever,
because they know what I do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I make the cannabis oil and I
store it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, when there's people in the
community that need help, if somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: reaches out that has cancer, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm, I'm getting that to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though, you know, I might not have
that person's name registered to me by the
[SPEAKER_01]: state as a patient, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a caregiver for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to help people if I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and I continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, cannabis has afforded me the
ability to, to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've worked commercially in cannabis,
uh, at Mitten Canico here in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw the commercial side of things,
which was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I was, I learned quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a little different,
you know, scaling up to see what it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: to scale up in a regulated space,
which you're not just scaling up like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what would it be like to grow more
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just that it's like, you're in a
regulated space where you can do these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, you got metric compliance,
metric compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it gets you for every little
thing, uh, that you didn't even know you
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing wrong in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one that always got me was having
to like bag and keep on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, defoliation, like just biomass and
weigh it and then dispose it either like
[SPEAKER_00]: in a specific manner, whether it be like
burying it or like mixing it with other
[SPEAKER_00]: rubbish so that it's unusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, who's using leaves unless
you're making a smoothie or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and even that, you're just getting
some like really low dose cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that are probably not THC, unless it's
like deep in flour and you're pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's like, why are you doing
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a stigma that will take, you know,
this is going to sound terrible,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think there's a lot of truth in it,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, it's going to take some of the
dinosaurs to die before we really kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma of cannabis as, as a drug rather
than cannabis as a medicine, or,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can look at cannabis as a
drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is, if you think about it in
the aspect of a pharmaceutical kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it's just a more of a herbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think why cannabis is, is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So special is because of our
endocannabinoid system that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors that can literally bind to the
components that we're, we're growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but cannabis is so diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these different medical compounds,
like cannabis got me into growing other
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got an herb garden out there
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have an ailment in any,
anything, it could be something as simple
[SPEAKER_01]: as a, I got a runny nose or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at my books and I'm looking
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What plant can help me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to me, I look at it like I look at
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather have the whole food rather than
something processed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can just grow my cure in my
backyard and it gives you so much power,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, uh, take your control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, it's you taking control
of your own health, but instead of having
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to a, you know, a doctor and take a
prescription, I'm not saying that's bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if I can avoid all that and just take
something out of my backyard, it makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my easiest comparison to that is
like, I feel so much better during summer
[SPEAKER_00]: than I do during winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Oregon, you're in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the, the, the cold basically
just, you're, you're just importing crop
[SPEAKER_00]: all winter just to have something fresh,
unless you're getting it from someone with
[SPEAKER_00]: hoop houses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that, you know, usually you're
going to like a local farmer's market or a
[SPEAKER_00]: co-op or something, and that can get
pretty pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you had like summertime when you
got all that fresh produce and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it's medicine itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, it's cool to, for me, cause a lot
of times I'll sit back, whether I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening outside, you know, in the
vegetable garden or the herb garden or the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to me, like diagnosed in a plant
problem or whatever, it reminds me almost
[SPEAKER_01]: like the human body, you know,
our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I look at food now more like it's
like it is a medicine because it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: another plant that we're consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, like the, the microbes that
you want in organic gardening and your
[SPEAKER_01]: root system is very similar to the
microbes that you want in your guts to
[SPEAKER_01]: digest these plants, uh, when you're
eating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild to see all of the coincidences
of the things that are so similar between
[SPEAKER_01]: human health and plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I absolutely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really crazy to think that,
um, you know, so many medicines were found
[SPEAKER_00]: out just through the application of like
either consuming it or putting it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: topical on skin and just seeing what the
reaction was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, you know, the, just the slow
and arduous process of figuring out what
[SPEAKER_00]: plants worked for what, um, by all of our,
you know, past ancestors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we do have like all these methods
that we can use where it's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of a plant or the,
yeah, the application of some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: derived product from just something that
you can grow in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and how it almost seems like we like
evolve together or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we definitely helped spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was around way before we were,
but we definitely helped spread it
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if there's a maybe,
maybe this is a big maybe maybe somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: in a igloo somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have an indoor grow around,
but, uh, there might be a root or is
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging around a nearby river somewhere,
still surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think canvas is a hell of a survivor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's around, it's still around
for, for a reason because it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not, not even just helpful to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's helpful to a lot of other
species too, but, uh, we've spread it all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know there was like this,
um, almost a deficiency within the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the human, uh, endocannabinoid system for
the longest time after hemp was removed as
[SPEAKER_00]: a crop in the United States, because it
was fed a lot of times to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: dairy cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there would be trace, uh,
cannabinoids within milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were actually satiating
their CB1 and CB2 receptors through,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like either raw milk consumption,
or even, I believe it was even still in
[SPEAKER_00]: pasteurized milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, yeah, once a hemp was removed
as a feed option for cattle, it was no
[SPEAKER_00]: more, no more, uh, cannabinoids in your
average, uh, Americans, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't want to say it's a
destined thing or whatever, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's plenty of examples of other,
of other things that connect to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, our receptors in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't say that, of course,
that it's, it's destined, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, like you said, our ancestors have
found that, uh, the medicinal properties
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, they might not know the science of
it, but they know that it, that it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why it's prevailed
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done well because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, there's a lot of our other
medicinal plants produce a lot of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and, and volatile compounds that
are medicinal to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, this plant just is special
because it like gathers a bunch of them
[SPEAKER_01]: together rather than just being a plant
that's high, like the pine needle that's
[SPEAKER_01]: high and maybe alpha pining, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, this cannabis plant wouldn't
have that, but it also has THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has, you know, some of these
other, maybe CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think the biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing that I'm a little disappointed in,
in the cannabis field of today is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is we deal with a lot of extremes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's pushing for the highest THC
or the highest CBD, the highest,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think the medicine is more in a
balance is more, you know, multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: different, uh, levels of them in a right
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because every human body is a little
bit different and people might react a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit differently, they've got to
find the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: For them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I found as a caregiver is,
um, it made me into what I'm now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call myself the perpetual phenol hunter
because, uh, it made me realize that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if I smoke something,
it might not be super great for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my buddy can smoke it and it might
help them with his back or it might help
[SPEAKER_01]: them with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's valuable information for
that person at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then when we get the human,
the whole human consensus together and
[SPEAKER_01]: start saying, you know, I love seeing
sites like that, like, Hey, so-and-so said
[SPEAKER_01]: this train works really good for X,
Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mom, you know, suffers from X,
Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to get me some seeds of that
and I'm going to give it to her and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see if that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, when that stuff actually works,
when that stuff works out like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're like, well, someone said this works
best all the way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like gorilla glue was a good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom really liked that, um, for her
joint pains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's just like, you feel,
like you're the scientist and that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the guy running the test to see,
you know, if the rumors are true,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with cannabis, it's like the,
the cat's out of the bag, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever the government decides to do,
people know that it's healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many, you want to call it
anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call it that for sure,
because you, you say government has made
[SPEAKER_01]: it so you can't study it until it gets off
that first schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anecdotal evidence, but these are
anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: People walking around alive today,
not suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what is that worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of a test size do you need like a
test population?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need for it to no longer be
anecdotal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, like, and I feel like
there's definitely, there's enough data
[SPEAKER_00]: out there for someone to aggregate
together and create an actual,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like a metadata study to, to create,
you know, um, a non anecdotal approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining why certain things do what they
do when they come from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you're absolutely right though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, you know, it's schedule one,
so it's heroin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and no one's going to provide
funding and research at a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: level to, um, to study that, um,
unless you, you have some, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like you have to find some
eccentric individual who is willing to go
[SPEAKER_00]: against the system because they don't care
or their past doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I feel like that's far and few in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot more people that are at that
level of, um, social, uh, privilege are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more interested in the culture of
cannabis than the medicine behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, yeah, but you're absolutely
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we can call it anecdotal,
but if we see it working, then we can just
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to promote it, um, as
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you do on so many different
platforms and, you know, I feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the fact that you go and you talk to,
um, like politicians and you, you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: people out for demonstrations to,
uh, promote the, you know, the information
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out there and not for it to be put
behind these sort of, uh, stigmatic
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers where people are like,
I'm not even going to talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: because, uh, you know, my grandma told me
that when people smoke cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start worshiping the devil and I'm a
devout Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not even going to consider that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's, everyone has their
encampments and it's really hard to break
[SPEAKER_00]: free of some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I do believe you're absolutely
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the dinosaurs need to go
extinct in order for the, the new,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the new mentalities to prevail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I do have one for like,
you bring that up, it automatically clicks
[SPEAKER_01]: in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if I, if I get a religious,
like, especially on, especially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Christian side of things, um, pushback on,
on the use of cannabis, I like to remind
[SPEAKER_01]: them of a, of the passage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's Genesis that says that,
uh, that they basically, God gave us all
[SPEAKER_01]: seed bearing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, even though we try to keep ours
from having seeds, they all come from a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are seed bearing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like this in Samia, but the Samias
are all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's evidence that I've seen
some compelling arguments that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, in the early, uh, oils, THC could
have, or, uh, cannabis could have been in
[SPEAKER_01]: there or in the holy anointing oils or
even, uh, what they've burned is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: incense as they walked up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at the original assassin
order that were called the Hashishines who
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked hash in order to put them in a
mindset to, um, have this almost
[SPEAKER_00]: religious, uh, experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they were like tying into their,
uh, culture of, uh, political
[SPEAKER_00]: assassinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like it, there's definitely the
ability to tie cannabis into a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: power or an, uh, like a higher entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's, uh, you know, how you live your
life or what you like to believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's historical evidence for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just consuming cannabis, I like to
call it a life enhancer because,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not only is it medicinal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely is medicinal, but for me,
I'm, I'm a big lover of music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes music so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pick out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to play in a, in a band in school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, like I can kind of pick out all
the different instruments and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I'll hear like a whole
instrument that I never even knew was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the, when, where did that
come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I never can't hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unlock something or a more focus or
whatever it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, there's so many food,
food tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, whatever you're doing,
of course, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You like go to church high, of course,
that would be a more religious spirit,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, experience in, I don't understand why
a church would want to discourage that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, I think cannabis a hundred
percent has its place in a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of places because of that,
because it's life enhancer, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, uh, to even have like
someone like, uh, Ralph, uh, Michulin,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is his name, who the guy that
discovered the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, it is, it is as real as our
nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is as real as our circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for it to not even be taught in
medical schools yet, or at least in most
[SPEAKER_00]: medical schools and, uh, medical
disciplines, it's, it's almost the Travis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a travesty, you know, it's,
um, it's like willful blindness,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, or, or yeah, just willful ignorance,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's why I love the, uh,
the internet and I love, uh, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: good side of social media and things like
this is that, uh, everybody has a voice
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can choose to listen to it or not
listen to it, but you can get your voice
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be heard and, um, you can get
around some of the smoking and that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of put in front of you by
governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to try to steer you in one way
or the other to be able to talk to other
[SPEAKER_01]: people who may have experienced things
that you haven't, uh, could really open
[SPEAKER_01]: your eyes, can really open your eyes to
other points of view, which is a scary
[SPEAKER_01]: thing for a government.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, they like you to think in a
specific way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we've, we've kind of gotten
a little off topic, but I've loved this
[SPEAKER_00]: thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't tried to slow us down,
but I'm going to try and steer us back a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit towards cultivation because,
um, I want to, I want to have people know
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more about your cultivation
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so what was the first cannabis plants
that you grew after you had a caregiver,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, card or were you, um, you know,
did you ever do any, uh, gorilla grows or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pop a couple of seeds when you
were younger or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, what, what, uh, yeah,
what was like the first experience growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty, uh, I was pretty,
uh, late into the game and really when it
[SPEAKER_01]: came to growing, I didn't do any gorilla
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have since, but not before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and most of the gorilla growing is
just all outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to throw an extra couple of
plants outside just to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch more so I can make more oil for
people or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, especially like nowadays I'm
thinking of doing that with funny enough
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is like, I could throw a couple of
plants out there and grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of pounds of CBD, throw it in the
freezer and I have enough to just mix into
[SPEAKER_01]: every little batch, um, to, to make it
that more diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that is the plan going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, my first plants were grown as a
caregiver and I started out in cocoa and
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe, I don't remember if they
were fabric pots or plastic pots at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but, uh, I know I moved to fabric,
uh, shortly after, but I hated how,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they, you had to water extremely
slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose a lot of your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, uh, pretty quickly went away from
fabric pots and stayed with, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic pots and cocoa is, is how I did
probably the first two or three years
[SPEAKER_01]: before I started playing around with,
uh, organic growing at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really it was out of a, I'm not a huge
fan of having to measure out 12 bottles of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't a fan of the quality when I
measured out of three bottles of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it was more a push to make it
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people say, oh, you can just throw
water on it and you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even have to pH that shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not one person to say you're full
of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one to be like, all right,
I'll try one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see, see what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you're full of shit or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I quickly found, uh, sub
irrigated planters or SIP containers and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that is, is a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a pot with a reservoir below it
and the water wicks up so you can water
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant kind of drinks water at its
own rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a city picker or something like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My absolute favorite one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them right at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available to most everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I grew a tomato in one of
those, I was blown away at how big a
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato could get in such a small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's this combination of
like, uh, hydroponics where you get this
[SPEAKER_00]: like availability of water that you
wouldn't normally get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, like just like, uh, like an,
uh, like a soil, like a sand silt and
[SPEAKER_00]: clay, um, outside, uh, like it's just,
you, you lose a lot of water availability
[SPEAKER_00]: to the matrix potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have that sub irrigated
planter and like, you can, you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in that top part really,
as long as you get those roots down into
[SPEAKER_00]: that water, you're golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, they act like they're
in a much bigger space that they get.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get some monster plants and SIP
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I've even done multiple plants in
a sub container, but I still like to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm in a plant count state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to do, if it wasn't a plant
count state, I would be growing much
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller plants and just harvesting colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for organics, it's better to grow
probably a bigger pot anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I found SIP containers,
uh, there was no looking back,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much easier for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got into organic soils and,
and wow, that's an onion that's as big as
[SPEAKER_01]: this world that you can peel back and get
layers until you're dying day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can forever have something to dig
into to keep yourself, uh, more,
[SPEAKER_01]: more interested in growing because
there's, there's, there's so many fights
[SPEAKER_01]: just within the organic community and what
who's organic enough, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, it can be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be, I'm trying to be the
peacemaker guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look guys, we're all cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we agree on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we agree on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the two encampments of like the
practice of organics versus the religion
[SPEAKER_00]: of organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're like, some people don't even
want to hear if somebody else is doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you guys are both growing
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, uh, let's just try to share
knowledge rather than say that mine's
[SPEAKER_00]: better than yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and everybody's situation is
different and their environment is
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, something that works really
good for me might suck for somebody,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in California or somebody in
Texas, who knows, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I, I always, I found that
out myself the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't try to try to, um,
I don't, I don't, I don't try to fault
[SPEAKER_01]: people for not really knowing that so
much, but for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here trying to get people
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the end goal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is just get more people growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you were first starting out in
the SIP containers, were you, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking with like cocoa coir and feeding
it, um, a hydroponic fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or did you immediately switch over to
a, like, amended substrate or a soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: media, uh, you know, with, uh,
like organic meals and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: with like the high, uh, biological
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went with just, uh, I went with just a
bag soil, uh, locally bagged soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, from, it was called M3 mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, here in Michigan, and I just
dumped that in my SIP container,
[SPEAKER_01]: threw away all the crap that came with the
SIP container as far as nutrients went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just set it aside to use outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, uh, and it just wanted to see,
cause the, the, the bag of soil said water
[SPEAKER_01]: only soil too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to test this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did that and put it in the
container at the same time and got great
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and for the longest time I would
replace my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take the, I would, at the end of
harvest, I would take that, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil block, that pot, that SIP container,
take it out to my compost pile and dump
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then I, the next spring I'd
be digging out that compost pile to build
[SPEAKER_01]: beds for my vegetable gardens or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, those are probably great beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, one round of Michigan made mix.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me think of like building like
four by eight beds with like build a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're, it's like, that's going to be
the best vegetable garden for like 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of worms just loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, but then I got to the point
to where I started figuring out,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you can just re-amend the soil,
which makes it even easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm not hauling these things outside
and dumping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not dumping them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm throwing some amendments on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might dig out a, you know, a big enough
hole to plant my plant into this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's really the only soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times I can break that soil
up and put it right back on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not really taking anything from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always just adding to what I
already have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the current system that
I'm still doing at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my home garden isn't like,
I mean, if you compared the Trichome Forge
[SPEAKER_01]: with the home, my home garden,
you'd probably laugh a little bit because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Trichome Forge is just like a
race car, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cocoa, it's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we're Fino hunting all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, PVC walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what you would dream to have as
a, as a, that's what me and my buddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, baked poem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, we're just going to set it
up for what we always wish we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but at home, it's just like,
it's designed for connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, you know, it's just like a
room I built out myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a stick room with some,
uh, of the Panda film and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still way more than a lot of people
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true, but it's not like what I have
going on over there at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I go down there and it's just like
my happy space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sit in the flower room, just look at
the plants for a while, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, such great weather, especially in
the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, um, let's, let's break down your
home grow and then we'll break down the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, trichome forge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, since you're doing organics at
home, let's start there and like just to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through kind of what your general
practices are, um, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be like, like, like if you're
cloning or popping seeds or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining mother plant populations and
then, um, like how you maintain those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and then also like when you get into
flower what is your sort of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your process for flowering out a
plant, um, in an organic amended,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, soilless media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, basically I start, I usually start
from clones for most of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The system that I have, uh, in the,
uh, the Coliseum we'll call it Spartans
[SPEAKER_01]: Coliseum down there is, is that I have
keeper plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like four to five slots that I can
keep that strain around, but I'm always
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a new strain from seed and it's
had, it's going up head to head against
[SPEAKER_01]: these other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's better than any one of these,
it's just going to replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm always bringing in new genetics
from seed and it's always, but the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm keeping are always improving
because as I get more genetics that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like better than what I have, I just
replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been doing that since caregiver
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I've always been able to
retain my quality is that I'm constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: striving to find that better strain or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I've cycled to a quite a few of
them, but I'm never done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I don't know if I'll ever be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Fino hunt and the possibility
of the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually it's going to be a cutting or
it could be a seed, but they both go into,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it used to be root riot cubes,
but I've since switched to Velocigro
[SPEAKER_01]: cubes, which is like a vegetable based,
um, you said it's called Velocigro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Velocigro I believe is the name of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started getting them and using
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like almost like a biochar gel cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a little bit of nitrogen,
a little bit of nutrition in there for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the different thing that makes
them different is they're kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: jello substance, like consistent
consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, almost like an agar or something
that you might use for tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like an agar, but you just,
you stick it in there and then you just
[SPEAKER_01]: want the bottom to be in contact with
water at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could put them in a tray,
your traditional tray, as long as there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the bottom of what's holding your cube
and just fill that bottom tray with water
[SPEAKER_01]: and let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right now running them without even a
clone dome, but my humanity is pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably 50% in there anyway,
but, um, but they're sitting in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them because they break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hate how we're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the glue that they use in the root
riot cubes or that type of cube never
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find them still in my compost pile
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to send me a, um, the name for
those and I'll put a link in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the show notes because that that's
really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's one thing that I've always
found is like the closest thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could find for like an organic based or
something that would break down fully in
[SPEAKER_00]: an organic media would be like an Oasis
cube, but handling those is a pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if, uh, I think I've heard you say
that you've tried them before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know other people that if they
haven't, you know, it's like, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a sponge that doesn't bounce
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, if you squish it at all or
crunch it, it just is no longer really
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but so that a gel based cloning media
and are they like very, um, are they very
[SPEAKER_00]: sturdy or would it like break apart like
jello if you like squished it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you squished it, that would break apart
like jello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you have to be a little,
uh, a little more gentle with them for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we actually on the let's be buds,
um, show on YouTube, we did interview the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy from velocity grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's a, there is a, um,
episode that with all the information,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're interested on, on there,
but, um, I've had some, some pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: luck so far with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think they, they do, at least I
might, maybe I'm doing something wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they do seem to take a little long,
maybe two, uh, little past two weeks to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to germinate or to get roots, but I'm not
picking them up because they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: gentle because normally I'd be grabbing
the stems and just looking in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, I'm just like looking down and
seeing if I see any roots popping out
[SPEAKER_01]: around the edges yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I see roots popping out,
then I'll reach down in there and pull a
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains and know that it's going to,
cause if you don't have roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you were to pull, it would just pull
the cutting right out of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could stick it right back in,
but you're making holes and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: really, it doesn't stay together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greatest they're working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that another version were to be a
little bit tighter, but I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, and there's a little bit of
nutrition in them so I can stick them in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little half gallon planter or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, with that, after they get a
couple of roots and they still have
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition for awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have to give it food if I
didn't want to, but after I get it rooted,
[SPEAKER_01]: after I get a rooted cut or a seedling,
which I also put in a cube, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just plant that into usually like a
solo cup size, like a half gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, just to get them started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they, uh, are ready to transplant out
of that, they usually it's two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll either go into a one gallon pot or
directly into my slip container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes that determination is,
is do I have room for it in the bedroom
[SPEAKER_01]: into a big pot or does that have to stay
in a smaller pot for right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I say that is I run a perpetual
grow, which means that I have a one light
[SPEAKER_01]: flower right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I have four plants underneath
that one light, but each plant is at a
[SPEAKER_01]: different age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as one plant goes out, I put another
plant in and, but this way I'm harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm harvesting a plant, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every whatever the hell that that goes out
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you, if you figure I usually like
2.5 weeks or 2.3 weeks or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what your harvest window is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying, I usually go about nine
weeks on most of my strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, you get a more consistent
supply of cannabis that way instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's more important for me is it's a
lower amount of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd rather take that workload,
that same workload, instead of doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: all at once, I'd rather get it divided up
by four, like the four plants doing one at
[SPEAKER_01]: a time rather than having to do all four
plants at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it just works my system a lot
better that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, I can't really change the
light cycles too much to be too crazy in
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower room because there are all the
different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to, you know, suppress the
stretch, but the other plant in there is
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the harvest, that's kind of
counterintuitive to do different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what I'm doing as far as light
cycles in the flower room is I'm,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do simulate the, the daily sun in a way
I start out with a more red, warm spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: during the middle of the, during the
beginning of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, um, in the middle part of the light
cycle, the middle three hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes to almost all blue, almost pure
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes back down to,
uh, more reds at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I do that is, um,
it's a way for me to sneak more blue light
[SPEAKER_01]: into the flower cycle so that I can get
that increased cannabinoid production from
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far I've, I've had good results
doing it that way under my schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I'd be doing all kinds of weird
stuff if they were all in the same light
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle or the same, uh, age, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go from, from, I go from that small pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll call it, uh, either a cup or a,
or a gallon, it goes into a sip container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, after it gets into a sip
container, and this is all judged by how
[SPEAKER_01]: do you judge when you're going to
transplant up or whatever, it's all judged
[SPEAKER_01]: by the size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my veg basically has always got
plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my only rule is if it's leaving the
bedroom, I have to have a clone or a cut
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's, uh, going into a sip
container, it's going to have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if it's, yeah, if it's going into a sip
container, I want to make sure that at
[SPEAKER_01]: that time, uh, I'm pulling my clone
usually, because then I'll have,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have an answer to, is it,
do I have a rooted clone when this is
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to come out of the bedroom?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't have a rooted clone,
when I'm coming out of the bedroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: I might consider skipping that plan until
I do and take another plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've, I've lost too many strains that
I've really liked because I've tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: rush something into from the veg into the
flower room, but I didn't have,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a cut taken, but I didn't have a
rooted yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that root, of course that cut didn't
root.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, now I'm in flower and I'm looking
at a revenge situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, those a lot of times you get
mixed results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've changed my thing a little bit and
make sure that I always have them backed
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, after the veg,
so I couldn't tell you how long of a veg I
[SPEAKER_01]: have because it depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Mac one that might veg for two
freaking months because it's such a slow
[SPEAKER_01]: grower and veg shows out in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I don't really stress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just plant, plant the, uh, put the
plants in as they get bigger, they get
[SPEAKER_01]: moved up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I take a plant out of the
flower room, I'm harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to have a open hole in the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say no open holes in the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to always fill the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take whatever the biggest plant is
in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't have one that I feel is
completely ready, I'd still rather take
[SPEAKER_01]: one that's almost ready out of veg than
have light hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be hitting plant material for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, before you go into your, uh,
your, uh, flowering cycle practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know that this is something that I
just talked about, uh, on one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: recent, uh, the way we grow podcasts with,
uh, Toucan Sam, uh, from Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause he also runs perpetual, uh,
flower and, um, you know, IPM for me is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those, uh, the big questions when
it comes to perpetual cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so what, what do you do for IPM,
uh, whether it be in veg or in flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in flower or in, in veg, I do your
traditional IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about once a week, and sometimes I even
slack on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My IPM game is not the super strongest,
but I do do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that, I'll tell you
here coming up, but, um, I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I do take the practice that I've
gotten from the commercial industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have a pair of Crocs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my favorite garden shoes,
but I have a pair of Crocs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated for the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, I used to, when I was a
caregiver, um, with a lot of patients when
[SPEAKER_01]: a full card, I had one time I would
actually have a pair of scrubs that I got
[SPEAKER_01]: at a secondhand store that I would change
into to go in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I'm not taking anything into the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then once a week, I would,
uh, spray a oil-based spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually lost coast plant therapy is
probably one of my favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've just had great results with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the only thing I'd ever do to add to
it is if I was fighting thrips,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would add.
[SPEAKER_01]: An equal amount of isopropyl alcohol to
the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm using 30 milliliters of lost
coast in a gallon, I'd use 30 milliliters
[SPEAKER_01]: of ISO as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really helps to dry them out and
take them out 70% or a 90% or on the ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think the stuff that I use was in
the nineties, 92% or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but as far as, and then,
um, I used to use predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, often, but, uh, now I've, I've
completely replaced predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, in my flower rooms, I'm running
the predator lights from Jan Grandmaster
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that is is it's a UVC light and
it's new to us, but not new at all in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we happened upon the, uh, the CEO of
Grandmaster LEDs happened to cross a
[SPEAKER_01]: expired patent on a UVC light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's how we began our journey
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing our research on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, they've been using it in like the
Netherlands, UVC light too, because not
[SPEAKER_01]: only for pest control, but they've been
using it for, uh, molds and things because
[SPEAKER_01]: they have such much stricter, um,
regulations on what they can use and spray
[SPEAKER_01]: on their plants there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they have like these big booms
that just bring the UVC lights and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and bathe the plants in the lights,
uh, automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've done on these lights is they
just hang under canopy facing each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're facing up to where the bugs
usually like to hang out, uh, underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: They try to hide from the, the light a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, they also run it in the
night cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they act almost because they do,
UVC still does have some visible light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does emit some light, but it's not
enough to trigger the photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't lose your, you know,
you don't have any hermaphrodites or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, uh, you don't lose your photo
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, doesn't disrupt the SCOTO
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't interrupt it at all,
but it acts like a bug light in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a dark room, that little bit of light
attracts the pests kind of towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then the UVC just nukes their DNA
and then makes it so that they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually they will just die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been running those prototypes and
now the actual launch units in my flower
[SPEAKER_01]: room for almost a year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's made me so lazy, so lazy with
the, with the IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but the reason I don't use them
in my, in my bedroom is for one,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a set in there, but for two,
I don't technically have a, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: technically keep mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I do, you know, clone consistently
off the plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if UVC, I mean,
I do know that the UVC is damaging the DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pests, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if the UVC is enough to
damage the, the DNA of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if it were, if it were, those plants
get harvested and don't get cloned anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there is any kind of small DNA
change or whatever like that, I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting myself from that by taking that
clone from the bedroom that isn't treated
[SPEAKER_01]: with UVC from a plant that hasn't been
exposed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could keep the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just the one step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm still doing the sprays
in my veg because my veg kinda is my
[SPEAKER_01]: mother room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to call those mother plants,
they are getting clones taken off of my
[SPEAKER_01]: guests, you could call those mothers,
but I'm not specifically saving the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: for long periods of time that I'm cutting
off of, because I think that's just a bank
[SPEAKER_01]: to get pests or diseases or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer plants alive, the longer it's,
you know, able to pick up those diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think plants that sit in pots and
get root bound and do that are more apt to
[SPEAKER_01]: that than plants that are actively growing
and getting potted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can just take a clone and get
that clone growing, you can get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: that mom plant, if you're not gonna
flower, in my opinion, or in my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've found in the commercial space that
the more often you clone a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more vigor and health you maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also through like, cause we
always wash our slip cuttings before we
[SPEAKER_00]: stick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like an extra barrier to
make sure that any bugs or populations are
[SPEAKER_00]: going through multiple treatments
throughout all the different stages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, that's really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I remember correctly, I think that
you were the first person I ever heard
[SPEAKER_00]: using wettable sulfur in cannabis
cultivation, you know, three or four years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago when I was listening to the cheap home
grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like you've moved towards
oil-based in your veg cycle or in your veg
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that you're not using
sulfur anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what made you go away from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So wettable sulfur, I still have in my
arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still in my tool belt, we'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would use that for is for the
tougher, like for me, the only thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, knock on some wood here,
but the things that I've been struggling
[SPEAKER_01]: with mostly that show up in my garden
would be a thrip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just found that wettable sulfur is
not very effective on trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very effective on spider mites
and a lot of the mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I, that was the second one that I
would get is occasionally still get spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happened, that's when the
wettable sulfur comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to remember with sulfur is for
one, it's a plant nutrient and it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis specifically likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's kind of the key to a lot
of the skunkier, smellier, more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: foul and volatile compounds, whether that
be a terpene or an ester or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want, if you have a skunk plant
and it's, well, there's all these fruity
[SPEAKER_01]: skunks, but if there's a skunk that you
say is skunky, give it a little extra
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur, maybe some epsom salts and see if
you get a little bit more skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to spray that on your
plant, it's almost like a foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is a foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does it have the effect of pretty
much nuking the mites, but it also gives
[SPEAKER_01]: them the plants a little bit of nutrition,
foliar nutrition of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a little trick of mine,
but I don't use it a lot now because I
[SPEAKER_01]: just haven't had issues with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I were to have issue with spider
mite, I would break that sulfur back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have the same bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the great thing about wettable
sulfur is you're not buying water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it in and it lasts, I think
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see how it could go bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like elemental sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I still do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't sprayed it recently,
but I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I would caution people as
far as sulfur is concerned is don't burn
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur, especially modernly around LED
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will actually mess up the LED diodes
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the coatings can't deal with that
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you burn sulfur, you can really mess
up an LED fixture that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because I'll spray sulfur or use
it as a dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have noticed that maybe it's like
some sort of oxidative factor of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does seem to speed up like iron
oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get like rust a little more
quickly in certain areas if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also just could be like the
moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not a chemical scientist
who could tell you the exact properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to hear that you still have
that in your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for me, it's like the go-to if I
have russet mites or if I have powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those two specifically, it seems to
be a foolproof approach to removing those
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy populations if they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an excellent knockdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it continues to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it dries on the leaf, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see it on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost looks like PMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll dry on the leaf and it'll
continue to help protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if a mite still happens to be there
and crawls through it, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be a happy mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If their style or whatever it is that they
use to like poke into the plant tissue to
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb whatever nutrients or whatnot that
they're getting from the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they go through a sulfur barrier,
they're going to be really fucking pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love the barrier there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because also, if you're not using sulfur
and you're using oil-based products like
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey Horticultural Oil or Sufoil,
you definitely see that residue there
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's still like if a fungus net
flies and walks around on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sometimes just gets stuck to the oil
residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of is that visual assurance
that it's working the way that you want it
[SPEAKER_00]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one caution, speaking of...
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have an oil-based, if you sprayed
an oil-based and then you want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: wettable sulfur, don't do those close
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't play well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wait a week or two weeks even before
you were to apply one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also suggest doing like a water spray
down in between as well, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going from sulfur to oil,
because you can really rinse the sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: off really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the oil, you really need to let
that like absorb fully or dissipate
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is that it's doing to no
longer have that direct residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've melted some plants and I'm with
sulfur too close to oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I've had people be
like, no, it can't be that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a try and you'll never want to do
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know exactly what's going on the
next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like leaves, they're only like veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf matter is fully gone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like not even dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gone.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so let's kind of, now that we've
talked a little bit about your veg
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, how you're looking to source
your next plants for your flowering cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and the IPM practices that you've used up
until that point, let's talk about your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower cycle, how you prep your your sip
planters for a flower cycle and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do throughout the flower cycle
for each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make sure that it finishes the way you
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the flower cycle, it's the only
thing I like to, well before, so right
[SPEAKER_01]: before switch, maybe the day or maybe two
days before, I like to go in and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and I put a little PVC frame on
it with a grid, usually out of jute rope
[SPEAKER_01]: or something and like a trellis knot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to shape, you know, I shape the
plant a little bit underneath that trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: knot to spread out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually the net is used to spread
everything out a little bit to,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause what I look at is I look at the size
of my planter, the sip container is about
[SPEAKER_01]: the size that my canopy needs to fill
because you can fit all four of those
[SPEAKER_01]: planters perfectly into a four by four
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm trying to flower is a
four by four space or five by five,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you count the edges spilling over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so that's what I'm doing with the
plant is in my head is like, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get these branches out to fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no holes in my canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I will do a little bit of
lollipopping at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take in, bring any of the really low
branches that I know just from experience
[SPEAKER_01]: that they'll never reach it to where I
have the net set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take them off now so they don't waste
resources and growing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then I might do some,
some defoliation at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that I have decent airflow
throughout the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I move it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, at that time, usually within the
first to second day of it being in flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a top dress and, uh, I have two
top dresses that I'll, that I'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout all of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first top dress I do is usually a
mix of, I'll do some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do some, uh, gypsum, and then I'll do
a, like a mix of like a mineral blend and
[SPEAKER_01]: my favorite one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I like to use a lot is craft blend
from build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I also have a, a flowering balloon
blend from a local source here,
[SPEAKER_01]: country roots in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I use his worm castings to
his worm get shout out country roots for
[SPEAKER_01]: his worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll got a nice story for you to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed a box or I grabbed his last bag
at a booth he had at an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, is this been sitting here all
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, yeah, but it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just busting his balls, you know,
the whole thing about if you buy it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bag, it's probably dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put this thing in my basement and I
already had some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just getting low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they said it sat in my basement for two
months, literally two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just opened it about two weeks ago and,
uh, I was amending some, some worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings and I take a scoop of worm
castings out and living worms still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living live worms in it still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, man, this is the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a big fan of, of that guy's
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Chris out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a worm bin that I just let over
winter outside and like, you'll go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll maybe find a few small worms
wriggling around in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as soon as like you get that
first 50 or 55 degree day, I'll go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden there's thousands of
worms that have hatched and already like
[SPEAKER_00]: are fully grown or maybe they were small
and I just didn't catch them before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it's crazy how resilient they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, as long as there's still
some good biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, and they can stay dormant in
their cocoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when they, you know, that,
that little thing on the, on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the middle of the worm that everybody
sees, well they wiggle out of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's their, that's their cocoon and the
cocoons, uh, in there will pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: stay dormant until the conditions are
perfect for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll get two to three worms out
of each cocoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, that's how crazy you can get
some old worm castings that weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: screened to that fine of a size to pull
the cocoons out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can have worm castings in a bucket
for, for years, throw some water into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden there's worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms are magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of that guy's company
again?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called country roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Michigan.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an Instagram for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the guy's name is Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw him at the event with the Trichome
Forge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We event, uh, different events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I run into him a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, flower room, uh, quick question on
your blends of the, the mineral blends
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, I'm sure people are familiar
with the build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then this, this other guy's blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think I've heard you say before
that you've used down to earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like the bio live or the all purpose,
um, do either of those, uh, you feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, mimic or, or are similar to,
um, the, the craft blend from build a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, uh, in terms of if people have one
like down to earth available because it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so ubiquitous, what would,
what would be your, uh, your choice out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those that people should go for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the down to earth for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, bio life was the one that I was
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the reason I like, uh, the one from
build a soil is for one, what Jeremy's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing over there with every one of his
inputs, he doesn't take the manufacturer's
[SPEAKER_01]: word for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He independently test them to make sure
for in organics, we got to worry a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the hidden, the hidden thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plants were grown or dynamic
accumulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're top dressing with heavy
metals, um, or we're wrapping the pet
[SPEAKER_01]: peeve of mine with the whole, the whole
push for the copper wiring and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they're wrapping around the pole and
they're conducting electricity through or
[SPEAKER_01]: something or whatever the copper is
something they test for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be sticking it in your soil,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to smell copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's getting everything tested and he's
doing the leg work and making sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really love in his craft blend
is he's included malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I'm, I've been a big disciple,
I'll say of collect them as Coop or a gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, uh, he was, he was the one that
kind of turned me on to not only weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, but the, uh, the malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you don't see the malted barley in
a lot of those mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really, um, what got me to go
towards craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank, thank you for that quick side
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, back, back to your, uh,
your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I usually will give it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a top dress right when it flips
over because it's still, it's the bolt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going to be growing
vegetatively for three weeks, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give it that nutrition,
that's a little bit of a slow digest and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of fast digesting stuff at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's going to make sure that
that nutrition is there for the plant when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's my strategy for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I were to top dress anything
else throughout the cycle, it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe right around week three to week
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might do one more top dress,
but, um, something with more potassium in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, something that's a potassium heavy,
uh, supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be that balloon blend that I
have, uh, that has that, or it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: just a, um, a single mineral, like,
uh, like a Kayfoss or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, right now what I'm using is that
that bloom blend that I got from Chris
[SPEAKER_01]: over at, uh, country roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another one that I really like a lot
is, um, for like what I call emergency
[SPEAKER_01]: situations, what I have, what I on deck or
just in, in my tool belt is Brandon Rust
[SPEAKER_01]: from Okashi Earthworks has his,
uh, humate fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a, a nitric, there's,
there's, there's a three part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, a nitrogen bay or a heavy
nitrogen one, which is the A, I'll call it
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that's in the middle of the B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's one at the end at C,
which is more, the C is a more higher in
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, less in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one in the middle is just half
and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't really need to buy the one in
the middle if you've got the first two or
[SPEAKER_01]: the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have any phosphorous content?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the, yes, they all have the,
um, this is going off of memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure how accurate it is,
but, uh, I'll try and get Brandon on here
[SPEAKER_01]: sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon would be the one to ask for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the nitrogen, the one, uh,
in veg has a little bit more nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's got like a base.
[SPEAKER_01]: It covers all your bases as well,
but it's a little bit heavy on the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas on the opposite end of the things,
potassium is a little bit higher with low
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen when you go into flowering,
just so you're not suppressing your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your bud sites, uh, with heavy nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that, it sounds very
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, you're, you're trying to
simplify your life at home and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and making it as easy as possible for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and with the sip container,
um, how often do you feel as though you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watering throughout the flowering cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm watering, um, some, well, usually it
depends on the plant, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, very common for me to water every
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant will get water every other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in there every day, depending on the
plant, how the plant's drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I've had plants have to have
water every day and that's, when I say
[SPEAKER_01]: water, I water at least a gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're drinking at least a gallon a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bigger sized plants, but as far as
how do I decide whether it's time to water
[SPEAKER_01]: or not, it's really easy for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause those sip containers have a watering
tube that passes through the soil block
[SPEAKER_01]: and goes all the way down into the water
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can take a flashlight and look
down that tube and actually look into the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the water reservoir and see, do I see
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do, if I see water, I will not,
I will not water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I, if I see it's dry, I'll,
I'll add water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I do that, instead of just
keeping it topped off, I used to keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: topped off every day, just keep watering
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, overflow where it'll, I can,
you know, catch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could water until I saw water come
out and know that the, know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir is full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's important to have a
layer, the way that the sip containers are
[SPEAKER_01]: designed as you have a water reservoir,
you have some kind of, uh, a table or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call it, a layer to
hold the, the soil block above the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, then you have your soil block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, between that table and the,
and the water, as the water drains down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have air, you have air exchange going
through that tube, that tube that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the water is low enough, um,
you're getting air exchange in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the superpowers
we'll say of a sip containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting more air exchange at the
root level because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you are in a traditional pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I kind of take advantage of
that by letting that pot get completely
[SPEAKER_01]: dry so that the air level gets bigger,
bigger and bigger before I put more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because even when those, those resses
are completely dry, if you were to go over
[SPEAKER_01]: and pick up that, that planter,
it's still heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a dry back without having
to reduce the available water to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, a lot of these,
a lot of these practices seem to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in terms of like, uh, hydroponic
irrigation practices in cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I'm sure we're going to get into that
here in a second with the tricone forge,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, versus having, uh, an organic soil
where you really need to maintain that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture content so that the microbial and
biological activity maintains at a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not killing that off and having
other adverse effects where nutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer available to the plants due to
the, the nutrient cycling processes that
[SPEAKER_00]: require all that extra moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it, it seems as though by
introducing all this air to the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you are kind of mimicking a dry back
cycle, especially if it's daily,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just getting it into a good
circadian rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I water, I don't water through
that tube either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like for the same reason I like to water
through the soil block, because if you,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you, even in a traditional circle pot,
if you water it in it, in the water builds
[SPEAKER_01]: up, if you just watch the water drop,
you know, drain into the pot, into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and a million of us, I'm sure
listening or whatever have seen that
[SPEAKER_01]: because we sit there and watch the water
drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as the water drains into the media,
it's actually pulling air down with it
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also doing this air exchange that
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, by me doing the way that I'm doing
it, I'm doing it for that reason is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to just like get that air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get oxygen to the roots and
try to have as most healthy roots as I can
[SPEAKER_01]: have, because, um, if you have healthy
roots, 90% of your game is, is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are you watching?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're watering through the top,
the entire cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a mulch layer of some kind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I use the mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I harvest the plant and I take and
I debug it, debug it, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: I take all the buds off and I have the
skeleton of the plant left is just the
[SPEAKER_01]: stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take and cut that into about one inch
sections with my shears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mulch is the, uh, all of the
previous grows.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a good, good use of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it seems like, uh, you know,
I've heard like Steve Reisner talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how he has like a dual planting,
uh, or a dual substrate system with his,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dual root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go with, uh, with his aquaponic
production, where you have like that
[SPEAKER_00]: terrestrial media up top, and then you
have the, the aquaponic, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: high, high nutrient load, uh, water below
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it almost sounds like by watering
through, you're pulling nutrients out and
[SPEAKER_00]: where a lot of people, you know,
I would like, whenever I give advice for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are growing organics,
I always say, make sure you're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff or at least not a lot of runoff
because you don't want to reduce that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient load capacity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it sounds like by just letting
that go into the reservoir and letting the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots go down into that reservoir,
you're just giving them their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own sort of, uh, dual root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, uh, almost like a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're pushing water through it and
it's just sitting at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's getting any of that mineral that
washes the water soluble stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's going to collect down in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to get drawn right back
up by the roots into the, into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the microbes are going to do
the heavy lifting as far as holding the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil together because they create those
exudates around themselves to kind of glue
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves in place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be, I'd be really curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever, um, pulled any of the,
the liquid at the bottom of one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: sip containers and tested the pH or the
electrical conductivity just to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, uh, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but, um, in an organic situation,
the pH is, is more driven by the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil pH of the media than it is the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could adjust the water pH to
whatever I want, but the soil is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: change, change that pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as soon as I do so it's the minerals,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the minerals that changes pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm putting water with no minerals
in it, it's not going to change the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all those minerals composition that's
in that media block.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to determine the pH of what's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if I push water through,
I might be able to capture some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals and get a weird pH at the bottom
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking out loud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the point of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm just really curious because that's
such a, you know, like with, with things
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, let's say with Rockwell,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's so, uh, sterile, there's
absolutely nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's zero cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so everything that the plant gets is,
is, uh, a requisite on, on what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into your nutrient solution and
what the, the, the water within them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, within the substrate is,
um, versus, you know, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're not the first person that
I've heard say this, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with organics, like you, you don't really
have to care about the pH that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in as long as you have a very
biologically active substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because the, yeah, the exudates of the
plant roots as well as the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction with those microbes and
stuff is going to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, as well as you got
gypsum in there, that's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got sulfur or sulfates in there of
other kinds like magnesium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is a little bit of a acidic pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got like, um, yeah,
like nitrates will make it more acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think phosphates make it a little
bit more base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in some cases I might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, it's just really interesting
to see the kind of the two ends of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of needing to be so precise with
hydroponics versus being able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: almost this laissez faire attitude about
pH and electrical conductivity with
[SPEAKER_00]: organics that, you know, I can see how a
home grower or in a home grow situation
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning towards an organic based media,
especially for new growers can really
[SPEAKER_00]: simplify some of these almost where it's a
scientific practice where you have to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of understand the information behind the
practice before you can adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also another thing about it is,
is that my best analogy for, for it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's like, for me growing organically
is like driving a, a nice big boat of a
[SPEAKER_01]: car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just take it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a nice, relaxed ride and
it's hard to oversteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard to oversteer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you get into cocoa or you're
getting into DWC or something or NFT or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now hydroponics, you are, you're
driving a race car, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one little overcorrection and
you're in a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not, it's not you doing,
you know, half that speed and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might get in a little bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, it's, it could be a more dire
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I spill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love growing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I love all aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I still do both, you know,
I love the organics for its hands off
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus I literally could skip,
I could skip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could skip water in my garden if
I wanted to, and it'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it, done it for two,
three days and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, um, you know, it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get the best results
doing that, but good luck doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, in a, uh, cocoa grow in a similar
situation, especially when you're pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: ECs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, above 3.0, like, um, I, I we're
currently running 4.5 EC, uh, input at
[SPEAKER_00]: the, this place that I help manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants have never looked
healthier, but we have 1500 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 1250.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, we have 1250 PPFD at canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have precision irrigation controls,
environmental controls, the whole nine
[SPEAKER_00]: yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I, even when I start other
people, people off on a program that's
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to mine, if they have CO2,
if they have high PPFD, I'll still start
[SPEAKER_00]: them only at like 2.5, 3.0, because I
don't know if they're like actually
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring their runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're actually able to
monitor their substrate EC and see the
[SPEAKER_00]: trends up and down in the pore water
electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so it's, it's almost,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a race car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is operating at peak performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you mess something up, you're
fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dramatic way, usually in a dramatic
way, but in terms of hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen flower look better,
you know, like the nutrient package is so
[SPEAKER_00]: high that it can assimilate everything
that it needs to into the, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, um, like Liebig's law, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if you have a, uh, a limiting
factor, then that's the, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest that the rest of the plant can
operate at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you have low magnesium,
the plant is not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same rate that it would with adequate
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means your nitrogen load,
if it's super high, it's not all being
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a potassium, phosphorus,
sulfate, everything, if it's at a high
[SPEAKER_00]: level, it's only being able to be used at
the, the rate of the, um, the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: common denominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in an organic situation where the
plants kind of picking and choosing like a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice buffet, what it wants at that time,
you have like a huge buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that buffer comes at the cost of
space, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to use a really big, you have to
use a really big battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're putting all your nutrients at one
time into that media pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so that's your trade off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your trade off when it comes to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speed, like the, the growing organic
plant as opposed to growing a plant with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, I don't care that I'm sure I'm
going to get arguments from people and I
[SPEAKER_01]: won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't ever hear the end of it,
but I'm sorry, a synthetic plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: a synthetically fed plant is just faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get it faster through veg,
get it into flower faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see someone try and argue
against that honestly, because like you
[SPEAKER_00]: have commercial experience, uh,
now at multiple places, you own your own
[SPEAKER_00]: place and you run it and it's,
and you chose not to go organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I, I feel like we've
touched enough on the home grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic aspect of what you do as a
hobbyist and a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go into the trichome forge now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, help, help, uh, bridge that
gap of what made you decide to go
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what your practices are there,
uh, cause, uh, like let's do the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing, cloning veg into
flowering, what your flowering cycles look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, uh, the trichome forge was born
from, uh, from me and my, my best friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: big phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the owner of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping him on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but, uh, yeah, it's, it's on his
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so we're both working right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are you going to do when you're
working in a grow with other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to talk and you can just
shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are we talking about growing a
lot of the times and like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would you do if you could just do
whatever you wanted in your grow room?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it was, it was honestly
born.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so what we did was we kind of
modeled a grow, a home grow on the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial place that we were working on
and then made adjustments to it that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like anyone where they work
somewhere, they're like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can make this better if we just did
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in your own grow, you're that guy
and you get to make that decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went with PVC walls instead of FRP
walls, which means that, uh, it's two
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces of flat PVC with like almost like
it looks like cardboard, but made out of
PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, uh, and they come in panels about
two, about maybe 18 inches wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, but like 14 foot tall,
cause we got the lot tall rooms and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they just tongue and groove in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We installed them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put a bead of silicone caulk between
every panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you'll be able, you can just sit
there with a hose and spray them if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing in there that will
ever mold because it's PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and you're watertight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that first and it's white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't even have to worry about
painting it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already the right color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be reflective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so with Trichome Forge, we have a two
flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we've completely built out one
flower room in the veg and the dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what we have left to complete is where
we've got a second flower room that is
[SPEAKER_01]: like 99% complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to like hang the lights and get
some tables in there and get some,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we need some electricity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that will be done by the end of
this year for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, we have a small room for
hash still for processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what our end goal is, is we got the
veg room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have flower room A, the one that we're
using right now is our phenol heart room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will, everything that gets flowered in
so far, this has been the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that gets flowered out in there
came from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new, it's a new phenome or
phenome hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the flower room too, is what we
selected from those, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the selected phenomes, the ones that we
wanted as keepers, we're going to run
[SPEAKER_01]: those as like a monocrop or maybe,
you know, it's only two tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe one table of one and one of the
other or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many lights per room?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's two, four by eight tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: In each room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, in the veg room, it's,
uh, the, the both flower rooms are exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the same size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I w I should have got baked on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he'd give you all the dimensions and
everything, but, uh, I can do another one
[SPEAKER_00]: with him too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, um, but then, uh, the flat,
the bedroom is about one and a half times
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we did that was we have a
bunch of space to hold genetics because we
[SPEAKER_01]: know we're going to do a lot of phenome
hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed a place for all these extra
clones that we're holding up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every female that we have in there,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we make our selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we have a little bit extra bigger
veg space on purpose to be able to just
[SPEAKER_01]: hold genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and our whole strategy too,
is we're not harvesting for flowers so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do harvest some flower out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the vast majority of what's
harvested is harvested, fresh frozen to
[SPEAKER_01]: make concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it, it end game.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be able to make that
concentrate right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a, uh, a buddy making our
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us who does a fucking awesome job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we want to have the, the hashrim
in house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, we can wash the wash it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can press it and, you know,
have our dry, uh, have our freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now we still got to,
um, finish out the second flower room
[SPEAKER_01]: before we worry about that hashrim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the end game of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so we modeled it pretty much after
what we were already doing at,
[SPEAKER_01]: at Mitten Canico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we use cocoa and.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use the same, uh, feeding
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, they've switched.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Mitten Canico, they're using Athena,
but we're, we're using Canna nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we originally started
using at Mitten Canico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both me and him have always liked
Canna nutrients as far as the results we
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've hated the cost of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at you Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, love the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the, uh, what's the nutrient lineup
for Canna?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never personally used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about it, but I never actually
looked into it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Canna A and B, uh, there's a
cocoa specific variety, uh, a line of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a Canna cocoa A, Canna cocoa B
that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a, um, risotonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use, uh, Cannazyme, which is just an
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, we might use a boost like
boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most expensive thing that they
sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, boost is something that you add
during the flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give you some PK basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use, we also use mammoth pea in
there still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as a micro, because it's just
undeniable results, even in synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tested it time and time again and
mammoth pea is so fucking worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what the hell else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that's, I think that's all
we're using right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, our, uh, Grandmaster level is
coming out with some nutrients too,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be probably trying
those and those were also, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least I'm told I haven't tried them
yet, but I've been told by Grandmaster
[SPEAKER_01]: level that they're very similar to Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see, but it's a dry nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're excited for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not water-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use, we use dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using a JR crop tech for a while
and, uh, we're, uh, transitioning over to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, drip hydro for the flower formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just seems to run a little bit cleaner
right now, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only been running it for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you mixing it yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we, we, uh, we make up stock tank
barrels and then use a Dosatron rack with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we got three different recipes on it
and, uh, pump those into the rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the reservoirs all run off of,
uh, leader pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so everything's just set up on a
solenoid system, open sprinkler,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, running for each of the zones and for
the, uh, the fill programs and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, I never thought that I could run
this many plants with only two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's crazy how efficient it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are you, are you guys using,
uh, hand watering drip irrigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're, uh, we're still hand
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's been a slow build, uh,
because we kind of financing this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves and we can, but yes,
end game is we'd like to at least have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that would like, give me a cone
bottom red.
[SPEAKER_01]: As in a pump and at least let me come over
and flip a switch to water, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a zone or a table or something all at once
instead of me hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put it on a, put, put the pump on a,
uh, on like one of those, uh, Alexis
[SPEAKER_00]: switches or something that you can just
control from your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put a little, uh, a little camera
inside the flower room that's close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot line so you can see your emitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watering from your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I sometimes them like I get home after
work and I'll be like, shit, I needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just hop on, adjust it from,
from home on smoking a bowl or something
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that it's all set and ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's just such a huge weight off
the shoulders of what it used to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you had to make sure everything was
set so perfectly before you left the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guy that it's automated,
you know, I've got the pump running and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's water and I'm walking in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at every emitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making sure I don't got a plugged
emitter or something because it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have a reason to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, I feel like it does help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like you can't be so hands off
that you're not looking in the rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to miss something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely like clogged emitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything looks fine for four
or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let's like, let's say you got two
emitters per pot and one of them goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down, the plant's still looking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a week later, all of a sudden
it's trooping and it's behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at the very least it's like half the
size of everything else around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the size and extra triked out by like
week five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just like, what's going on with
this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, getting these
crazy drybacks and EC spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another hard thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have automation, it's a hard
thing to get every plant to still want to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed at the same time or water at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost have to force it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa is nice that you can just,
okay, you're going to drink whether you
[SPEAKER_01]: need it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to push out what's in there
and then you're going to get the good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people, you can still,
I still want to put it out there anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still overwater cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let people think that you can't
overwater cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about, cause I, I feel like one
of the things that I hear for with cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: users is they say, you know, from the time
you transplant that seed in or that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone in, you can just water it every
day to run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I feel like you can do that
as soon as you give it that first dryback.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, like it, it does,
it doesn't root in as hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like, I, you just kind of lose
that, that turgor of that first dryback
[SPEAKER_00]: for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like the, just the uptake of nutrients
seems to be greater if you give it,
[SPEAKER_00]: drybacks in between being fully saturated
at field capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot to be said too,
is like what I, I really think that a
[SPEAKER_01]: dryback is a very slight stress to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, it's an encouragement too,
at the same time in my, in my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, okay, for the plants getting a
little bit dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to trigger some root growth
because it needs to find water in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I haven't read that in the
scientific paper, to say that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think a little bit of dryback before
it starts shutting down to try to conserve
[SPEAKER_01]: all of its water for it to dry back last
too hard, it can definitely be a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the stress starts going
into the, you know, on the, on the
[SPEAKER_01]: proverbial needle, it's into the red now,
but I think it's a good stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, multiple, multiple studies
will actually, I'm sure come out within
[SPEAKER_01]: the years to prove it that, that little
bit of a dryback is like a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: stressor for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, it's a, it's a perceived
drought, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like they still have water
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think in, in, in Rockwell,
they have water available up to like 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: volumetric water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Coco, it's like 15 or 10,
depending on the electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, you can get really dry and
they still have water and they'll still be
[SPEAKER_00]: fine, but they're going to like perceive
it as a stressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can get sort of that,
that flowering or generative growth steer
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in like, that's how you would refer to
it in a crop steering and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, yeah, I feel like you're
absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very positive reaction in most
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a fair amount of cases where
you're going to get like this huge issue
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to arise from too much of a
dryback or too many successive drybacks
[SPEAKER_00]: that are extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which might just be salt buildup at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like what you said about like
the roots hunting for the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where I see that
initial dryback, like you transplant your
[SPEAKER_00]: clone, um, you, you irrigate it fully to
run off and then you, you let,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it like grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots are cause you know,
the roots are using what's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, there's going to be some,
uh, water movement, um, across the media,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the roots are still going to be
searching for the, the best air to water
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as they're just going to move out
to fully colonize that pot really rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's probably going to go to the areas
where the it's less root density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's root ball because that's where
it's going to be sitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cause there's no roots to suck it up
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's yeah, I can't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so when, uh, like throughout all of
your experience, cause now it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you started in 2008 and it's 2025 now,
then you've been growing for 17 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what do you think were some of the
biggest learning experiences that you had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and let's make it a two parter where
you, uh, tell us what was like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big setback that you learned from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was a big success that you
learned from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the big one here's a common
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a lot of people share this one
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not too, but it was for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we just had this topic come up on
cheap homegrown, not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for me, it's just like when you're
curing, when I was curing my cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was, um, because I was reading all
these, there's so much information online
[SPEAKER_01]: and how much of it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know until we try things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it was a timing to get it off
of the, uh, plant after it's been hanged,
[SPEAKER_01]: drying and get it into the glass and,
uh, seal it up and come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I came back, I was, I was trying
to get to the point where like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think the idea is to try to get it
as, as wet as pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to make it more wet,
but I'm saying try to get it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the wettest point I can get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still turns out good because that's
going to be the slowest cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's at more water to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, is you go up to against
the edge to where you put it in too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and what happened to me was,
uh, you know, I opened up, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I'd put into a jar and it
was completely molded out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point you can't smoke any of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just ruined, you know, for me,
that's probably an ounce, ounce and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: in that jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something when, you know,
you take at least three months,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least three months, probably for me at
that time, it was probably four months at
[SPEAKER_01]: least, uh, of, of growing and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add on a couple of weeks of
drying and, uh, you just threw it all away
[SPEAKER_01]: or it's devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's devastating, but at the same time,
it's something that you don't ever forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you're not going to make that
same mistake again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost invaluable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost pays for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those times, when you're frustrated
with yourself, think of that, think like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what can I learn from this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at least there's some value there
and you don't feel like so much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're finding something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a failure if you don't learn
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one right there is, I mean,
that's an ounce of product that's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that one was a tough one for me,
but I think the biggest, um, I guess I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: call it a setback, but it wasn't at,
but I thought, I thought it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: was, uh, when I, the way I left Mitten
Canico, I still left Mitten Canico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but the short end of the story on,
on that was, was that, um, at the time in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state of Michigan, there was a push by
a lot of the big MSO multi-state
[SPEAKER_01]: operating, um, corporations and things
where they were actually paying lobbyists
[SPEAKER_01]: to change the law in the regulation,
um, to basically make it way harder for
[SPEAKER_01]: the home grower, make it way harder for
caregivers and the, you know, they looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at those people as competition and,
uh, in the commercial space, it's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't agree with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lobbied hard against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people in Michigan lobbied
hard against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we ultimately defeated that
agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during that, there was a boycott list
that was started and it was spread a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, this was a list of companies
that, um, directly we found evidence of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, affiliated with that lobby and that
lobby group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one of the, uh, dispensaries that
was a customer that the CEO of our
[SPEAKER_01]: company, the owner of our company,
Mitten Canico was selling to that
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary unbeknownst to me for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was in the flower room and,
um, him and another employer had mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: something about that company name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, wait a minute, what about that
company?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, we just had some flower go to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I thought you weren't
messing with companies like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they laughed it off and that didn't
make me happy, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought about it for a little while
and I decided, no, I, I know myself too
[SPEAKER_01]: well, and that's not going to make me a
happy situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just one of those times in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you know, right and wrong,
you need, you gotta make a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I walked away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, I, I, I went to the owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the owner and I said,
look, this is going to be my two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't work for you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I can't work for you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't work for a company that supplies
people that I don't believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so that are actively lobbying
against the practices that you find to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the most valuable, valuable to the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobbying against home grow and caregivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I can't support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, um, long story short,
I walked away from that job because we
[SPEAKER_01]: just didn't see eye to eye on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, uh, I, at the time I,
I felt like that was a huge setback,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, oh, now what, you know,
what am I supposed to do now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just got a normal job doing normal
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I thought pretty much my whole
career was over in the field, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I just kept doing what I do and talked
about cannabis and growing cannabis and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, an opportunity with my, he was a good
friend at the time, uh, grand master level
[SPEAKER_01]: at Thomas at grand master level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he reached out to me and he said,
Hey, we want to have a warehouse in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you could, uh, help us out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, do you have a background in
logistics or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that seems like such a huge,
yeah, in Michigan, a lot of the jobs that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had, uh, have, there's a lot of
manufacturing here in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the jobs that I've had is in,
in manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always seem to, in factories,
and I always seem to, no matter where I
[SPEAKER_01]: start, I'd always end up shipping and
receiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a lot of, uh, I do have a lot
of experience in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that did help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's definitely combining like a
skill and a passion that, uh, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people look for in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really cool that you were able to
find that, you know, it's almost like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you feel like all the doors are shut
and then, uh, one just opens up and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, damn, this is a nice door to walk
through right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within that first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's, uh, I've been to now around
the world, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never left the country other than I did
go to Canada in high school, I think for
[SPEAKER_01]: watch a play or something, but I mean,
he sent me to Barcelona for a span of this
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ICBC, uh, sent me to Berlin the
month after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then, then we went to, we just got
back, uh, from December in Vegas at the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, MJ BizCon, my first time ever in
Vegas, my first time ever at MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all because of the
opportunities of working with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Grandmaster LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's dope to him because,
uh, he's made my life awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should see if he wants to come in and
talk about his growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, he is like such a huge stickler
for making sure that his grow is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, he's an absolute grower than
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen him tear down more grows than I
think I've seen him complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just at least the way that he was for
a while showing it through Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just seemed like it wasn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, I'm not doing this round and I'm
restarting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't play around, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is like, and I think that's,
that's why I'm so, um, happy to work for
[SPEAKER_01]: him because I know that the product is the
same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's on the phone to the endless
hours to make sure that the product is
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the way he wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't care if that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not an engineer to make things that
aren't possible possible because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what he wants and it needs to work his
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a good trait for somebody
who's designing a product that's supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be bulletproof in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, it's some pretty,
pretty, you know, high, some pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme environments, in my opinion,
some of the heats that, uh, these LEDs,
[SPEAKER_01]: lights have to sit in and get sprayed on
and everything else is still team to work
[SPEAKER_01]: day in, day out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be pretty surprising, uh,
what they can make it through,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some things already.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I mean, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, finding a good led supplier is so
crucial nowadays that, uh, I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: personally tried the, um, the grand master
level LEDs, but lately we've been really
[SPEAKER_00]: digging, uh, spec grade LEDs cause they
are just, they are bulletproof and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat output on them is, is crazy good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, everything seems to flower so
nicely under their spectrum too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really gotten much into spectrum
tuning, but, uh, you know, maybe in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, that's something that's in my,
in my pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so with those as your setbacks and
what you've learned from them and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of came through that, that,
that's an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, what about in terms of a
success that you found where it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, maybe it was an, a happy accident,
um, or, uh, something that was purposeful
[SPEAKER_00]: that just either changed your perspective
on growing or that you just were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you learned something so valuable from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still being used in your garden
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to say just my, for one,
my idolizing, I guess, maybe it got to
[SPEAKER_01]: that point at one point, uh, of,
uh, collect them as Coot and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: his teachings because I love his no
nonsense approach and he doesn't mince
[SPEAKER_01]: words about, you know, how he feels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, nobody in the room wonders how
he feels about something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I love that in this industry
where it's kind of been in the secret for
[SPEAKER_01]: so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there's so many pay walls or so
many, uh, wise tales will say on some
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's great to see somebody who's all
about just truth and honesty and what is
[SPEAKER_01]: just easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just grow some weed and not,
not make it difficult for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that relationship, I learned
about worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, you get your own,
your own worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you automatically gain points with
me when you say things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's the, that's the secret
sauce that yeah, there is the science and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read multiple books on it that tells
you why it does the things it does,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't need to know at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need to know is that if you start
your own worm bin and a quick Google
[SPEAKER_01]: search will give you good advice on how to
do a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the product of that worm bin is,
is like magic to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like one of the number one things
I'll do on a plant that I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going on with this plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I know it's some kind of a nutrient
deficiency or something, I'm going right
[SPEAKER_01]: to the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's a, that's the easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just pull up a worm castings,
water it in, wait a couple of days and
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see if it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it getting worse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but for me, worm castings nine out of
10 times just work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have an idea, but I mean,
I don't, I can't specifically tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I was having a magnesium deficiency
and there just so happened to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria in the worm casting that helps
liberate the magnesium that was already
[SPEAKER_01]: locked up in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that the plant could take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you all of that because I
didn't do a soil test or any, or a leafs
[SPEAKER_01]: of leafs, uh, pace test or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I can tell you is I put some worm
castings on it and the plant got way
[SPEAKER_01]: better looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes the secret sauce is the
secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't have to know what's
what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to know it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, and, and worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't use it at all on my indoor
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, I just am strictly hydroponic at
home even because I just, it, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps me hone my skills for the
commercial grow as well, just to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm, I'm continuing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I'm even like, I'm planning on
doing some tomatoes that way this year
[SPEAKER_00]: too, just to see what, how, how productive
they can actually be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, on everything else
hitting them with worm castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, especially on tomatoes or anything
like that, I always find that like calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: and magnesium are the things that I always
run into an issue of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to get those, like the brown
spots, uh, on the ends of the tomatoes or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that's why when you ask me about my
organic practices, um, it's usually worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings and gypsum, because that brings
you in the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also brings sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gypsum for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm throwing that on all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes just will put some in my,
uh, in my worm bin too, and let them work
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they don't seem to mind having that
little extra grit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they need a little grit in their
guts to make sure everything gets through
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, you know, man, this has been
really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've loved talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I could just keep going on and
on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: About, uh, just the different aspects of
your growing style and, and the choices
[SPEAKER_00]: that you make in both, uh, uh,
cultivators mindset where you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this for like a specific goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also, you know, as a home
grower and a caregiver where you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it for a specific outcome of like what
that medicine is going to be for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for you or for whoever you're providing it
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I'm going to try and,
uh, get into some of these last few
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, uh, start to, to get towards a
wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, so having worked, uh,
in both the cultivation industry on a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial scale, as well as helping,
um, venture into it with your friend baked
[SPEAKER_00]: poem, and then being a home grower and a
caregiver, you know, all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: badges that you wear, where would you like
to see the cultivation industry go in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of, uh, what do you think needs to
change for, for the cultivation industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, as a whole, you know, home grow,
uh, commercial all things in between?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that the, I think that
ultimately the biggest thing that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: love to see change is, um, in the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all of us spend a lot of time
online in, in our little communities,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is normal for us humans to separate
into little groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we get into the points where
we're like, we're both organic gardeners
[SPEAKER_01]: and garden and arguing over who's more
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, come on guys, we're all really
a minority still in the, uh, in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the grand scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, even you walk down the streets,
you know, it's not, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, you know, the vast majority of people
walking down the streets smoking on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still not as accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all part of the same group guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to stop the little bit of
infighting and stop the, the need to
[SPEAKER_01]: separate ourselves out into little groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I just wish there was not that
there isn't because there's awesome,
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome people in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been blessed to meet many of
them, but I want that for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I want that for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if we, as cannabis users,
cannabis growers, just our good human
[SPEAKER_01]: beings, uh, and also smoke cannabis,
that right there does a lot for the
[SPEAKER_01]: movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That right there, you know, you know,
it could be something like somebody says,
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's talking trash on cannabis and
somebody's talking trash on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody in the conversation could be
like, wait, my neighbor smokes cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and he shovels my fucking driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when it snows too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that just, you don't have to
be like, I, I get into it because I get to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to these protests and stuff and I can,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get people wanting to, you know,
get a little bit more aggressive about it
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, but you get a lot more,
you get a lot further with honey sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: than you do with, uh, with, uh,
I can't remember the, uh, expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: More flies with honey with vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a time and place, I guess,
for a little bit of vinegar, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, keep it to your firmness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and also, you know, like I
totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, uh, bringing the community
together, uh, as, as a whole, rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: fragmenting into different encampments,
uh, would help, uh, I feel like reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma overall, because I feel like when,
when you look from the outside at a,
[SPEAKER_00]: at a group, let's say, um, and you see in
fighting within that group, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to take what is then being,
um, publicized, whether it be a political
[SPEAKER_00]: agenda or a social movement or otherwise
as being valid, because you start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: these people, you're like, they can't even
decide what they want to do, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so how do we, how are we supposed to
view them from the position of not being
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it's a, it's, in some cases,
it's a little bit of a bad look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we need to definitely break down some
of those internal barriers that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like growers and consumers and even
just people who love the idea and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the community of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we just, we definitely need to come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that the entire,
uh, community could benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so a lot of new growers face pitfalls
and as the cheap home grow, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the growing with my fellow
growers, you, you run into a lot of new
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and that's one of the first
podcasts I listened to as a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like so many other people,
uh, listened to it to try and glean
[SPEAKER_00]: little, um, insights and other,
uh, tidbits of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so what do you feel as though,
uh, if, if you were to put yourself in
[SPEAKER_00]: that category of a new grower,
knowing what you know now, what would be
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the advice you would give to
yourself or to new growers in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I would, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give the same advice that was
given to me when I, when I first started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, I kept, I can't remember who
exactly first said it to me, but it stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, um, I was asking,
it was an old girl or somebody,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was asking, you know, what,
what's a good tip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a good tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, just be patient,
learn to be patient, be a patient person.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many times in growing where you
want to freak out about, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you come back the next day after doing
nothing and it's completely fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's times where it's the opposite
of that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, so, so for me to have a little
patience with my grow, um, and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, uh, hard for some people that was
hard for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the people that would look at
every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I wanted to measure it or see how much
it grew and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I've, as I've matured in both life
and as a grower, I've learned to step away
[SPEAKER_01]: more than, than be on top of things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, being patient for me in the
garden, especially for me in the curing
[SPEAKER_01]: process and the drying process process,
it's just helped me up my game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel, uh, tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's good to be vigilant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to, uh, to care and to love your
plant, but you can over love your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and do too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so have a little bit of patience,
I think I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I think that that's,
uh, that's the second answer that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten as, as patients being the advice to
give to a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, uh, it's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even, you know, it's a kind of the
common, uh, trope of always telling people
[SPEAKER_00]: two more weeks when they're looking at
their flowering cycle, uh, just to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that they get to the end of it and
they're satisfied with their harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not rushing the dry, not rushing the
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but so much of that does come with
practice and repetition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels as though I feel like
patience is almost guaranteed after a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like if, if you can't have
patience at first, you need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: perseverance so that you make it through
those harvests and all those, those
[SPEAKER_00]: fuckups and, uh, you know, issues that you
run into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's the best teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about it earlier as,
you know, don't, don't worry about the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuckups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ask yourself when you do fuck up,
what's the lesson in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those are the last of the main
questions that I have, but I do like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of the, uh, ubiquitous podcast
wrap up questions because, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, uh, I feel like it's
important just to round out the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, what was the first time you
ever smoked cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even recall the first time I
smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it could be the most memorable of the
early experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I got high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, because I smoked it many times
before that, as I was a case of fun fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew cannabis before I smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that was for, uh, being a
caregiver and for my uncle and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never smoked it at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: After, after I saw, did you say why?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I said, no way that you're the first
person that, uh, grew before they smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I am ever the first
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: First on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was, it was when I saw what
it did for my uncle that it convinced me
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, this is, this is something
that you should probably be taking just as
[SPEAKER_01]: a maintenance thing because look what it
just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, and that's my uncle who that's
blind blood and, you know, that means I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe genetically disposed to some of the
things he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I started trying at that point,
but, uh, I would smoke bowls and joints
[SPEAKER_01]: and bongs and never feel felt anything
like hold it for as long as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever, all the different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never really felt like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was late in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was twenties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in my twenties at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, uh, but what the first time I
felt it was, uh, basically an overdose and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was an edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate a, uh, I made, I had made one of the
things I like to do as a caregiver is make
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles around Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I made was a
brownie, but I made them in little loaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: little loafs and I got it right out,
right when it came out of the oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was hot and juicy and oh,
it was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ate a whole loaf of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't really, you know,
get effects from it before, but my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: then after I ate the whole thing,
I realized that ate the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was almost like an automatic
thing or just chewing on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to eat only half,
but you know, he just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a psychological factor
when you eat a specific ratio of fat to
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, where you're, if you don't
consciously stop yourself from eating,
[SPEAKER_00]: your mind will not stop you from eating
even past the point of being full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a, it's this like a
psychological thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe no surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ate this thing and later I did
the math and it was upward of a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like, you know,
maybe a little bit changed lower,
[SPEAKER_01]: but so it was, it was nighttime and I had
laid down and I'd started feeling like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, I'm starting to feel high,
almost like drunkenness a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to lay down to maybe I'll
just fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, then it just kept getting
stronger and stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the room started spinning,
like literally like the room started
[SPEAKER_01]: spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like the feeling that I get
right before I'm going to puke,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so I'm laying there,
the room was spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I turned the lights, the light,
the little nightlight on, and that gives
[SPEAKER_01]: me something to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can stop the room from spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like this almost, almost like a
psychedelic experience in that it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: all this happened in my mind, but what I
experienced was like kind of floating
[SPEAKER_01]: through space around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how else to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than I knew for a fact that like
this glass like material in front of me
[SPEAKER_01]: was my consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it like shattered a bunch of different
pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I mean, I felt the same as
I do sitting in this chair, but I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was formless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have arms and legs and stuff,
but I somehow like with my mind just out
[SPEAKER_01]: of pure will was like pulling these pieces
back together, like trying to get them all
[SPEAKER_01]: to go back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the strange thing is, is I didn't get
them all back before, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back to, or whatever, coming back
to this plane or whatever, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did I leave behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting, but I had a hell of a
cotton mouth, so thirsty, but super
[SPEAKER_01]: lethargic and could barely move my arms
without tons of concentration and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but after that, uh, just a puff of a
bowl would get me high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, like you had to jumpstart your
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I needed just a mass overdose of it
to get them to start working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was a crazy experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stuff you were smoking before
that, um, I didn't, I even did like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we had shattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dabbed before that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't, I didn't feel high from it at
all, but like you would do it with friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff and they were all getting baked
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My patients is the one that I would do
that with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, cause he was determined to get me
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, he's like, this is the
stuff you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you grow this and not even,
you know, get an effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dude, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I got some shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we smoked that and I didn't get an
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always heard like,
um, like if people smoke when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: younger, they'll say, I didn't get high
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do always wonder if it's like an,
uh, like your mind is not recognizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: feelings because it's a new feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wonder if that, if there's any
validity to that, I just think it has to
[SPEAKER_01]: be that I didn't have the receptors or
they were way, or they were covered with
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you know, another substance
that was blocking it from being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what, but the, but now I
blame, I have plenty of them for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: because, uh, definitely feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's, that's super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like not only that you grew before you
smoked, but that you like smoke ample
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of times before you ever got high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, I feel like that's very
unique, but it's, uh, that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's, uh, so, uh, back into these
last few wrap up questions, what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're, uh, some people call it the
desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Island strain or, you know, the end of the
world strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what would you need to have there if
you're the last guy on earth or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, what's your favorite of all
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the changes of it, the answer that
changes all the time that answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, I'd say right now vortex is,
is from TGA genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did so much for the, uh, the breeding
for flavor and, uh, because he had,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a lung disease and he had to smoke
only concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was really, really into like the
flavors and the vortex was such a good
[SPEAKER_01]: high on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's one of the first and only
cannabis, like buds, like flour that I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked and grained out on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like usually there's a ceiling for me with
flour and I can smoke something and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and get whatever high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I keep smoking, I'll get to the
point where I know, okay, if I keep
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking now, I'm just wasting weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm not going to get any higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where I'm going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and vortex was one of the first ones
that didn't have that ceiling as I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got higher the more I smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, until the point I got sick,
I greened out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, the room started spinning and I puked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I was happy to find, I ran across a
pack of them and have, have, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: made a couple of breeding projects of that
because I liked that strain so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did, I bred them to themselves
because I got some males and females to
[SPEAKER_01]: expand how many seeds I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I call that project V and I've passed
that out to tons of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, I've made a couple of
crosses to one with Donnie burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call that my Spartan puke, which is very
popular right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have been liking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I crossed one with an orange
strain that I had gifted to me from
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called orange dream haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I crossed that and made an orange
vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm currently hunting through that at
home slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hoping for like a, uh,
like a heavy orange terpene profile of
[SPEAKER_00]: that with some of the, uh, cause I,
I've never actually had the ability to try
[SPEAKER_00]: vortex, uh, as flower or concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure what the terpene
profile on that leans towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vortex is going to be like,
I find two main phenols and there's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be outliers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the two main ones that I find in
vortex are like a really sweet lemony kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a citrusy taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, there's another one that's
more on the foul side of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like a rotten mango kind of,
uh, uh, uh, almost baby diaper roof file.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that could be, yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, so you get those two kind of
terpene, those two kind of profiles off
[SPEAKER_01]: that vortex, but, uh, yeah, I'll,
uh, you have to just DM me a good address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you out some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it project V and basically it's
just vortex F2 and you can just hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: through and find out what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old school weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit leafier than some of the
new stuff, which is can be annoying,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, it's the effect that I like of
that string.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why a lot of people say they
smoke for flavor, which is popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll be the first one to tell you if I
have to pick one thing I want effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can eat food for flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the effect that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, uh, as a medicine,
that's probably the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like some people could even
argue though that the, uh, the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff kind of can stick, they all come
together for that entourage effect of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, but it sounds like those have
plenty of flavor to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you're kind of getting the best of
both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but yeah, with that orange,
I didn't answer your question on that
[SPEAKER_01]: orange vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, I do get, I've had people,
so I've had people reach out to me that
[SPEAKER_01]: are interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've, when I go to these events,
I also usually have some available for
[SPEAKER_01]: sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I usually ask for like 20 bucks or
something, uh, for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but people have already reported back
on that getting like, like orange,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, push push-ups or, or, or creamy and
orange kind of orange vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, that sounds really good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to find one with those kinds of
turps, but with the effect I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm looking for in that is the
orange dream haze is what I called my
[SPEAKER_01]: happy weed, like bust depression,
that, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I'm looking for that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those flavors, if it's, if it's super
heavy and like really intense,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than it being like an orange dream
sickle, it could be an orange nightmare
[SPEAKER_00]: sickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cause it, yeah, if it's going,
if potency is the end goal and then
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors, the secondary, then it sounds
like you're doing this, the stuff to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, if that's your like a vortex,
you know, I love that as an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have heard of it before,
um, whether or not they've tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, now, uh, I'm not going to assume
that, uh, TGA is, is your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, but who is your favorite breeder
of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite breeder of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to like pick a couple packs
from one breeder as what you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be running for the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a hard question because
woof, so many out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I probably, if I could just,
uh, pick anyone, yeah, I would love more
[SPEAKER_01]: subs work for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems to be, he had the same
palette as me, at least the stuff that he
[SPEAKER_01]: liked, I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool to have somebody selecting
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, his breeding, um, strategy I
loved as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he was a unicorn hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking for that unicorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants that something that the outlier,
if you grow a hundred seeds and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're way different than everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that got his attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so when I'm female hunting,
that's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for that special something
that nobody else has got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then I want everybody to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I feel like that's the breeder's
plight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're, you're looking for the
best stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the best stuff is an outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you try and breed with it,
but then it's another hunt because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the outliers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just this never ending cycle of
looking for the better and the better and
[SPEAKER_00]: the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, even with your growth style,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're always trying to knock off
the top contenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, that's, that's dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, if I, I thought you might've
said, cause it seems like you've hunted a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of his gear, uh, or skunk master flex,
um, yeah, just with all of his different
[SPEAKER_00]: burgers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's more of the influence of big
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves the, I love the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the burgers and the GMO will say it's
really GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the effect of GMO, but,
um, the flavors could be better if you ask
[SPEAKER_01]: me, I mean, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big savory guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I call my buddy a GMO because
he likes anything across the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's got so many genetics that are
across the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I mean, if you're done with it,
I could, I could see if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: straight for hash, uh, if you find an
outlier of a GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross that does have those special
terpenes that are not necessarily the most
[SPEAKER_00]: funky, but just really loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, whether it be sweet or
citrusy or, uh, fruity, or even I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: some GMO crosses that kind of like this
rotten candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that doesn't even make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if candy can rot,
but it's what it makes me think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, rotten fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if it, if it just dumps on the,
on the extraction, then I could see why
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd want to hunt that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a trichome forge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I love skunk master flex and I
love his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but honestly, we have a connection to
him already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't, I don't have no connection,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I feel that it's always what,
uh, what you can't have that almost seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like you want it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you did talk about your first,
uh, um, time getting like super baked,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of kickstarted your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like, um, I do like to ask,
like, what was your most memorable
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis related experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the answer for it,
then so be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have another, uh, just really
memorable cannabis related experience that
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't, uh, told in the story so far
today, I'll leave this, uh, this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity now for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that my most memorable cannabis
experience would be like protesting
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking cannabis where you shouldn't be
smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done that multiple places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the first time I got ballsy was the,
uh, when in 2008 was the first time that
[SPEAKER_01]: medical went legal in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's when the high times cup
started shortly after coming to Michigan
[SPEAKER_01]: once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was the third.
[SPEAKER_01]: High times cup or fourth high times cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember 12 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, I can't remember which one
it was, but it was right when,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, when recreational legal happened to
Michigan, which was I think way later,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 2012 or 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but when whatever it was, the high
times cup after rec came legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first high times cup where there
was recreational legal, the, the line was
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at, it's held at a racetrack,
which has a huge parking lot in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, and the line of that's where the
cars were parked, but the people in line
[SPEAKER_01]: to get in went through the whole parking
lot wrapped around on the side street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was about a block from the
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridiculous, but I was standing in that
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, well, you, you stand in line for
so long, you get a little bit bored and
[SPEAKER_01]: you end up breaking out the fucking weed
and start smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can still remember that there was
two guys from Ohio behind me that had
[SPEAKER_01]: driven up there and, uh, they were just so
nervous cause I kept passing them the
[SPEAKER_01]: joint just cause I just passed the wrong
people around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, dude, we're in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, and I'm just smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, literally I just put it out
and a cop had driven past and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: just like sweating bullets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, I just felt like such,
such like a King at that point is just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, come on guys, it's not, I'm not
going to stop us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was funny cause when the cops
drove by, somebody was in the passenger
[SPEAKER_01]: seat of the cop car with their camera
phone and they're like videotaping people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never heard the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never heard the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're all going to get busted and
we're like, no one's coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just putting it on their social
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're a quarter mile from the damn
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next best one was,
um, getting invited to, uh, the Michigan
[SPEAKER_01]: weasters put on a rally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started, they've done three now and
I've been to all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they asked me at the first one,
if I wanted to speak at, at, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the state capital steps in Lansing and
boy was I nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, to be able to, for one smoke on
the state capital steps, uh, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, the Michigan weasters and
everybody else, we kind of did it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstration, but then to, to then have a
podium and literally stand there in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, I get online, but I'm in
sitting in my room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's people watching,
but it's different than when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: standing there looking at those eyeballs,
looking back at you and to stand up there
[SPEAKER_01]: and to be able to get through a speech and
say what I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was huge for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, I mean, yeah, that's, that's one of
the ones that the stories that I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: you tell before that I'm always just like
so impressed by that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is a really ballsy move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you think about it, uh,
in terms of the federal legalization of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis right now and doing it on a,
um, on a governmental site, just as a form
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, like civil disobedience and
protest of, of their laws that are
[SPEAKER_00]: oppressing us as users and, um,
as, as cultivators and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, a very, um, victimless,
uh, crime at this point in so many aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: that, yeah, that's like props to you hats
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a big thing to, to do and to
be a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always very, very happy to hear that
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely a proud moment for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now doing it three years in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got speakers that are
literally lawmakers that are coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: from, from, you know, their office right
there, the big Capitol building,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're coming out and standing and
taking their turn at the podium,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is so encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's only one or two right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was zero, uh, on the first one and
we're getting more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you gotten any of them to light up
with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you, if you can't say so,
I'll just say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's enough of a mystery there for
people to want to look more into this and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe even participate a little
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's a, that's a very,
it's, it's like the next frontier,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, of like cannabis legislation is just
getting, getting out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these events and helping bring more
awareness to the, the facts that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge, uh, problem that it was made out
to be by things like reefer madness and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the, the initial, uh, like,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemp bill or whatever, where,
um, they, they had the stamps that people
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to be able to, uh, the marijuana
tax, the marijuana tax stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, yeah, we're and, but they didn't
give out these stamps, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's like all this stigma that's built
up over the years to have people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are going and actively trying to gain
rights, uh, for people is, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the biggest endeavors I feel
like we could take on right now as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, at the same time, it makes you
feel good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes you feel good when you go,
you know, a lot of times people will tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you that, uh, you're, it's not going to
change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not changing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing anything, but then,
like I said, you come in year after year
[SPEAKER_01]: and you see change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't listen to those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's the thing that you hear all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't listen to their daughters,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, if you keep showing up,
um, and you're literally on the steps and
[SPEAKER_01]: these Congress people have to walk past
you as you're talking and saying things,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, they're going to hear some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to hear some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, was there anything else that you
wanted to touch on before we wrap this up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that we didn't, uh, bring up that
you wanted to make sure we, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just wanted to, you know,
the biggest thing that I like,
[SPEAKER_01]: the message I like to get across is,
um, I usually end all my shows and sign
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say, keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is, is that
it's, it's more than just keep growing
[SPEAKER_01]: candles, keep growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it can apply to so many things
in your life and don't get stagnant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so the most precious thing for me
and why I do everything is I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: to, uh, keep people, you know,
give people the right for home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these states you'll see,
you know, and even other, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities, it'll come, come in and it
gets legalized a little bit as medical,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it goes to recreational, then medical
goes away and then home grow goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we have to protect
anything, if we have to stand up for
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, um, you don't have to stand up
for commercial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to stand up for anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, when it comes to homegrown
cannabis, there's still states in this
[SPEAKER_01]: country where it's completely legal to
walk into a store and buy commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but you can't grow it yourself,
which is more medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's a travesty in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think that, uh, if you know that
cannabis is a medicine and I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not even a shadow of a doubt anymore,
you can do a quick Google search.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's worth protecting and
keeping it so that we can do it ourselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and not be beholden to somebody else
to have to supply it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I love that it ties in so well
with the, the title of this podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keep growing because that's the
way we grow, you know, not only as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community, but, uh, that's how people get
better and how people, um, can improve
[SPEAKER_00]: individually in life is just, uh,
keep, keep working towards it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, this has been awesome,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you so much for your time and
coming on here and talking with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community is going to love this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into some really good technical
stuff and some really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For home growers and even for commercial
growers, I feel like it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much of this is a patience game and a,
um, uh, perseverance of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, Russ Spartan, thank you so
much for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
