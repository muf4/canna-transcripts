[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to the Way We Grow
podcast, a place where we're going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews with people about their
cannabis story, their journey with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, and kind of what led them to the
cannabis community, the cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: community in specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we have Chad Westport or at Chad
.Westport on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a cannabis educator, a content
creator, a breeder, and of course a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is also a sustainable agriculture
and small farm system graduate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Chad, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing awesome, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me and Gabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we do have our co-host
today, Gabby Bronstein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabby, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I got to be in the car,
but since you're running the show today,
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured we could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think it's going to work out
fine just to have you here with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also find Gabby on Instagram at
SIGabbyChemDog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am Nick Wolf, also MrWolfGrows on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so Chad, I kind of want to leave
the first part of the show open to just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of ask if there was anything that's
on your mind, cannabis growing related
[SPEAKER_02]: today that is something that's kind of
like eating at you or occupying your brain
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to see what you were
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always man, 365 days a year, 24-7,
my brain is typically on this plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: something related to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things, a lot of
directions that could go there,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be like grow technology,
whether it be like the direction of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that I always like to really
highlight, and you know, I think this is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a theme that you touch on with a
lot of your guests and throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally feel that the people who are
doing it at home, the people in the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tents, people kind of on the smaller scale
are always going to be the soul of this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, the soul of cannabis,
the people who will like move the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're facing an interesting time where
there's going to be a lot more exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot more availability, which is
great, but it's also going to come with a
[SPEAKER_01]: cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the people who are doing it for
finding that next unicorn or helping their
[SPEAKER_01]: sick neighbor, those are going to be the
people that carry it forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's always on my mind is the
home grower is always going to be the soul
[SPEAKER_01]: of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like with with what you're thinking,
you kind of brought up like unicorns are
[SPEAKER_02]: like the, you know, because people are
just always super excited about the the
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really nice looking flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, what is your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we did have a talk earlier in one
of our episodes about between Gabby,
[SPEAKER_02]: myself and Cosmic about where the next
sort of unicorns are like the elite
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars are going to come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you have an opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's probably going to
come from your your taste makers,
[SPEAKER_01]: your hit makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how a lot of the things have just
over time blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we've gotten, you know, past 2012,
once we've gotten into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, Colorado has like pretty
proper med systems and they've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen this word kind of drives me
nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the cannabis influencer,
we've seen the rise of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know I was listening to Cypress
Hill hits in the bong, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: got to end chronic the AK-47, the Alaskan
Thunder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were like the first stream names I
ever heard back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been going longer since 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the next hotness is going to
come from a taste maker, whether that has
[SPEAKER_01]: longevity or not, that's to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something with like longevity and legs,
I still think that's probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from a home grower or, you know,
a small craft grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say a small craft grower,
I'm really thinking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 or 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or less plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're going to kind of have that
longevity to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something has good medicinal effects,
if something has the qualities that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: after, that's going to stand the test of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you say taste makers,
do you think that like the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: have this branding or recognition behind
them are the ones that are finding the
[SPEAKER_02]: strains or just bringing them to the
attention of the public?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one thing that I like to think
about is like almost all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that we have that would be
considered these either hot flashes in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pans, or even if they did have those legs
that you're talking about and kept on
[SPEAKER_02]: going and were very popular, they don't
seem to ever come from the people who made
[SPEAKER_02]: them popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, you know, a lot of people have
sourced two different companies or
[SPEAKER_01]: different people within this industry that
we all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of, you know, once they
check mark it, they're kind of seal of
[SPEAKER_01]: approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it takes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just kind of basic business in
a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to have distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have the greatest product in the
world, but you have to have a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: expose people to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a way to just get it
distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where those kind of the taste
makers come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm convinced that not many of them
are the ones who actually find these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but they have enough feelers out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones we made us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was a short or
something like that where we asked the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I feel exactly the same way as
you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hopefully it's going to be a
home grower that finds the next elite,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's going to need some help marketing
it, bringing it to the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the to the masses or else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it'll never be considered elite
if people don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter if you grow the best weed
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if people don't hear about it or know
about it, if you know, it'll never have
[SPEAKER_00]: that lasting time where people recognize
that as as such an important strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I want to touch on real
fast is you mentioned cannabis influences,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to be very clear that that's
not what will and I are trying to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to tell stories and we want to be
cannabis inspirers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to inspire people to grow about
grow cannabis and think about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're not trying to be the
next influencers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not too far off, but I see what
you're trying to say, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's I think there's a big difference
between influence and inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a difference in motives
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one is kind of more
self-serving, whereas the other is really
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, propagating the good for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: The education that that's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been such an underground industry for
such a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all of a sudden, it's above ground
and we have, you know, corporate and I
[SPEAKER_01]: hate to say the term Chad's because I'm a
Chad, but I'm not that kind of Chad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a bunch of Chad's out there
that have no freaking clue about the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, but they're very good at marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people don't know the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily know the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So important to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the inspiration and like the
shows I've been watching your channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to get these stories out there
before they're just kind of like paved
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all started with, you know,
something else that I want to have any
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of cancel culture within the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that all the stories
are told and remembered something else
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to make sure we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that we early on in
the podcast, have you tell about your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast because sometimes people don't
listen all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to make sure that people
know like what you're doing today and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, like you, I'm just kind of
out there trying to share the story and
[SPEAKER_01]: education is really the hallmark of what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get people growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant has been in my life for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized after a while it's medicinal
benefits to me knowing that and knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a lot of other people out
there that could benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to get people growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what I focus on on my channel is
just different ways, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce you to different breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow at a particular style, but I'm open
to anything as long as it gets a person
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of what I do on my
channel, but I also do like to tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a series with a tad Hussie from kiss
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called dope history.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back, we interviewed a lot of
people that I think today's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're just turning 21, which is the
legal age and you're coming to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you probably don't know these people,
but they've had such an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw you guys tee shorts with Wolf
the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Gall.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, that guy has an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And funny enough, we ran the same streets
doing the exact same thing 30 years apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really fascinating because we did
just have a really like a three hour long
[SPEAKER_02]: interview with him yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may, I am a horrible self promoter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one thing I just like to have a
good time and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to help you with that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chad Westport is the name of the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chad that Westport on Instagram,
as Nick had mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a couple of the shows I do,
you know, there's a seed collector show,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I focus on just showing off seed
collections, introducing people to
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders, different strains, and maybe
some grow reports and profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe they like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also do a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the best grow show just
because long time ago diesel boy was a
[SPEAKER_01]: drum and bass DJ and he put America's
number one drum and bass DJ on a CD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wasn't, but because he put it,
it stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden now he's
America's number one drum and bass DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put it as the best grow show,
but it got a little too egotistical
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, but I'm just like,
ah, I can't say it with a straight face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just changed that to real cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real cannabis is where I have the
conversations with those craft growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: with those home growers, with again,
the people that are going to be keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: this tradition alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely sounds like we're doing similar
stuff, but I don't see it as competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it more as we help each other grow
by generating interest in these topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's such a big world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just even like strain wise
regionally, you know, we were talking a
[SPEAKER_01]: second ago about, you know, that,
that home grower needs that outlet to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of get it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like GMO is one that always just pops into
my head as an easy example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm in Washington state,
I've been part of the legal market here
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really start seeing that show up
to like 2018, 2019 out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's like, Ooh, wow,
this is the hot new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I talked to some friends in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, that's so like 2013
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need a lot of people doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need people in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're all again, from where or how
we had to operate before we were all just
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of little clicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how a lot of famous strains
started, you know, and they'd kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: move, but now we can expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I enjoy, you know, again, not looking
at it as competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just making a thicker book for
people to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we learned from each other,
you know, you know, I'll be honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten a chance to watch too
much of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched a little bit, but I'm an advid
cannabis podcast watcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I watch a ton of stuff on
the future cannabis project, the first
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm, I'm trying to soak in as
much of this stuff as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, to me, like it's hard to get
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a perfect example of,
of, of why, like I love absorbing the
[SPEAKER_01]: content and you guys probably love
absorbing the content for years with the
[SPEAKER_01]: story of sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept hearing about this guy Staten
Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would we ever know who he is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would we ever hear from them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool how things kind of connect
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the funny thing is, is I,
I didn't know anyone wanted to hear from
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were talking about, and then I was
given this nickname Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, you could tell I'm a
little salty about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, the way it was told to me
was, and I won't mention his name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the guy, a guy on another podcast was
like, yeah, I heard you're really private
[SPEAKER_00]: and that, you know, and I, and I said,
who told you that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've never been accused of being
private before I've been out in the open.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, since the ladies, you know,
and I've been talking to people about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea that Gabby would be
private.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, once I found out that
people were interested in hearing from me
[SPEAKER_00]: and I started telling the stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now I can't shut up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it's, that's why we have a,
I feel like we have such a great following
[SPEAKER_02]: already is because the stories seem to be
authentic without it being too much of
[SPEAKER_02]: self-promotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, cause I do sometimes find that like
some of the other shows that I've listened
[SPEAKER_02]: to personally, when it does come to like
people with the self-promotion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can really tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I feel like we have this little bit
of an authenticness coming about the way
[SPEAKER_02]: that we tell our stories because it is
more towards like letting individuals tell
[SPEAKER_02]: their story, how they came to the plant or
how the plant came to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and kind of just like the organic
nature of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually I do want to ask you a
question because this is the way we grow
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a segment of the craft growers
network.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to know how you grow,
but firstly, I really want to know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you grew first and who taught you how to
grow plants in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't even necessarily need to be
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, for instance, my grandma
taught me how to grow a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my dad also reinforced that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just more like a small tomato
or like tomato garden or cucumbers or just
[SPEAKER_02]: other little produce things.
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandma actually had a sorrel from
France that she brought over and it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have the same cutting of it from
the same root stock that I've kept going
[SPEAKER_02]: now for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's like one of the things that
I tie to my growing story, but I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear yours as it pertains to, you know,
where you, where you Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wish I had a better story and I
wish I had a mentor, but growing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I was a city kid, you know,
I grew up in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not appreciate nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no interest in growing or anything
of that in my teen years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I was in the Pacific Northwest in
the knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know what brick weed looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being pretty spoiled there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you know what some shitty
beasters look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, some, some really crappy beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were raised on beasters here,
but apparently whenever I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: beasters, people sometimes, especially the
East coast, they're like, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't no Mexican, but I didn't start
my first pot plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know anything about photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know anything about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like a throw it in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came up, got maybe three sets of lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, what do you do with
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I killed it between that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then actually growing again,
I had a cactus for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I managed to kill that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, Ooh, not a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, eventually when things
were a little bit more lax in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state and I did actually get my medical
card, I was able to go into the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could pick up seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could pick up clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I got started with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately for me, I didn't have a
mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's all kind of self-taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, there were forums back in the day,
but that information was like 50,
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 on whether it was good or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that around?
[SPEAKER_01]: What year was this like 2010, 2011?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there were, you know, there were a few
books, uh, Danny Danko.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the show called free weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was back on the old high times
podcast network.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I got a lot of information
to start and some books, but I just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of progressed from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started, you know, with your basic soil
grow your Fox farm and your three part as
[SPEAKER_01]: you see other people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just, it's, it's progressed
through a bunch of different styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they say cannabis is a
gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gateway drug to gardening because
now I have huge beds outside where I grow
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow all kinds of things, things that
flower or things that finish faster than
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis sometimes, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today I'm doing more of an organic
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going, you know, full hippie,
as I like to say with worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beneficial insects and adding in my
own poop to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like working with a kind of almost a
super soil, a soil with enough nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: in it already, but from organic sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just do a few top dressings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause again, I wanted to get people
started and I know that if I can take
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and that kind of aspect out of
someone's first grow, they may be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay more attention to the plant and they
may have more success versus someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to measure things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the road I've been going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down for years is trying to find a simple
soil for people to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of top dressings do you like to
use?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, uh, yeah, like talk us through
like the, the 15 minute elevator pitch
[SPEAKER_02]: flower cycle for a organic gardener
indoors with top dressings.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the top dressing is just a combination
of, I could grab the bag, but it's a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a kiss organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do I have it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stand up bone meal, alfalfa potassium,
sulfate, insect, frass, gypsum,
[SPEAKER_01]: molastinite, soy protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got my, my little notes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so for like flowering,
what pot size is going to be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: determining factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the length of your vegetative period
is going to be a big factor when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, like water only soils or
super soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger the pot means the bigger the
battery, the longer it will last before
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to feed it five gallons,
seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going a 45 day veg, um,
sometimes I'll check things out,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a real quick veg and I'll go,
uh, a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically because with organic
ingredients, you have to think really two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks ahead because it's not
immediately plant available, like a
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic nutrient would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times what I'll do is a few
weeks before the flip, I'll put on a veg
[SPEAKER_01]: top dressing, which doesn't really start
to become effective until that transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already switched it to 1212,
but the plant and the hormones are just
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find, you know, a little extra nitrogen
boost through that period, feeding it as
[SPEAKER_01]: if it were a veg plant is still
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of kick starts it off into
the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at about two weeks after flip,
you're still a little bit in the stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come back and I'll do another top
dressing with a, with the bloom formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a veg and a bloom formula
for the dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll typically let it ride
because what I'm working with these days
[SPEAKER_01]: is I'm really focusing on kind of like 60
days or under plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it were to go 70 days, I may top dress
again at week five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just again, it takes a few weeks to become
available, but that is typically how I
[SPEAKER_01]: approach flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some organic bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need a foliar spray or something,
that's a little bit more immediate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, it's, it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hands off, which is good for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like the, uh, the way that
I've seen a lot of people growing with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, with organic amendments, especially
with top dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you happen to like reuse your,
your substrate afterwards?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you remediating it in any way and
replanting in it after you let the root
[SPEAKER_02]: stock rot out or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start using, reusing my soil
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically what I have done is I have
brought it outdoors to that big bed that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody should have that much perlite
in their garden, but I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, you know, actually,
I think, I think it was Wolf, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that told me if you use black food
coloring and you run it through the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: it may die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that perlite a different color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't put it into practice yet,
but logically I'm like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I am going to start reusing it
and amending it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working again with Tad Hussey from
Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on my own custom soil blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that works specifically,
well, kind of universally, but
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically with my genetics,
again, to where somebody could like pick
[SPEAKER_01]: up the genetics, pick up the soil,
follow my SOPs that I've shown them on the
[SPEAKER_01]: video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they should be able to get a similar
result, but that does include.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say pick up genetics,
are you talking about from seed stock or a
[SPEAKER_02]: clone stock or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I right now am just seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done any clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there, there's some different reasons
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you're kind of giving it all away
when you give out your special clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't the Westport grape juice is,
is like my special thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do have that backed up with one
person is gross space killer, a John.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out on the East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's wins awards and he has won a few
awards recently with that and his eight
[SPEAKER_01]: one eight head Banny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He blends the two rosins to make Hachimaki
grape juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took second at David dude in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took third at the Pelle Polari,
uh, turpworts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, but yeah, clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of keep those close to the chest
right now, but the seeds people can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I meant by, you know,
pick up genetics, pick up genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up the soil, follow the procedures
and you should get the same results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you describe the Westport grape
juice, the breeder cut for people just
[SPEAKER_02]: cause you know, I've seen it on Instagram
a few times, but I've never actually heard
[SPEAKER_02]: the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the Westport grape juice,
as far as effects, people like to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm something that I typically go for in
the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more relaxing and
sedative without knocking your like
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligence level down a few pegs kind of
just lets the muscles just kind of relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, you know, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to have like, you know how
sometimes you get into those deep
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations and then it's like 45
minutes later and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, we went deep on that one,
but it feels like two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I get with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as like, I know I personally enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The profile though, like tastes and the
aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the aroma, while it's growing,
you'll get almost kind of like a carnival
[SPEAKER_01]: candy grape to it, but as it ripens and as
it dries and cures, it matures into more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a like wine grape, almost like kind of
like a red, like with body, something with
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of a better word.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, like almost more like a,
like a Cabernet grape or something where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's a little more acidic,
almost citrusy with the grape in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like a conquered grape would be
like a pie grape smell.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: More towards the Cabernet, but I don't
really get citrus or acidity from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is cream to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has kind of a nice, on the inhale,
on the inhale, you get that, that mature
[SPEAKER_01]: wine grape with some creaminess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of smooth that it rolls off
the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you exhale, there's that
like little patch in the back of your
[SPEAKER_01]: throat that always gets dry and you're
like that little patch, just a hint of gas
[SPEAKER_01]: touches that patch on the way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't, you don't get it from the
upfront profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get it from the, you know,
initial hit, but yeah, when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: exhaling it, just that little bit of gas
tingles you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of made it stick out and
was special for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the way that it grows,
it's commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it stays short.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays squat, which for me is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for, you know, the people that I'm
aiming towards home breeders and tents,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it short, keep it tight, keep it
squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't stretch a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say one time stretch if that,
and then just, it just chunks up with like
[SPEAKER_01]: nice, thick golf ball buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's from a commercial aspect,
commercially viable, but from an enjoyment
[SPEAKER_01]: side, yeah, but the profile and the
effects are just something unique to me
[SPEAKER_01]: and other people are enjoying it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that, it sounds really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally love purple and grape
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just growing up in the Bay area,
I had access to a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's nostalgic for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've been running at the commercial
facility that I've been managing what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: called beach grapes from Oni seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number 12 cut that we hunted and
it's a very much conquered grapes with
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of like creamy, but also like a
lot of fuel gassiness on both the front
[SPEAKER_02]: and back end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so things like that just always kind
of, they're really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they hit the palette for me really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you transitioned from cannabis to
vegetables, not the other way around,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I always find fascinating because it
was the opposite for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so when you first started growing
cannabis, what was, what was your first
[SPEAKER_02]: successful grow like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had beginner's luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my first two or three grows were,
were really beginner's luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they went very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do much feeding of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, Fox farm that that soil has a
little bit of a charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will get you through a little bit a
month or so of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started with the premise of like,
I just want to see what the plant does
[SPEAKER_01]: again, not having that mentor,
not having that background of gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, okay, I need to see what
the plant is going to do naturally before
[SPEAKER_01]: I start adding all these other things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know when I start adding these other
things in, it did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I got started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started with again, bag seed,
which most people will start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I mentioned the,
the Washington medical system,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010, 2011, uh, is when it really kicked
off in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to get access to,
you know, professional seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always hit my first professional cut
was a Jax cleaner too, uh, from TGA
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm cool still to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I judge every lemon strain
off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hunt the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Jax cleaner too.
[SPEAKER_01]: From they hunted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put out a killer clone like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it was so, and it was like a lemon
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like a lemon candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there was a lemon head taste to it,
but it was so astringent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ate the rubber ring around the top of
my ball jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's how astringent that Jax
cleaner too was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my first pro cut, as I like to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I have never had a great
lemon strain, like the closest thing that
I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could ever think of was like a really
good Jack Herrera or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that was more on the floral end with
the citrus to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, I've always been like envious of
either like the Jax cleaner or the lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: tree or the lemon up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I've, I've heard great things about
lemon up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know like, cause I got really
tired of orange flavored stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seemed that it eventually went
from being like this nice citrusy orange
[SPEAKER_02]: to almost this like dirty orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the rinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like kind of almost week old, week old
orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did follow up that Jax cleaner too,
with the agent orange from TJ at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one reminded me of almost like
the scratch and sniff sticker type of
[SPEAKER_01]: orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, like Calia,
but then it went to like, kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying it morphed a little bit into
like Tangy and Mimosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those two, like I pretty much,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally enjoy them, but they're,
they're like black licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody is like, yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either like it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes to like Tangy and those
people are like, yeah, I ate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, with your, the Westport grape
juice, what, or, or actually any of your
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, like, cause I kind of want to
know more about your breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, uh, what's your breeding style?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you like to do line breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like to do back crosses or are you
making feminized or regular seeds and sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of like, what generation have you taken
certain things to and, and made these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it sounds very stable what you're
dealing with to be able to provide a soil
[SPEAKER_02]: specific recipe and even an environment
and irrigation strategy and feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I find that to be super impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to know a little bit more about
your, your breeding style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of a little bit all of the
above and things happen slowly for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just at the scale that I may be able
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of really good testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I can run 500 of something to get
a good idea of what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't do it personally in house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feminized though, a lot of new growers
like the feminized and with the Westport
[SPEAKER_01]: grape juice, people have seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People heard people talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, all right, I'll do,
you know, I'll do an S one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll feminize it, make a first generation
of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping to get something that was
going to be like a spitting image of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of shocked me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were basically five distinct phenos
that came from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas I really thought I would get one,
maybe like one and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got five distinct phenos from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's I've got a video up there,
which shows the grow of all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows all of the phenos start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a lot of also good feedback
out there for people resting thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: popped up with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll talk about back-crossing and
line breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that gas, that little bit of
gas on the exhale a second ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I easily know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: After doing the self thing, like three out
of 10 are going to be all gas,
[SPEAKER_01]: single note, nothing, but, and the easy
way to spot those very easily is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your lease will typically grow
like this to tuck leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it wants to grow like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the leaves on those gas ones will
grow like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of an interesting
surprise because I hadn't done any self
[SPEAKER_01]: thing before on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: With like line breeding or back-crossing
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm, I'm doing a little bit of
probably more back-crossing than line
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, although I do want to do line
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that because I'm working with
the Westport grape juice and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: working with other plants that I like and
that I'm very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll put them together and I'm,
I'm going through and seeing what is
[SPEAKER_01]: really dominant and what is seemingly
recessive about that plant compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: some other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do have regular crosses as well
as the feminized with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am at one point going to be bringing
it back to the Westport grape juice to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if I can lock that in more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I would love to get that in like a
solid stable seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the goal I'm working to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it is feminized line breeding
isn't as easy, but back-crossing because I
[SPEAKER_01]: have out-crossed it to other males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regular seeds that makes my life a
little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just takes time though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I've done a little bit of breeding
myself and I think the furthest I took
[SPEAKER_02]: something to was an F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that it was like stabilized
between like two different specific,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, structural phenotypes, but then the
actual chemo type and the terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: were vastly different and the effects were
also vastly different amongst the
[SPEAKER_02]: structural similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was, and then I had to move and I
lost a lot of the space that I had for
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, Oh, well, this is going to
go on the back burner for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do like the idea of back-crossing
just because locking in those,
[SPEAKER_02]: those traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does create some bottleneck events
in certain cases, but it does also kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: remove a lot of the recessive traits or
bring the recessive traits forward that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can definitely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to know like, so where,
where did you get the idea of creating
[SPEAKER_02]: this recipe specific soil for,
for your specific strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it something that you're working on
for just one strain or are you trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: create it for multiple strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for multiple strains and it's,
you know, it should be more of just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: general feed, even though it's
specifically going to work with what I
[SPEAKER_01]: have, nothing as far as my genetics right
now are outliers as far as like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it, you know, it needs extra
phosphorus or like, Oh, you have to like
[SPEAKER_01]: cut this at a certain page.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all basically general feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing outside of the norm,
which is good because that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: catch the majority of other strains out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will always be the outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I come across that, we'll be able
to, you know, easily tweak the recipe to
[SPEAKER_01]: do something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I want to kind of set people up
for success and real quick, I'm back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one way that I kind of try to make my
life easier or set myself up for success
[SPEAKER_01]: is I cross it with a lot of older stuff,
a lot of Amsterdam genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I travel there every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things over there are not exactly
sexy, but they're very stable and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not sexual expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just means as like you plant 10,
you're going to get like 9.5 looking the
[SPEAKER_01]: same out of 10 for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I grow that and I'm familiar with
that and I've grown what it gets crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: to, and I'm very familiar with that,
it makes my job a lot easier looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the offspring versus if I had hot,
hot and hot, hot, where I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, sweet 20 expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and, and working with a stock of
plants that are from hopefully a far
[SPEAKER_02]: enough removed genetic population will
also help create some stabilities in the
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, yeah, that's a wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a wonderful idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your growing time, one, one segment
I'd like to add into this show that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to try and sneak in here at this
point is what are some issues you've had
[SPEAKER_02]: with growing that you had like the most
learning curve adaptation from,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what helped you the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: In your growing journey as it pertained to
an incident that you faced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it sounds kind of funny,
but like watering properly makes a big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's growing throughout my years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come to realize like you can grow and
it will turn out good, but when you really
[SPEAKER_01]: nail everything, like from your watering,
from your lighting to your airflow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do see a really big difference in
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the watering was one that I think it
was, that was my limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while solutions like auto pots or
self watering stuff, or you could get like
[SPEAKER_01]: a Blumont tensiometer, a water meter,
and you, you use it as a tool to train
[SPEAKER_01]: your hands or to train your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all know when a plant's thirsty
or it's overwatered, but there's still
[SPEAKER_01]: that like fine line where it still looks
good, but it's thirsty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to tie into that as well, probably the
biggest thing that I underestimated was
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD vapor pressure deficit combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of your temperature and your humidity,
the math between those is what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: drives, you know, transpiration,
plant sweat uptake from the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a way to really drive and steer
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, without, I didn't know about VPD
for over a decade and I grew just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I learned about it, once I really
started to control those parameters,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to see differences and I was
like, wow, I was missing out all those
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow without knowing it,
but when you know it, it makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to just emphasize that point for
all the listeners about VPD because I've
[SPEAKER_02]: heard in a lot of other podcasts and
other, other spaces that people will say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, VPD is over exaggerated and how
important it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll say, you should just focus on
making sure your heat doesn't get out of
[SPEAKER_02]: control or that your temp or that your
humidity doesn't get out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel as though the funny thing in
saying that is somewhat contradictory
[SPEAKER_02]: because by taking both of those into
account, you are paying attention to VPD
[SPEAKER_02]: just without doing the calculations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel as though another huge aspect
to the vapor pressure deficit is also the
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction with the radiation input to
the plant from your lighting source.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do agree that the vapor pressure
deficit is kind of a determining factor of
[SPEAKER_02]: the transpiration rate, but the driving
factor for the transpiration rate is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the photosynthetic potential within
the plant due to the lighting at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by, you know, by increasing the
lighting, you're going to increase the
[SPEAKER_02]: need to transpire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your limiting factor then is the VPD
within your environment of how fast the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant can transpire and have the active
transport of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, what led you to seeing that
as such a important factor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what did you notice in your plants
that made that sort of the discovery that
[SPEAKER_02]: made such a huge difference for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of in the morphology and the color of
the plants, the way that it was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle nutrients, the way that it accepted
the nutrients and utilize them more
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it almost seemed like the
leaves, like the fingers became wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were happier to, you know,
just like stretch out and be, I'm a happy
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's, it's, it's one of those
things that you can grow without paying
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of us did for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why some people, you know,
who poo it as not being uber important
[SPEAKER_01]: because well, you can grow without paying
attention, but when you do pay attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, you can notice differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually, you know, cause I have
commercial experience as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone to school for some of these
things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of, a lot of the tips, you know,
as, as a home grower or someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: coaches home growers, I always say size
matters and CO2 is, is kind of an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use for this for a home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like your last 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're 97% dialed and you have
everything working and it's just rocking
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're bored with life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toss something new in there, but there's
so many things as far as like temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity of your light that need to be in
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it's not even going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have those basic things
down first, then it's all for not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the things that we hear,
you know, again, size matters is for
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if I have four plants in a four by
four and I get two extra grams off of each
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, big whoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we go back to my commercial
facility where you have over 60,000 plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're getting two extra grams,
that's a big fricking difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things out there that
are meant for, you know, just fine tuning
[SPEAKER_01]: it or commercial that it applies to your
home grow as well, but it may not be as
[SPEAKER_01]: important, but VPD is as important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within that last 3% or however many
percent people are operating up to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whatever they have that capacity
of production for, I feel as though
[SPEAKER_02]: there's also even stages in which to
implement those last 3% items because
[SPEAKER_02]: like, let's say you, that CO2 is one of
those last 3% items.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to implement under canopy
lighting before you implement CO2.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you don't want to implement like a
higher EC feed if you're using hydroponics
[SPEAKER_02]: or a more intensive feeding schedule for
top dressing or like worm casting teas or
[SPEAKER_02]: sprouted seed teas or other things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you aren't getting enough lighting,
to the plant or giving it enough CO2 for
[SPEAKER_02]: the high transpiration rate that you're
looking to get all those nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: transported.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a lot of people do think that
implementing something, cause like you
[SPEAKER_02]: said, bigger is better and it's,
I feel as though there's, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: positive way to spend that in the industry
for home growers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in some cases people over go on
things and, and they, um, they'll,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll over implement before they have
the ability to sustain those
[SPEAKER_02]: implementations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that's a really great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned bigger is better too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another like keyword or like
red flag that I always give to like home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers when, cause companies always want
to talk about bigger is better and Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, you know, X amount more yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say, what are you growing for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it biomass or is it cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are different things you can
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things will get you more biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're commercial or you know,
whatever cool biomass is what you're after
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain things you can do to
increase the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of drought stress at the end
to try to increase cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a personal consumer, medicinal
patient, home grower, I'm more interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabinoids and biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree wholeheartedly with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, and then there's also a
way to have a best of both worlds
[SPEAKER_02]: scenario, but that's also part of the last
3%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, like you want to push for
quality and then you can push for yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at one point you are going to see
diminishing return on your quality if your
[SPEAKER_02]: yields are over pushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that is an issue a lot in
the commercial space, but even for home
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, a lot of people are thinking,
how can I get the most out of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should just be thinking,
how can I get what I can do the best out
[SPEAKER_02]: of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from growing a plant
multiple times, which I don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of new growers or home growers
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to become familiar with your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people used to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, they had whole rooms of
monocrot, one thing, and they knew how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to take your failures in
stride.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you got to take your failures
in stride too, because if you just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen too many people go up,
I've killed this plant, I'm never doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I want to say,
no, look at what happened and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, I can not do that next time,
or I can figure out what happened and do
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do see that in the community as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mistakes make us better if we pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a failure if you don't learn
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a big fan of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause again, it's not a fast growing
plant, which is why shows like this are so
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can crowdsource the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can squeeze a full year into,
you know, three months or a few months of
[SPEAKER_01]: just learning and paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sharing the information is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I kind of want to take us back to
your cannabis journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were home growing for however long
and kind of tell us what transitioned your
[SPEAKER_02]: home growing into the commercial space and
what that looked like for you and whether
[SPEAKER_02]: you're still participating in it or why
you exited that, that space or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or what you're, you're looking at there,
perhaps even for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, currently I'm looking, I'm in
Washington state, but I'm looking for a
[SPEAKER_01]: license in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there's some on the secondary
market, but nothing that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, Washington has pushed out the
medical people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pushed out the mom and pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the licenses are capped.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't issued new licenses in years
and they aren't going to issue them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't, now that the medical system is
gone in Washington, I can't play,
[SPEAKER_01]: which sucks looking at Oregon to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my transition kind of started was I
have a background as an audio engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked in that for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2016, the company that I worked for
was sold and it sold to a company out of
[SPEAKER_01]: China that basically bought the name and
bought the reputation of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just going to do things their
own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the owners were very fricking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the most amazing job or time in
my life ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, they set it up with the
new owners because the majority of us at
[SPEAKER_01]: that job were so specialized in what we
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no jobs in this country to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they set it up to where anybody who
wanted to, you could go back and the new
[SPEAKER_01]: company pays for two years of schooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, I had already been
involved with music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been making music, but I went to
school to understand why when I turn this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it sounds good because I know when I turn
this, it's going to sound good,
[SPEAKER_01]: but why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in 2016, I had already been growing
cannabis and I was getting pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: results, but short of having that mentor,
mentor, I didn't really understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Behind a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as my audio teacher taught me,
that's always stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you have to know the rules
before you can break the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you understand how something
works, you're able to manipulate it to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the results you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 2016, I went back to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to sustainable agriculture and
small farm systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a two year program up here in
Washington in the Skagit Valley,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is actually a pretty powerhouse as
far as the nation's fruits and vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're big on blueberries here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Cosmic Crisp Apple with Washington
State University, I was part of the field
[SPEAKER_01]: trials for that during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I kind of forgot the
original question, but that's how I got
[SPEAKER_01]: into the commercial aspect or the deeper
aspect of doing what I do is that 2016
[SPEAKER_01]: career change and schooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you went to school and you
gained this knowledge of the sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture, where did you go?
[SPEAKER_02]: And put those practices into use for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't say the name of the company
just because there are NDAs and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't say that because I typically
trash their practices and how they ran
[SPEAKER_01]: their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I can talk about one,
but not the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about your experience so
that people know kind of how different
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of the industry work and whatever
you're comfortable with talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I won't be too elusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2017, 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the largest indoor grow in the
state of Washington, and they're still one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the larger companies out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to change their name every
couple of years because what they did is
[SPEAKER_01]: the funding was from a Russian fishing
oligarchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could probably connect the dots
there, but they had a lot of money to
[SPEAKER_01]: invest and they would build these awesome
facilities and then they got bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they would do is they would build
a new facility and then bring the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plants from the old facility to the new
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that facility had about two years
before it was burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it is when you take people who have
been growing in a house and then all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden give them a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got brought in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped them bring in their first
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually turned out good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there from when they went from in
the red into the black, but just the SOPs
[SPEAKER_01]: there were lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The safety protocol was extremely lacking,
which is why ultimately I left.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just also, you can't give 60,000
plants the same love I can give six.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that you have to
do commercially to protect your investment
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would never do at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But commercially, you kind of have to do
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many people have
smoked my arm hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have smoked my arm hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked my own arm hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you're just defoliating in these big
beds, you come home and you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually we did get sleeves and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were starting up, there were a
lot of things that were learned as you
[SPEAKER_01]: went along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of fun to be there for
that process too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because A, I got to play with other
people's plants and B, make mistakes on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this turned out good sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would tell me to do some ludicrous
stripping and I'm like, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do it and I'd come back three days
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would never tell I went in there and
did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to learn a lot of cool
things that way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this company, were you initially
brought or attracted to this company due
[SPEAKER_02]: to the growing style?
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering you went to school for
sustainable agriculture, I assume that you
[SPEAKER_02]: would look then for a company that applied
or implemented either living soil methods
[SPEAKER_02]: or some sort of organic or sustainable
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wish I had the option to
choose from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few good companies around here
that do it that way, but they're typically
[SPEAKER_01]: small, like three, four people maximum run
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll hire people for like the
harvest and for trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: This again, be the largest facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a full-time job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was grow, but I, I, I learned quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The less you know, the better they like
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, gung ho as I was with the
knowledge that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: The passion I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, you know, you can make
this change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Hey, I spotted this little
bit of, you know, like sticky residue on
[SPEAKER_01]: one of your lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably something to look at,
but they weren't necessarily interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work your way up from the bottom and the
higher you get, the more they'll listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of went in as the grunt and
they promoted me pretty quickly to
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, but no, it was never
something where I was really able to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement.
[SPEAKER_01]: My vision or a lot of the knowledge that I
had learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it taught me new knowledge and
new SOPs of way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I wish I could find that,
that perfect marriage out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was really just like, okay,
now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had worked at this audio company for
like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just gone to school for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go get a normal fricking
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to drive an hour away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause where I'm at, there's a moratorium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to drive an hour every day just
to get to this job, but it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was only late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made the most of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've definitely been there before I moved
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was driving to the same place I work at
and it was like 50 minutes every day there
[SPEAKER_02]: and 50 minutes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does become the drive becomes
tedious, but podcasts help good audio
[SPEAKER_02]: books help.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, but I feel that it commuting is
sometimes one of the worst parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you happen to move on to any other
commercial spaces after this one,
[SPEAKER_02]: or was that kind of where you,
you left it after your experience there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I kind of left it there because I
realized, and again, knowing some people
[SPEAKER_01]: with other grows in the area, I realized
it's never going to be the way that I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never going to be the way that I
fully believe it should be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, there's some good reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some crap reasons for that,
but it's never going to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the way that I want to do it or the
way that I think it should be done with,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I'm patient first, like again,
coming from the medicinal days,
[SPEAKER_01]: patient first, like you're not,
Oh, well, what can I put on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so we could get it to harvest or
like, eh, we'll, we'll cut off this top
[SPEAKER_01]: Cola, which we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cut off, hand cut the top Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hand trim that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we sent that for testing after
rolling it in Keith.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's things that are just standard
practice that I don't agree with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to play that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I transitioned from that grow through the
connections I made into working at a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked security there and basically was
like the chief information officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could tell you anything about
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for me more fulfilling
because I got to help people who were new
[SPEAKER_01]: to it and people who older people,
there's some cool stories, but that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: never touched cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that was a little bit more
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, like COVID hit,
we were an essential industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything was closed, but us,
and it just became a shit show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'm just going to do my
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's, I'm glad we kind of like
brought this story up to where we are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do want to know though, because you
are kind of within the space as an
[SPEAKER_02]: educator and as someone who I would assume
keeps their finger on the pulse of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and how it both affects home
growers and other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you see the cultivation industry
going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it be from a home growers,
from a home growers perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: from a consumer's perspective,
or even in the commercial space,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm sure that you still have
connections there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just through the interactions that you
have within the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you feel as though it's going to
be going over the next five to 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my big picture, optimistic,
rosy clouds vision would be that it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes federally legal, which is going to
open the doors to the big players,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like the Anheuser-Busch's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to push out a lot of the middle
tier people that currently exist and
[SPEAKER_01]: dominate the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to cry for them because they
put me out, they pushed the mom and pops
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, taste your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what that's going to do, hopefully the
federal legalization, it will create those
[SPEAKER_01]: big players.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will create the Anheuser-Busch's,
but that's when craft will succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ultimately for small people like
me, for those, you know, 10 lighters,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 lighters, that's what we need to see
because we're never going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete on price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it on scale, particularly if we
allow imports from other countries,
[SPEAKER_01]: the price is just going to, it's quality
and the uniqueness that are always going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully that's where I see it
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, you know, pie in the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that doesn't happen, I think there's
just going to be more consolidation in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be less interest
commercially, less interest in finding the
[SPEAKER_01]: new thing versus something that works
under these particular SOPs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically an economic plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you flip that back to the home
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep searching for those
unicorns.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep finding those
different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I think the
legalization as we know it now has been a
[SPEAKER_01]: big catalyst for is to find all these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you went from, you know,
let's just make up a number here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went from like a thousand people
popping seeds to all of a sudden now you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a hundred thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get through so many more things
and pick out so many different varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that's what we see from the
kind of the home or the craft market is
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll continue to innovate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue to push the boundaries of
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is going to get you stoned at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much everything is going to get you
stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about the experience to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably where I really see it
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't go pie in the sky,
but it's going to be more experience
[SPEAKER_01]: related.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree wholeheartedly with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I've always thought it kind
of mimicked or mirrored the the transition
[SPEAKER_02]: from alcohol prohibition to the beer
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do feel as though the timeline might
be truncated on that a little bit where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to see kind of whether,
if it, if it ever does go federally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put a caveat on ever because it's,
I feel like we've always seen it to be
[SPEAKER_02]: right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that corner keeps getting further
and further away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if it ever does go legal,
then I do feel as though there is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a huge takeover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely of corporate and private
interests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll see a lot of home growers
or small craft growers who are still
[SPEAKER_02]: adding the support to their local
community and local consumers to succeed
[SPEAKER_02]: while some of the mid ranged ones or,
or where the production of quality is not
[SPEAKER_02]: as heavily regarded, or if it just isn't
there will be kind of gobbled up by the
[SPEAKER_02]: larger corporations to allow for more
space for their probably not terrible,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably unfortunately it'll probably be
smokable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it'll probably be something
where if you're in a pinch in a state
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're like, I don't have anything
with me, but Hey, it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can just go to the gas station and
pick up a pack of whatever's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I feel like that it won't be
terrible because there will be some
[SPEAKER_02]: standards in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, but I do, I do see how like,
you're going to have your, just like you
[SPEAKER_02]: have your cores drinkers, you're going to
have your people that are looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The local city is producing for them as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm from the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're, this is where microbreweries
came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when it comes to microbreweries,
it really started here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had the example of that laid out
for me for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I paid very close
attention to because I think it will mimic
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but we still have to have that
hurdle fall before we can have that farm
[SPEAKER_01]: to table experience where you can go into
the brewery or you could go into my grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get a little tray with eight different
strains on it and you can try them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'd love to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly for the smaller people as
something we tried to get into Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: market for tier one, which is the smallest
tier direct to consumer farm to table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's really the only way the
little guy can compete out here that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't do it, but that's still a
hope and a dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of was, I saw that and I was hoping
that that would pass as well, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of had hope that there would be a
push in some areas to go back to medical
[SPEAKER_02]: with state's rights being such a big issue
as of, as of late and allowing for people
[SPEAKER_02]: to make those decisions within that state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of like, cause the organ
medical market was really great as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an organ and it was a great market at
one point, but where they kept the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: as just the ability for those patients to
receive a discount at a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that no single producer could then
still claim medical on their production of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant or that there would be any
standards to back that up kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Defeated the purpose and in my eyes,
but I'd always hope that something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that would come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do agree with you that is a little
bit of a pie in the sky hope at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've come a long way from just 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 more years, who knows, keeping the
fingers crossed and staying optimistic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll be growing either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did absolutely add a five to 10 year
caveat to the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're completely fair in that
assessment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just invited me to leave perhaps the
last part of this show here open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything more within the
cannabis space that you wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing related or otherwise?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is, this has been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a fun conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the theme that hopefully
people take away, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I will just reiterate is just
continue to share your knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to share the experience because
we're going to get so much further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Faster if we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we build substance behind what
we're doing, not just a flash in the pan,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just a cool of mylar, not just,
you know, the next hit song, you build
[SPEAKER_01]: substance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get a lot farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 2012, I started out my first like
foray into public education in years,
[SPEAKER_01]: MMJ network, seniors, medical marijuana
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the people who have the biggest
reefer madness stigma associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis in my mind, those are the
people who could probably benefit the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest from cannabis, whether it be
aches and pains, just the daily things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the education there is so important
because they think you're going to hell
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither of which are true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through that education, through that
sharing, through providing substance,
[SPEAKER_01]: real world, practical applications for
these things, we're going to get a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things we need to
continue to push.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it makes me a little sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I said earlier, I'm like,
horrible at self-promotion because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not what it's really about for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some people who would much
rather talk about, you know, the new mylar
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, what event they're going to
and how many grams of this they had than
[SPEAKER_01]: actually building that substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them probably will be,
but yeah, keep, keep building that
[SPEAKER_01]: substance folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would add to the
conversation, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, in my opinion, I feel as
though anything that helps end a
[SPEAKER_02]: stigmatization to cannabis is a positive
media in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when people do get really into the
whole mylar thing or who's promoting who
[SPEAKER_02]: and on what platform and all that,
you know, it does become a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: monotonous at times, but also it doesn't
hurt the industry as much as it helps it
[SPEAKER_02]: in my eyes, just to help bring more
awareness to the fact that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to normalize this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do agree though, I prefer to have
more meaningful conversations about it
[SPEAKER_02]: with people that are in this for the long
haul and about it for the medicine and the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and the community and the way that
the plant and the people interact and how
[SPEAKER_02]: they help us interact with each other,
even in a greater way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do wholeheartedly agree with you on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you make an excellent point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant brings so many diverse people
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is blessed and changed my life just in
that one fact alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do actually have a couple of
little like wrap up questions that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a little bit of a quick fire
because, you know, some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis shows have those at the end and I
just feel as though it's worth it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: community to tie those things together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ubiquitous, what is your favorite strain
of all time if you had to choose one?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have to choose a couple,
try and put them in order.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with the one that goes to the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most, most of the time is the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91, just a fantastic strain,
something that has been around for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, something that is often imitated,
never duplicated, but I found a producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there is one commercial cannabis
that I will go out and buy and it's this
[SPEAKER_01]: one company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it pre 91 Chem, which is a
little suspect to me, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 Chem is where I'm at as far as my
desert island strain goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay with sharing the name of that
company?
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume it's a legal Washington
recreational producer just for people to
[SPEAKER_02]: know where they can find Chad Westport's
go-to commercial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so it was L of A, E, V, E,
L, and then they changed the name of the
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a jar in the other room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just look for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says pre 91 Chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only time I've ever seen pre 91
Chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red and black graphics on the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 35 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it called Plaid?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who you're talking about,
but no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plaid had the Melvins, which was something
that interested me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I did score.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I did sketch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blanking it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't buy it often.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we post this, I'll try and post like
a short of this or something and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: have to comment on it with the correct
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the favorite strain, who's your
favorite breeder of all time other than
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a dang good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like James Loud is a person who I would
probably consider like the mentor of today
[SPEAKER_01]: just because I've been watching his shows
and following him and actually having a
[SPEAKER_01]: rapport with them for about four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've probably learned the most directly
from him as when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also got a really awesome book out
right now, but I also want to toss Mean
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene from Mendocino, Freeborn Selections
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy is an amazing storyteller.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an amazing librarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, and I've talked to him many times,
I could listen to him for four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, talk about strain history,
his processes, because you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like going to school helped me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say, you know, there's a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, education is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other experiences, the best
education and experience is the best in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion, because education, you're going
to miss out on those little nuances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, Mean Gene would have that
you only get through experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be able to read that
in a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you just rely on experience,
sometimes that can turn you into a
[SPEAKER_01]: dinosaur, because you're not catching up
with the current times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, experience, education are the two
best, but Jackson, Mean Gene from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino, Freeborn Selections,
that guy is like a thesaurus or a
[SPEAKER_01]: dictionary encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he definitely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always enjoyed listening to him
whenever he's on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always has a wealth of knowledge and
especially when it comes back to goes back
[SPEAKER_02]: to like the different crosses and the
lineages of different things and how they
[SPEAKER_02]: play into each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always just I'm always impressed
by the any strains that use his strains as
[SPEAKER_02]: the parent lineage, especially with like
Black Lime Reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one, I feel like is in so many
different things nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just popped a precursor to that too from
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from 2021, but it's his Black Lime
number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's before the reserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Black Lime number two times his
Cherry Limeade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been sitting on those,
been sitting on those for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years and I just popped them and they're,
you know, they're seedlings this tall
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited to see what comes of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I hope I get a male that
I'll be able to do some work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a, you know, a Cherry
Limeade to Westport Grape Juice sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: like a juice bomb if I've ever heard of
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystery Slushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a little bit of every flavor in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 7-Eleven Suicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last question of these style of
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two-parter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the first time you ever
consumed cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what is the most memorable
cannabis experience memory, whether it be
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking or seeing a plant or otherwise
that you've had?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time smoking, I don't exactly
remember, but I was a very early teen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty confident it was in the,
the power line trails, the power trails
[SPEAKER_01]: out behind the neighborhood with probably
Tommy and a couple other guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seventh, eighth grade is really when we
kind of got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember actually getting busted with
pot before I had smoked it with my friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend, Greg RIP, he was a,
he was a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had had camel cash and you trade in
the camel cash for the Zippos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a cool camel Zippo and he's
like, Oh, I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you five bucks and some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need five bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had gone into the bathroom at
school to do our little deal and his
[SPEAKER_01]: brother was standing outside and his
brother runs inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, the principal's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he totally like blew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause apparently he was just standing
outside like this, saw the principal ran
[SPEAKER_01]: inside and he knew what was up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I of course had it in my hand at
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the one who got busted with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a couple of weeks later and another
detention, I took it back from his drawer,
[SPEAKER_01]: which he forgot to lock along with some
brass knuckles and a couple other cool
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got my shit back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the first stuff you smoked then
too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was the earlier time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't remember smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember how that hit me,
but yeah, that was one of the earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then probably the most like memorable
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually before you get into the
memorable experience, because you're story
[SPEAKER_02]: spurred my memory and how similar it is to
my first story, I have to just throw it in
[SPEAKER_02]: here really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was in high school, cause I
actually didn't even know about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think until I was in like a sophomore or
junior in high school, which is really odd
[SPEAKER_02]: for growing up in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, I wanted to try cannabis cause I
also, I smoked cigarettes and my one
[SPEAKER_02]: friend was like, well, you want to smoke
something else?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, you know, weed man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, oh, well, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of that, I think, but yeah,
why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's like, all right, I need like
20 bucks and I'm going to go get it from
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy in the high school parking lot at
lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, do you have something to put
it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we got to then keep it on us until
we go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to like the army surplus
store and got one of those weatherproof
[SPEAKER_02]: match containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a metal canister that likes
screws into itself and hinges out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we stuff like, you know, a couple of
nugs in there in the dime bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put it back away in my pocket and I
carried it in my pocket all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I get home at night cause he's
like, all right, we'll meet up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like this evening or,
or the tomorrow evening or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: or before school the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so I get home and as soon as I
get home, my, my mom and my dad are like
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting in the front area of our house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, I've heard from my
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say his name from my friend's dad
that you might've purchased cannabis at
[SPEAKER_02]: school today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, uh, you know, and I don't
know if you've seen the key and peel skit
[SPEAKER_02]: where they start sweating bullets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like that was me at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, what the, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I didn't tell anybody other than the
guy that I got it with, but apparently he
[SPEAKER_02]: told some friends, but I hadn't smoked it
or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in this like actually possibly
the most smellproof container I could have
[SPEAKER_02]: chosen for that small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I don't even know what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked my way out of it somehow,
but I, I count that as being caught
[SPEAKER_02]: because I then, you know, I don't think I
slept all night because I was trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what I was going to do with
this little bit of weed that I thought was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to end my life as I know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go back to school the next day and I
knew my one buddy who had talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: weed before where I think I even heard
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I'll just sell it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just be like, I just need to get some
of what I sold it for back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at least what my friend put into it,
I'll take the loss, but I got to pay my
[SPEAKER_02]: one friend back and be like, listen,
I lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about two weeks later,
we, he found out my friend that had gone
[SPEAKER_02]: in on it with me, found out that his uncle
was like a big time grower and distributor
[SPEAKER_02]: out of Humboldt and got us some really
good blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we smoked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was probably like two,
that's one strain that I do miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got so popular that people stopped
growing it and it's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like it's almost diluted now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's the good blue dream?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the original?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got the Santa Cruz cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got this other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I do remember it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone made it made a lot of
people's careers, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, just with the yields that they could
get without having to put too much effort
[SPEAKER_02]: into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, let's go back to the most
memorable cannabis experience for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you had to think back,
what's the first thing that pops your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you take a second, what,
what is, what is that memorable cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of them that were involved
cannabis as part of the story,
[SPEAKER_01]: but probably the two, the two that popped
to my head that were specific cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the interview that I did and I've
got to interview them four times now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Tommy Chong, like if you rewind to my
teenage self watching up in smoke saying
[SPEAKER_01]: one day you're going to sit down and be
friends, first name basis, talk to him
[SPEAKER_01]: every year with Tommy Chong, wouldn't have
believed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that for me is, is a cool one,
but actual smoking it plant experience
[SPEAKER_01]: itself is, was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I've been going there every year
for quite a few years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I was going back in the nineties
and two thousands when it properly was the
[SPEAKER_01]: hay day, but I wasn't old enough or
traveling at that point, but I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have written for a Sensei seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have almost a hundred published pieces
on their website and their blog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the more memorable experiences
was when I went to the hemp and hash
[SPEAKER_01]: museum in Amsterdam, my buddy,
my boss, Mark took me, gave me kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the private VIP tour, but he took me
downstairs into the secret garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is no longer there, which is why I'm
saying it, but they had a grow down there
[SPEAKER_01]: and we got to just smoke, look at all the
plants that were coming up, plants that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was about to write, you know, descriptions
for just sat there smoking and enjoying
[SPEAKER_01]: our time underneath the museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably one of the more
memorable smoking related experiences with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds quite memorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cause, uh, you know, it made me
even think like watching old, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: like cops, like the show cops where they
would go in to the people's house and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd be, it looked like a normal house
or everything would be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they find the door to the
basement and they go down and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 20 HPS lights, the whole place
is red with everything fully flowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just, that's what I imagine you
would imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walking down into at the time is something
that is just like this fully HPS out
[SPEAKER_02]: basement where it's maybe, you know,
six or seven feet high ceilings or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that kind of cramped,
but filled with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything down there is, is dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I mean the it's below the water
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like water kind of just like
absorbs in the concrete walls and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: always have to deal with that sort of like
moisture and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a few different chambers because
they were growing different strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you pretty much nailed the
description.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this place has heated floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird for the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they just got about 20 HPS underneath
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, welcome back, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually were just wrapping up the last
few questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any questions for Chad before
we, um, we wrap up the rest of the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice that we've opened the lines of
communication though, cause I would love
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, have you guys come and talk
a little bit too, uh, just on my channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of spreading awareness,
trying to introduce people because I like
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been, you know, again,
a really fun interview, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It again, kind of gives me an idea of
where you're coming from and what you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and if you haven't felt it yourself,
we were, we're walking the same road,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So passion for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely did feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I really, uh, I appreciate that
feedback as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is actually the first
episode that we're doing of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way we grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing the way we grow podcast where
I'm hosting it, trying to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more focused on the growing side of things
and people's journey as it pertains to
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, but also kind of mixing in their
own personal story in there, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like it's very important to bring it
as a little bit of a holistic approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I'm sure Gabby also really
appreciated having you here today because
[SPEAKER_02]: we are doing this collaboratively under
the title of a craft growers network,
[SPEAKER_02]: him doing the Gabbing with Gabby show,
me doing the, the way we grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully adding more shows in
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I just wanted to say,
I really appreciate you being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, were there any plugs,
any thank yous you'd want to give out to
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any awareness last minute awarenesses
you'd like to bring up?
