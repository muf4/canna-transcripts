[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today our guest is Jack, or at Jack
Greenstock on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an author, a home grower,
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also the host of the Growing with My
Fellow Growers podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host, Nick Wolfe, or at Mr.
Wolfe Grows on Instagram and Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jack, how have you been lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of a while since we
actually talked in the DMs thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like we've both been pretty busy
in our own world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's new with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's new in your grow world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, next up is Spartan Grown's Project
V.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Vortex F2 project that he made from
Subcool's original Vortex F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took two males and two females and he
kind of quote unquote open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a five pack and those were,
I think, the four that popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got the F2, which he's calling
Project V, and a lot of people have been
[SPEAKER_01]: having a lot of success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually popped a few of them in a batch
of a bunch of different genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with travel and stuff,
ended up having to not go through with
[SPEAKER_01]: that grow, but they were the strongest in
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my next run is going to be purely just
the Project V and that alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, they're regular seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hunt through some males and females,
pick out the best females and grow those
[SPEAKER_01]: out, flower them out and see how they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we actually just had Spartan on a
couple episodes ago, by the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: yours is out, his will have been out for
like two weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about his Project V and all
the effort that he's put into that to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and preserve some of Subcool's genetics
because, well, they're not being made
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having people like him do open
pollinations and stuff is so vital for the
[SPEAKER_00]: community to be able to see some of this
work that's going to eventually go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's awesome to hear that you're
popping some of his Project V.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like from what he was describing
it, that it has like a really like a
[SPEAKER_00]: citrusy side and then a really kind of
nasty funky side to the different terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it sounds like Subcool did a lot
of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango and baby diaper are some of the
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he said, like rotten mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, that sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure so much about the baby
diaper, but if it's strong, like some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stronger stuff out there, chems and
even some of the skunks or OGs,
[SPEAKER_01]: afghans, they might not taste the best,
but they get you a really strong high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're looking for the effect,
sometimes a spoonful of sugar will make
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicine go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a nice tasty dab or something
after or eat something tasty or drink
[SPEAKER_01]: something tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes the medicine, I look at it
first as a medical user.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if somebody doesn't die,
in the case of like the breeding work that
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off with was vegan Doja or Doja
DNA, he every year never kept clones for
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he would take his- That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd get clones from like his buddies,
like he got like a thin mints,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then he crossed it to some stuff that
he popped from seed and had kept over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then each year, cause he was a sun
grown outdoor, it was one season,
[SPEAKER_01]: just one note.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had greenhouses, but he didn't depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would just be one thing per
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always crossed his best stuff together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could look back at like the crosses
and you're like, Oh, this has all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, plus one other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this has all of that,
plus one other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he never would take it to like F2 or
F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, just to have more seeds of
one of his projects, the velvet punch,
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it to F2, ended up finding a bunch
of really cool stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a great be gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some watermelon, subtle phenones
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hunt them out, Tau was actually the
first one who found the watermelon in F2s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but his stuff was always really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hooked me up with some other stuff
called spiked punch that I grew in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told the story, but I got 13 males
and two females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, thank goodness I did sex
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my preferred sex testing person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did sex testing and that run I also
had, funny enough from Subcool,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had two of the spiked punch and one
Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Chernobyl was really, really fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I would have kept the cuts of all
three of those, but life goes on and you
[SPEAKER_01]: either still have seeds or you don't have
those stories.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that being said, there's so many
seeds getting back to like Spartan and
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm popping next.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the project fees, I was thinking
about doing some Brandon Russ gear because
[SPEAKER_01]: his stuff's really fire, but I got it
recently and I've got some stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: from years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just talking about how some of
the best stuff I've ever gotten is from
[SPEAKER_01]: the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually that's because it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like made this year, maybe a few
months ago, maybe six, three, however
[SPEAKER_01]: brand new, you know, as soon as it's dry
and packaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found vigorousness and germination
rates tend to be much higher on fresher,
[SPEAKER_01]: newer seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to at least do one seed run
every year myself, like making more seed
[SPEAKER_01]: of something that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Sour 76 is one that I've had for
a handful of years and it's not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: any younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of my Great White Buffalo
strains, like one that I feel like got
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to be growing those out
and F2ing that to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Sour 76?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually haven't heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an unreleased genetic from Humboldt
Seed Organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a tester and it was a Cali Sour O.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a Cali O Sour Diesel
crossed to Afghan 76.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it Highland Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody got some seed sourced from 1976
in Afghanistan up in the mountain areas
[SPEAKER_01]: because people hear Afghani and they
think, or Afghan, and they think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: one strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a broadleaf in short spot lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like 11, 16, I don't know how many
different regions in Afghanistan that have
[SPEAKER_01]: long histories of cannabis bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a great page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baba is one of them, but there's a few
Afghan selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is probably the best place that
has a breakdown of a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes and things like that for the
different Afghani regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm done with my sentence,
but they're not all just one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the early 2000s, I had early
always heard of people describing that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were like three main varietals of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even hear that much anymore
where people would describe Indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa and Afghanica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it is like, I do feel as
though like Sativa and Indica are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit misleading because like Sativa just
means cultivated, Indica just means of
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, like Afghanica would
just mean of Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to say, you know, that there's only
one Sativa or one Indica, everyone would
[SPEAKER_00]: know that that's, you know, not what
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems almost counterintuitive for
people to think that if somebody says I
[SPEAKER_00]: have an Afghani strain, that it's just one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that I go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The paradigm of Indica, Sativa,
because I understand like Sativa or
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativam.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people haven't seen that Sativam or
S-A-T-I-V-U-M, I might be mispronouncing
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but it's another one of the ways that
it's spelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the Latin way of saying like
you're saying cultivated and Indica is of
[SPEAKER_01]: India and Afghanica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've even seen like people that are
like talking about like America or
[SPEAKER_01]: American like strains or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they've started sub because we have
got such a rich history now at this point
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis breeding in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: that they subdivided it to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just pulled up the Afghan selection
and they have, I'm probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: mispronounce these, but Chimtal is the
Balk region, Baharakh, Badakhistan,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the Hindu Kush, because they have
the Hindu Kush mountain range that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through Afghanistan and a few of those
other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chimtal, which is Hashtate, Daima,
Kash, and Kolm.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all different regions of
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kundos, Kushkak, Mezar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mezar Sharif is pretty famous
historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Panjshir is another Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kwandahar South or maybe Khandahar South
and Rustam Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got Sholgar and Shebergan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry for my brutal mispronunciations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been to Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had offered one opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's like, oh, do you want to go to
Afghanistan for this volleyball
[SPEAKER_01]: tournament?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, I want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, no, no, you're not going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of during the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now, things are not the friendliest,
unfortunately, between the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Afghanistan relations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bring up such a great point that
there's so many different varieties even
[SPEAKER_00]: within one country that it almost feels as
though as United States consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we sort of exotify it to try and make it
seem as though there's something more
[SPEAKER_00]: special to it, where it's just another
region of cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like we don't overly hype grapes
grown in different regions of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like look at the wine and the final
product and say, this is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like with cannabis,
we're looking at it and trying to exotify
[SPEAKER_00]: these different cultures that it's a
little uncouth almost, it feels like,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give respect where it is deserved,
because if you look at Morocco,
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan, India, these places have
been, and not to say that we haven't,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the U.S., there's Native American
tribes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned the Hope Mound Builders.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the U.S., there's cannabis THC resin in
their clay pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were not only growing it and
cultivating it, they were smoking it in
[SPEAKER_01]: pipes just like stuff you'd see today,
like a little glass spoon piece or a thing
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Asia, Africa, literally
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you're saying, I think sometimes
we maybe get this, even the idea that the
[SPEAKER_01]: term exotic or za za, you know,
the exotic got shortened to za,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then za became za za.
[SPEAKER_01]: But silly terminology aside, maybe we're
just getting older or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the reality is, Afghani hash was
popular for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a lot of hash and it was really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got exported, same with Morocco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moroccan hash, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rift Mountains are known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like Humboldt is in the Emerald
Triangle, Mendocino, that whole area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegan Doja's from up a little bit further
north.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say DojaDNA is his actual breeder
account, because the Vegan Doja is more of
[SPEAKER_01]: his personal page.
[SPEAKER_01]: But DojaDNA, my buddy Dan, the guy that I
work with in making seeds, he's up from
[SPEAKER_01]: Del Norte, California, Crescent City area.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a strain called Crescent City Kush
that was really fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: His thing was, in the early 2000s,
gas was just not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't really get a good clone of
like OG for cheap or easily without paying
[SPEAKER_01]: five, 10, 15, $20,000 or something crazy
for like a cut or like a flat of cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people held that shit really tightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a little bit of it got out there,
he was able to start crossing that into
[SPEAKER_01]: some of his stuff and then made the gas
available to like any of his patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, family, whoever wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I try to, you know, keep in that
vein and make the stuff available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've given out plenty of free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole F2, you know, I never sold F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent them out as testers and had
over 100 people grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So got a lot of feedback interpretations
on what the different environments would
[SPEAKER_01]: produce, what different nutrient regimes
will produce, what types of stressors
[SPEAKER_01]: canning won't cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeing indoor, outdoor greenhouse was
really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the different concentrates people
make with it outside of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have stuff, things that I know we
would.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, after hearing you talk for
years about the different breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that you've done and how you've
been able to get these seeds out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and see all these different
phenotypic expressions based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: different environmental factors of each
different grow and each different personal
[SPEAKER_00]: touch that every cultivator has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really build like a vast library
of knowledge that you can then boil down
[SPEAKER_00]: and distill into something very useful for
when you're sending out seeds to people in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to kind of give the best
information available for newer growers as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I thought it was really a
great point that you brought up that like
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different regions that we do
sort of try to exemplify into this exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology where a lot of it is just like
a cultural tradition of the area that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been something past from generation to
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually when we encounter it,
we're enjoying sort of this, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: product of these different cultures that
have been developed over, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds, if not close to a thousand or
more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with the families, like those
regions we're talking about, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they know their great grandpa was
doing it, who taught their grandpa,
[SPEAKER_01]: who taught their dad, and their dad taught
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a lot of cases, they haven't
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're still using, you know,
the same coat manure or whatever it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilize with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are using modern stuff from
pesticides to fertilizers, which I do
[SPEAKER_01]: think changes flavors and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them have, if you see any of
the 24 regions that we went through and
[SPEAKER_01]: listed from the Afghani selection or
Afghani selection, or even like looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: like India.
[SPEAKER_01]: India is all not just one strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I finally learned the pronunciation
after one of my listeners on our podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: corrected me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was calling it Kerala, but it's
K-E-R-A-L-A and it's Kerala.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kerala.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody from Kerala, India messaged me
and said, Hey, it's actually pronounced
[SPEAKER_01]: Kerala.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked into it and turned out
they're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have listeners in Kerala,
India, but Kyle Breeder, the reason that
[SPEAKER_01]: we know this is because Kyle was growing
seeds from Kerala and maybe he got them
[SPEAKER_01]: from that listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was maybe something separate from my
interaction, but he grew this and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a crazy lawn plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he grew it on the side and like it
went like around a four by four and like
[SPEAKER_01]: up the walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like the most crazy bananas
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like super tall and lanky and just
the one where he kept turning the pot over
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like drill a hole in the side to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard plenty of stories like
that where you just get a something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not, you're not used to growing because it
just is, it's used to a different
[SPEAKER_00]: environment based on all the years of it's
sort of bottlenecking and genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, whether it be through like
local horticultural practices that have
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of curated this land race species,
or if it's even like a wild population
[SPEAKER_00]: that has no human interaction with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you can just get these crazy
expressions that if you put it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment setting,
you're going to, I mean, it's just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: new learning experience every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get like 30 feet tall in the wild
with no help out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to give it nutrients and lighting
and try and contain it in a confined space
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, I don't think he realized the
fire he was fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people say,
I want land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want land race because like you said,
there has been a bottlenecking of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, especially in like certain
pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people out there that are
still traveling the world and hand
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it's maybe tainted quote
unquote, because people have traveled and
[SPEAKER_01]: given them modern genetics and it's
interlaced into the pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder and harder to find the
truer land races, but they still are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually everything reverts back to
what is in the natural area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only have so many other seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if they bred something into it,
a lot of them don't necessarily love the
[SPEAKER_01]: new stuff as much as they think they
might.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they get it from some person,
they see photos and smell it and smoke it
[SPEAKER_01]: one time and they get a little strain
tolerant after they grow it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, this isn't actually as
good as the stuff we've grown here for
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to go back to the
stuff we've grown for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got our grandma's stash of it
over here, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there is a sort of rose
colored glasses of thinking the old stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: is always better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then remembering that there's a reason
that people like DJ Short went through the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of taking like his best land races
that he grew, struggled to find like any
[SPEAKER_01]: good ones in the bag seeds that were being
imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the fire that he found in
there would make it more manageable by
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing it into one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately started finding stuff
like blueberry and flow and kind of cool
[SPEAKER_01]: unique expressions that he could,
like you were saying with the velvet
[SPEAKER_01]: punch, him growing it out and having so
many different people grow it out or
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it out at a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this feedback that shows you a lot
about the plant and how it expresses,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you're making your own
seeds and you're not worried like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, should I pop one, two, three,
five?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like popping hundreds or
thousands and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that scale, you get to learn a lot
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see things that maybe you
would have never seen just, you would have
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately just by the numbers,
if you pop 10 at a time over and over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over, eventually you're going to
get to the hundreds and thousands and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see those rare things that maybe
are one in a hundred or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think often there's stuff that's
like one in 16 and people only pop like
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just pop a big enough,
that's what I learned when I started
[SPEAKER_01]: making the velvet punch F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a one in 16 phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a physical morphological thing that
I called the sawtooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had like a double zigzag on
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it was exactly like one
in 16 for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then like I remembered back to my old
science learning and the little charts,
[SPEAKER_01]: little punnet squares, punnet squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, wait, I kind of make,
I thought it was one in 15 because I
[SPEAKER_01]: usually popped 15 of a thing just for
whatever reason, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was because I had 15 cups,
to be honest with you for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 15 cups like fit into my little tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, that's how many seeds I can
reasonably pop in this little tiny veg
[SPEAKER_01]: space that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 15 was what it ended up working out
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe I did 16 initially and like one
of them broke or got lost or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't been replaced, but whatever the
reason is.
[SPEAKER_01]: With larger numbers, I sent out a hundred
people, at least 10 seeds, usually,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 10 or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of that hundred people, I was over a
hundred people, I sent seeds, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: like 150 and like a hundred grew them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of that hundred, they grew like
between, some grew all 10, some grew five,
[SPEAKER_01]: some grew three, but like that puts up
into the thousands of seeds that were
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could just go through and kind of
map how many people got this expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like almost exactly one in 16,
like within like one percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was pretty fascinating, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science is something that should be
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real science that's done with rigor that
has been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done everything and replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a lot of criticism and
cynicism for good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of science doesn't replicate the
gold standard of what makes science good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer become the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a wishful thinking almost for
some, but I'm from the world of,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm from like a science that's not
necessarily even looked at as like a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: science, but I still consider we need
those gold standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the psychology,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even with that, it's almost more
important because of how subjective all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different approaches are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be so thorough with
everything and you have to try and account
[SPEAKER_00]: for every single variable so that you can
make it reproducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's one of the reasons why like
whenever I would make seeds and test out
[SPEAKER_00]: my seeds that I've made, I would always
hunt a full pack because that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to think like that's a
representation of what a customer would
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can't find something in a pack,
then I didn't do my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's problems within that pack,
then I didn't do my job and I shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I've only ever released like a
couple packs of seeds because I was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never satisfied personally after
growing out plenty of other seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: other reputable breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in the cultivation space
that I'm in having access to all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of elite cuts or,
or different genetics that are the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are desired within the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those are very stable and
they, you can push extremely high
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical conductivity in your irrigation
and crazy dry backs and extremely high
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD and extremely high CO2 and heats and
colds and all these different aspects of a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that in some cases, if your genetics
are just a little bit finicky and they
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to throw an intersex trait here
and there, if they, if they run into a
[SPEAKER_00]: stressor event, yeah, you, you just can't
really have that in a commercial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always kind of in my breeding
efforts thinking, oh, this'll like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see this in a commercial
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see it get out to more
than just one or two growers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have it available because I always
personally have considered cannabis like a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the two 15 days when I was in
California, having access to like some
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice strains and stuff and from
people that were really caring,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it makes me think of like mad farmer
up in Humboldt and his lavender and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever you'd see that at a
dispensary in the Bay area or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like, Oh my God, I need to get
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to put me to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cure my headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make me hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to do all these things that I
need it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consistency behind it was so key
due to just the years and years and years
[SPEAKER_00]: of effort put into something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a major effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a labor of love really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept the cherry pie for many years
because it was the one thing that was
[SPEAKER_01]: helping me sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I found that high CBN RSO
was equally, if not more effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: that made me not so diligent about holding
that cut so tightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave it back to the person who gave
it to me thinking that they would be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they ended up not keeping it alive for
very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cherry pie that I was running for
so long and love so much is no longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good reminder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to if you really do love stuff to
keep it around, there's like a couple that
[SPEAKER_01]: got away from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that's funny that you were
talking about is the idea of kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you didn't say it this way,
but I think some people think that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: like bulletproof genetics or like rock
solid stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some stuff is clearly more stable than
others for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anything with cookies in it is going
to be or chems or OGs stuff that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: like begets like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes from her literally everything
on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's her right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, you see stuff like
jealousy or whatever is run pretty hard in
[SPEAKER_01]: the markets and wedding cakes and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're run and people figure out in their
system how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it feels rock solid and stable because
you'll see people run it for years and
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have problems in their system
indoors and a hydroponic system under a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain type of lighting in a certain type
of environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get Canada legalizes and
then they get all these greenhouse grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Massive ass, unlimited square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they take all these same cuts that are
bulletproof and they put them into those
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses and they start herming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start not yielding like they don't
even look the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't smell the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are susceptible to molds and mildews
that maybe they didn't even know were
[SPEAKER_01]: problems until they took it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes there is what we think to
be a stable, a rock solid genetic that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets exposed when you put it in the hands
of hundreds or thousands or different of
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think you can make any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any kind of a strain, no matter how
bulletproof herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: One person I've heard vehemently defend
their strain is Rick from Mr. Soul C99 of
[SPEAKER_01]: Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says the Cinderella 99 will not herm
and so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notoriously said he would never release
stuff if it had herm stuff in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could tell you if you go look around
on the forums enough under both of those
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you'll find herms under both of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of it does come down to
growers have to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: accountable of what their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing outdoor, obviously you
don't have as much control, but you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to like realize that there are factors
that can make a plant go intersect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think outdoor is actually more rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think greenhouse indoor is where you're
going to see the most herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for sure, that's when we have the most
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we have the most control,
we're most likely to underestimate certain
[SPEAKER_01]: factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little things, light leaks, ambient lights
like a red light or green light,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even a green headlamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that you can wear a green
headlamp and flower into your flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I'm here to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to push back on that just a
little bit, just from my own personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, because we run green lights in
all of our rooms whenever we're applying
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have any any intersex issues
or anything that throws late flower
[SPEAKER_00]: nanners or any pollination events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just ask a follow up question on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to be specific, like I know people
that have green lights in their room,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're like older, like CFL bulbs,
they're softer lights, they're hung up in
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain way that they're not like
blasting the plant with these green
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a... But do you have like a
modern LED green headlamp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something that's you're wearing on
your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: We use LED T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that might be... Green T5s that are
at an array across the ceiling basically
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide light for movement through the
room in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would avoid is the specifically
these head mounted lamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older, like a really old one,
if it's like so soft that you can barely
[SPEAKER_01]: even see, that might be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I got a newer one.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even like your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, I used to do this and I never
had intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, look at how much that's blowing
out my camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I usually go in there with my
camera, my phone on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blowing it up so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like removing you from the rendering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got washed out of the frame there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just like one single Samsung
LM301 on the back of a Galaxy,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these headlamps have more
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like another single source of
light I have right here, it's another
[SPEAKER_01]: single chip.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one completely washes me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little flashlight that's
handheld, can fit, you know, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes a double A, triple A or
CR123.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something like that would definitely,
definitely make your plants break their
[SPEAKER_01]: SCOTO period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for sure that dark cycle, I think
Bugby's research has been showing that
[SPEAKER_01]: something like 0.0 like less than one PAR
is able to be detected by the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to say that's going to harm the
plant necessarily, but they're noticing
[SPEAKER_01]: those changes and pitch black is ideal for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing, the exception is with
foliar spray is because like certain stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to spray under intense
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your grow lights are intense,
which they should be, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're not like in a place where
outdoor, you can kind of do it early
[SPEAKER_01]: morning or late evening and get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But middle of the day, you're going to fry
your plant just like you would if you did
[SPEAKER_01]: under your grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are those considerations and
a lot of plants, maybe they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to green light, over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why that green would be
less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at a spectral graph of
the PAR chart, green is right smack dab in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like green doesn't
photosynthesize like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that it reflects some green because
that's what our eyes see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that essentially that's
going to be the least taken up color.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's been studies that show like
green penetrates deeper and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has, I think, I personally believe
that has a usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the growth process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that makes me a little bit
concerned in terms of this is just to new
[SPEAKER_01]: growers out there trying to eliminate as
many possible things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say like there are aren't
bulletproof strains that can't get away
[SPEAKER_01]: with it because I know people that have
had light leaks in their tent with a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: light in the next because they like leave
one flap open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally they'd have a situation where
that when the lights come on, they close
[SPEAKER_01]: the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they went out of town and then the
person didn't take care of the situation
[SPEAKER_01]: type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like half the strains in the room
hermed, but then half of them didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shows that some stuff is more
bulletproof than others in terms of light
[SPEAKER_01]: leaks during the dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of trying to whenever I see a
intersex trait, I haven't actually in
[SPEAKER_01]: micro, which I'm fortunate because I tried
to, to the most of my ability,
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate any possible cause overwatering,
underwatering, root binding, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: high heat, really low humidity,
really high humidity, um, interrupting the
[SPEAKER_01]: dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistently during flower and just too
much stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you break the plant apart
completely, like not just like super
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping, like some people really,
or like a windstorm and things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: might come, that might be a time you could
see herming outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, generally if you avoid quote
unquote, the common stressors,
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that won't make a plant herm,
which sometimes new growers don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know to avoid some of these pitfalls,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They, their plant gets root bound because
they just kept it in that pot and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: realize because they watch a bunch of
Instagram posts where people pull their
[SPEAKER_01]: thing out and it's just roots wrapped all
the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, that looks cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want my plant to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wait until that happens to
transplant and maybe they're male
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinates and a veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing people don't talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male plants can start throwing pollen
while they're basically seedlings a few
[SPEAKER_01]: inches tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the, the bracts at the
internodes pollinated that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, my plants already seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens five or six seeds off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny thing is if you put it in a
flower, like it won't, the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant won't be seeded unless it continues
to receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know some people that actually use
that as like a strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had your stuff super long until it
shows sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll pollinate it to get like five,
six, 10, however many seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll bring it into flower and
they kind of get a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't think seeded bud is as
bad as people make it out to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all remember it being bad because it
was like Mexican brickweed that was
[SPEAKER_01]: imported and garbage and lost all its
terpenes and was probably sprayed with who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows what and grown with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the best methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, it's not the same as
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow your own seed, it even like
indoor outdoor greenhouse doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's going to be, it's an
inconvenience to break up the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for dry sift though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got to break all the,
you got to shuck all those seeds anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just making dry sift out of
that and your little trim bin or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you got, sit there with a couple of shows
on and you won't even know that it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a while you got grams and
grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of, uh, of Keefe either to press or just
top your bowls and yeah, beautiful golden
[SPEAKER_01]: Keefe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it smokes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even like press it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you clean it up with static tech,
that stuff is like dabble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can press out the flags, but,
um, I've, I've seen like, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people talk about how like they'll
get different terpene profiles on the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded plant versus the unseeded plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, the plants, yeah,
it's immune response or whatever to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I always find that super
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one thing I always notice is if it's
a citrusy leaning mom, then it just gets
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really pungent when, when it's a,
when it's seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got great hash makings there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost wondered that with the velvet
punch, that's what made me grow out
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple runs, a stress test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like the non-seeded runs
where I just grew it for flower because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'd have accurate descriptions of what
people are going to get when they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow it out themselves, because most
people aren't making seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was actually so blown away by the
seed run that like some of the elements in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, um, I wanted to ensure that they
were still within the phenotypes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: F2s and F3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, those were what I was
selecting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, and it was there to start,
like to give credit, like the mother of
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a purple punch, which a lot of
people say purple punchless, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it yourself and take it to nine or 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely got a strong high.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take it 10 weeks, most people
aren't willing to take a plant 70 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm not saying that you have to
63, I think is solid, but 70, I think a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of strains are just better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like cherry pie was another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take it, um, the guy who gave it to
me also named Jack, he was, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm not going to say where he's
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually he was Polish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can say it on a go shit, Polish Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for the story sake, he gave me the
cherry pie initially and, um, he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good at nine weeks, but it's really
good at 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first time I grew it, I took it 10
weeks and goddamn, if he wasn't right,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually never ended up growing at nine
weeks because it was so good at the 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, I'm always going to
take it to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think sometimes it's worth the extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you don't have the, you know,
leeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is there's personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, velvet punch, if you take it
at 10 weeks, it's going to be danker and
[SPEAKER_01]: gassier than if you take it at eight weeks
or nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fruitier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't get as stoned, but it'll taste
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might even look a little bit,
um, it depends on like what your grows
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people in the later stages of
flower, their plants start to look a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're fading them out with nutrient
and that can lead to necrosis and other
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are unintended that aren't
just the actual fall fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's more of a, you know, they're,
they're flushing it and it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to nutrients and it's starving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people starve the plant and I
actually personally do think starving it
[SPEAKER_01]: is a, there's going to be a benefit in the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll smoke smoother in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people argue that the
flush doesn't work and yada yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, um, fade will happen without a
flush and like a organic soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm blanking on the name right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a little stoned off my bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the term where you start to see the
anthocyanins and, uh, carotenoids start to
[SPEAKER_01]: show those purples and reds and pinks and
even the yellows and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, can be part of the senescence process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every strain is a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like a Rasta flag one, one time I
was like, I had like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the red, yellow and green just as it was
fading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, interesting just to see like
the different, but, um, I will say that
[SPEAKER_01]: purples can go into black, but a lot of
people don't realize, uh, greens can go to
[SPEAKER_01]: black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the talking about the Afghani
earlier, some of that stuff will get
[SPEAKER_01]: black, but it never goes purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just green, green, green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it like, like vibrant purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, yeah, it goes straight to almost
like lack of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I've definitely seen that as
well, especially outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you get those like, uh,
late October harvests, uh, early September
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests, you can really start to see
those colors come out depending on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are in the, um, in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a little bit higher up on the
latitude, then yeah, I've seen it happen
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like within a week almost goes from
green to completely black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and so I'm going to steer
the conversation a little bit back to a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of these questions that I have,
cause we've just been riffing here and I
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a great flow so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do want to find out what was
your first experience growing and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't even have to be with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is your first memory of,
uh, growing a plant and, uh, starting your
[SPEAKER_00]: journey as a, as a grower overall?
[SPEAKER_01]: My first one is going to be kind of
comical because, uh, I wasn't the grower
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was the case with the first
several grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great cause I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this wasn't cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next door neighbor, uh, Vincenzo,
he was a cool dude, but they grew their
[SPEAKER_01]: own tomatoes for their pasta sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, his wife would home make pasta
sauce and pasta and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, he gave me a BB gun to
sit on the back porch and they had a
[SPEAKER_01]: little fence around their tomato garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hung a soda can or a pop can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we would call it in the
Midwest at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just like a little aluminum can on the
top of a stick and squirrels were a big
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The squirrels would come and eat his
tomatoes and he didn't want to eat the
[SPEAKER_01]: squirrel cause it's not necessarily,
some people like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like it necessarily,
but I'm not saying it's bad eating or good
[SPEAKER_01]: eating, but neither here or there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was my first lesson in IPM or
integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go back way back to the
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hire a five year old, hire a young boy
with a BB gun who's a highly motivated to
[SPEAKER_01]: go out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I'll give you a nickel for
every, you know, this wasn't like that
[SPEAKER_01]: long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nickel wasn't much, but I was just
young and dumb and having fun more with
[SPEAKER_01]: the BB gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care about the nickels,
but a squirrel would come up and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: eat his, uh, tomatoes and I'd shoot that
can and to make a loud ping, the squirrel
[SPEAKER_01]: would fucking go crazy and jump off the
fence or jump to the next tree and just
[SPEAKER_01]: run away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was my first experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: With growing as far as I can actually
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my parents and family were not
gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had like a tree in my front yard,
just like random shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but other than maybe like some berries
that were on a city planetary on the
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewalk and like nothing actually grew
where I was at that we were into sports
[SPEAKER_01]: and didn't necessarily have the time that
was dedicated to the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, the first thing that I
actually participated in the growth of was
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when I was a teenager,
started smoking in middle school.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother started dealing and he was a
couple of years older than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, eventually I figured out where it
was coming from through the train.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went up the source and,
uh, there was actually a couple of local
[SPEAKER_01]: grows just like happens now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in random neighborhoods, they'd have
people with grow setups and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up kind of asking, like,
can I help like in some way, just like get
[SPEAKER_01]: a joint to here and there, like I didn't
even want payment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to smoke cause I was smoking
so much of my brother's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I was like, I just want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not have to pester him for something he's
selling and making money off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up, thankfully it was a friend
through football.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't think I would have ever
gotten into the grow situation because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was at the time cannabis was selling
for like six or $7,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking early 2000s and in the
Cleveland area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot that you're from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was born and raised till I was
18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pricy, pricey stuff there at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So considering that the crew that I was
working with, all I cared about was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting six a pound into a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 600 watt lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran a reverse DWC system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a DIY system, Home Depot buckets
with a reverse or recirculating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a recirculating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like they would go from like one to
the next, the next, the next, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: already got you recirculating,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I was just the water boy
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, basically my job was to sweep up
the leaves that were pruned off and then
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the little blue lab trench in,
stick it in to the buckets and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were all the right EC and,
uh, pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go through to verify that the
reservoir was matching up to each plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure that the reservoirs had
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause sometimes they're with DIY systems,
weird shit would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it would leak or crack or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd have to replace a bucket here and
there or, you know, uh, figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was making, oh, there's a tube that's
clogged, you know, and figure out why is
[SPEAKER_01]: it clogged?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get unclogged?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that process, sort of just being
around the plants, learning like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, oh, well the EC is low and they start
to look like this or the EC is high and
[SPEAKER_01]: they start to look like this as you're
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though I was just the water boy,
I got a lot of experience in just seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: what a healthy plant is supposed to look
like and you know, how to kind of be
[SPEAKER_01]: around a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, unfortunately, you know, bad things
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There and, uh, the person who ran the
operation got taken out by competition and
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get too much into the details,
but there was like crime scene tape when I
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up one day and just, uh,
unfortunately was never able to go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: that operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple years later, I was able to go
to California for college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was in California, I met my
freshman roommate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I was randomly assigned to live
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started growing weed in the windowsill
of our dorm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he just had a literally,
he was selling weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny because like, there's a
history of this in my family, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause my mom, when she was in college,
her roommate, she told me this like long
[SPEAKER_01]: before, like one of the reasons she was
like, Oh, I don't, I don't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: My roommate in college grew it on my
windowsill blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that seemed like such a,
you know, hokey hook story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sure enough, and it happened and,
uh, you know, same thing happened to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved cannabis at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking since I was,
you know, young teen and played football,
[SPEAKER_01]: had lots of injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And didn't, didn't even realize I was
self-medicating for head injuries and
[SPEAKER_01]: bodily injuries and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even that psychological stuff,
but getting back to the growth side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when I moved out here, my roommate who
grew, he was sold and he had found a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: in one of the better bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, this shit was really
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to try and grow this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he got a Starbucks paper cup and
filled it with soil from our little flower
[SPEAKER_01]: beds in the dormitory and put it in there,
watered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure enough, it germinated and it was like
the last month we were living there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it stayed in that cup for less than a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved out to a little apartment and we
were the very last one, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, maybe we even chose it because of
this, but it was like all the way at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the parking row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, we were the last two spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody else would really even get too
close to where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it went around, there was like a
fenced in area and little grass patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just had like a nice sunny
grassy patch there that was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: private.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just threw it in a pot,
got some soil and this thing had grown
[SPEAKER_01]: like six and a half, seven feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it sweet skunk because it was
sweet and skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, man, it was, it kind of got us
off on, off to the races.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked into the medical, uh,
licensing, got our medical guards and one
[SPEAKER_01]: of his friends, cause he was from this
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, um, his dad had property and so
we set up a grow at his property and we
[SPEAKER_01]: dug like trenches next to the fence
because we're like, these things are gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: get tall, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be as tall as your fence
or higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did, we set them up and killed it
there and ended up finding even more local
[SPEAKER_01]: spot and gotten to doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, while we were doing this,
my buddy who was selling was more into it
[SPEAKER_01]: than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was learning all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like along for the ride,
you know, it's labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he got into like organics and
Korean natural farming and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was learning about like master chose
techniques and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got into organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it tastes good, easy to do in terms
of, uh, once you get it set up and
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling, uh, it seems simple, basically
water only at a certain point and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have certain inputs here and there to,
you know, supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he got me into that side of things,
but, um, we went through college,
[SPEAKER_01]: graduated and unfortunately like we had a
home break in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a couple of my roommates and myself
admittedly, like got sketched,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some guy broke into our house with a
gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so thankfully we all survived,
um, pulled a fake gun on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: My roommate had a BB gun and, uh,
thankfully it was like painted black and
[SPEAKER_01]: yelled, get the fuck out of my house type
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did, but we didn't realize like he jumped
out the window that he came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought he was still in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like come to my door and I'm like
locked in my room, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually studying and they're like,
somebody's in the house with a gun,
[SPEAKER_01]: like call 9-1-1.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't find her phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, all right, I'm fucking calling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make hand me this fake
gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like pretending on the phone with
9-1-1, like, I have a gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody comes up to these stairs,
I'm going to shoot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if the person's in the house,
that they are hopefully not incentivized
[SPEAKER_01]: to come up the stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was all bluff, but definitely
I won't get into the gun side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Side of things, but learned from that
situation to not have fake guns and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for home invasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll leave it at that, but,
uh, never be caught with my pants down
[SPEAKER_01]: like that ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, I was stark ass naked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to bed at the time I slept
naked and my roommate's girlfriend was the
[SPEAKER_01]: one who counted on the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it was just such a weird night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the cops came over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our house got cased because like
the cops came over like two hours before
[SPEAKER_01]: it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sadly they were looking for a missing
person and like, there was no missing
[SPEAKER_01]: person at the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a made up person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the person who broke into our
house made it look like we were like the
[SPEAKER_01]: boy who cried wolf kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the cops were just out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to come back out there,
but it was like for an armed robbery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they ended up coming like 15 minutes
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was there, but thanks to their
credit, uh, STD or whoever it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they cleared the area and no one was
in the house and no one was outside the
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and a few weeks later, that person got
busted breaking into somebody else's house
[SPEAKER_01]: who held him up with a shotgun and went to
the cops got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, but that ultimately it leads back
to the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking feel a little bit like
somebody doing the weave over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the ultimate point of that story was
the guy that I was growing with outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my other two roommates sort of turned
their back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't weak guys and they're like,
we can't live with this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too dangerous, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, I just graduated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my first professional job in a,
you know, the space that I'm working in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, provide services to special
needs, individuals, autism, cerebral
[SPEAKER_01]: palsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, well I just
graduated college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can move out of my college house,
like move into like, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to go tour this apartment
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was more professional, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I go and tour it and it was only like
a three person place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, there wasn't a spot for this
fourth guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just thought, um, going to tour
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got there, they're like,
this is the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got like three more people touring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't sign right now, like you're
not going to get a spot and where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: at, admittedly, it's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places to live that are decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I made the mistake of kind of
getting pressure tactic into signing my
[SPEAKER_01]: lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately didn't realize I kind of
signed the death note of that relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: with a guy that I really am sad that I'm
not still connected with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's my homie, Zach zigzag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know if he'll ever hear this,
but I need to fucking reach out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, no, that was the guy that you had
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, started growing with your,
your roommate in college and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genuinely, like it, it hurts man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there actually like emotional,
like thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, man, he was a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he married the girl and I
introduced him to our freshman year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I told him because of situation,
I was like, you better, like if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, cause she was a really good
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, if you're going to do what
you're going to do and like, you better
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking marry this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause she's a great person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm happy for both of them and
their little child.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just had, so I'm happy that I were
friends on Facebook or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see him from afar and I'm just happy
to see that he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that being said, like I'm really like
close friends with other people that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have falling outs with like that,
that I haven't kept in touch just because
[SPEAKER_01]: so busy with work and life and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how things go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a hard enough to,
uh, just, you know, get everything taken
[SPEAKER_01]: care of, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always heard growing up means
growing apart and a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, just you move or you,
you change your, your schedules and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, what was a four 20 hangout session
before becomes like, Hey man, I might have
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes at nine 30 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's like, I'm going to be
tucked into bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up at 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: for work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know, man, I learned that thankfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like my one buddy, he moved to,
uh, just one town over and like we had
[SPEAKER_01]: just gotten our licenses, like we loved to
drive 15 minute drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in Ohio and I was like,
we're going to hang out all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, he got new friends, like they
hang out with the new friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, this was my best friend from
like, you know, kindergarten through
[SPEAKER_01]: however long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's, and we're, we're still
friendly, you know, from afar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just like the effort it takes to
even my, like my family, like my dad,
[SPEAKER_01]: when he moved an hour South for work and
stuff like that, like we'd only see his
[SPEAKER_01]: family on holidays, like Thanksgiving and
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and it's just, um, I moved
obviously far away from my family,
[SPEAKER_01]: five hour flight at the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, I could see him just as much
as I would if I moved one hour South in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohio, you know, so it's, it's really,
uh, we get busy and that's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that makes growing so difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, I guess, ultimate point of what I
wanted to focus the most on the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what I haven't even gotten to
yet, which is, uh, the girls that I'm most
[SPEAKER_01]: proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess are the ones that I did myself and
a lot of people shit on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like so far you've been talking kind
of about how you've like, we're introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: to seeing cannabis growing and,
um, you know, your, your very first
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction into being the water boy and
the leaf boy and, and going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just, uh, kind of being the gopher
of just, of getting, getting what needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be got done without being given sort of
the formal education of what, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: or why you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when did you start to dive into,
um, like either as a home grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like kind of being more intent on,
uh, your processes or, uh, did you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: finding more of a, um, commercial or,
uh, or another, like working with people
[SPEAKER_00]: that were producing for the medical or rec
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I, like I had, like I said,
I had the falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going from there, I guess later on,
I personally moved away for grad school to
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I moved back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of even lost more touch with a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when I moved back here,
there happened to be a hydro store right
[SPEAKER_01]: down my street and I was working at a
delivery service for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the guy at the delivery service
growing his own, like in his closet,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, or like on a balcony,
like a couple of plants here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: just from seeds that he got from,
uh, bags that were selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was doing it organic, but,
um, he didn't really, he was doing some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the techniques my other buddy had done
before KNF type stuff, but he wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: having as much success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just real little plants and it was good
smoke, but it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one foot tall plant by one foot wide type
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, nothing as quite as impressive as
what I was used to seeing in high times
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to like figure out a system
that I could grow like a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: looking, healthy plant in a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found like these space bucket type
things where you could do like Home Depot
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets or like totes like stacked up and
like do lighting all around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my wife, uh, graciously offered one of
the closets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our very small space,
we don't have a whole bunch of square
[SPEAKER_01]: footage, 400 square feet out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very, very, very close to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, don't feel sorry for me living in
a tiny house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose this lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so Cal near the ocean, 400 square feet
is not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was at 400 square feet in
Portland, Oregon for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, in the dead of winter,
that just gets to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bundled up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I totally, I couldn't relate
because being from Ohio, cold is cold and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's not fun being cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she sacrificed this one closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, it was kind of a borderline of
being necessary for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was lightly being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told her about my experience growing
with like my buddies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medical licenses are like a dime a
dozen out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really easily get your,
in the two 15 days, you know, just grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, well, I'll go talk to
the doctor again, get my license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did got my license and I was like,
all right, let's get growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a tent that literally fit the exact
dimensions of the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is, I had to take out the inner
moldings of the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's like a crown molding on the
door panel that shuts into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to like pull those off so that
like the frames could fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then like the top frame didn't
quite fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I built a wooden structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, is it like, uh, one of those
dimensions that's not an actual foot by
[SPEAKER_00]: foot dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 20 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 18 inch or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three feet by one and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the weirdest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly one and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one and like, it's definitely a,
is it exactly 36 inches across or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: like 32 or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 36 wide, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's, um, it's like just over one
and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could look up the thing on my Amazon
purchase from wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I feel like there's a standard closet
size for like small closets like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got a tent from a buddy when I
was first getting into this and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, this is the weirdest dimensions for
a tent when everything else that you see
[SPEAKER_00]: online is like within like, you know,
12, like multiples of 12 inches on either,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depth, width, height,
all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I was just like, why would anybody
want a tent this size?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved and I, I saw in a,
in like, one of my moves that this frame
[SPEAKER_00]: fit perfectly into a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what is, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they even figure this out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, yeah, there must be a standard
closet size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 36 by 20 inch by 62 inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like five feet tall, three feet
wide, and like two and a half feet deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you reached your arm into
like a coat closet, it's going to like hit
[SPEAKER_01]: the back, you know, like your arm is
probably going to be longer than the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice because I can reach all the
way across and get to the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The back of the plants and it's enough
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've had as many as six plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work out with two in there now in the
earth box, but I was, when I got started
[SPEAKER_01]: doing cocoa, because there's a hydro
store, I could hit it with a baseball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I threw a baseball from my house,
it was so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I ended up going in there and
just getting some basic stuff to get set
[SPEAKER_01]: up and what they were pushing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like many hydro stores and many places
rightfully do, I think cocoa coir is a
[SPEAKER_01]: good media and it's simple enough to get
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met some of the guys who worked
there and one of them is like a real old
[SPEAKER_01]: OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he kind of took me under his wing
a little bit and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of got all the same stuff that
he did and just kind of do exactly what he
[SPEAKER_01]: did to try and have success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought way too much light for my space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a three by three light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I had a three by one and a half,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was over lit to start with this
ceramic metal halide, a 315 CMH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like a little super sprouter bulb
and a dome or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had germinate with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them going for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put them under the CMH and push
it all the way to the top of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then gradually they'd grow up towards
it and like lower it down fairly quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: switched to an led that was appropriately
spaced or sized for my space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a local company called timber
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're now called high Grove LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they don't make an led that's small
enough for my space anymore, but they now
[SPEAKER_01]: do like bar LEDs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't speak to the quality of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that the Cobb style that I got
from them is still running strong like
[SPEAKER_01]: years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you've been running it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I think five or six years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got it in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, it still pulls two grams a watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, that's great for new growers
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cause Cobbs are one of those
things also that run pretty hot and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that, uh, some people have
failures on those, but if it's built well,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was built like another 10,
dude, the, the, um, it's like aircraft
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum, but the heat sinks are like,
it looks like giant hedgehogs off the
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal rods coming up and my exhaust fan is
right next to where the light is hung.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that heat from the driver,
from the Cobbs, it just drifts right from
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the tent where with the ceramic
metal halide, the way that it was cased
[SPEAKER_01]: that metal casing, and then that light,
it was a reflector, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It throw throws all that light,
but also heat down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would throw it down onto the plants
and then get pushed up and then cycled out
[SPEAKER_01]: where the heat, you can barely even feel
it when you put your hand under the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, even a Cobb, that's pretty intense a
few inches away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd went by that metric, you'd burn
the crap out of your plants because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's way too much light getting to
where it feels hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found a, my girl has a little,
uh, video where he found this doggo,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, apps is what it's called a Lux light
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did a side-by-side comparison with
like a $300 light meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he did a graph like, all right,
so you basically just do like times 10 and
[SPEAKER_01]: it gives you your exact par from the Lux
or whatever, or divide by 10 or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I never ended up buying a
light meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used that and it's worked
fantastically in terms of knowing how much
[SPEAKER_01]: light I'm given to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so that's kind of where I'm at in
terms of like gear and growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I started, like I mentioned in Coco
and, um, that kind of OG took me under his
[SPEAKER_01]: wing and I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started in like three gallon pots and,
uh, I've edged two blue dreams for way too
[SPEAKER_01]: long till they showed sex because that's
how we used to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was growing Afghani under HPS and
like, I just was, I remember it back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what did I do when I was indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, we've edged them as big
as they could get, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They started showing sex and they were
clones, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that was a different system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was averting sort of my old ways set me
up for not success in a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: metric, because with the HPS, you could
grow clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show pistols relatively quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're old clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sexually mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll show pistols and veg almost
always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, especially the one that we were
running this Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so old and tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd been running for years, but,
um, it was an AK 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called it, but it wasn't the AK 47
from Syria seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Afghan Kush that flowered in 47
days from like Afghanistan, like the Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, and it had like little baseball
bat calls and it was just like a super
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, going back to like my girl,
I was like, I loved blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, if I'm going to start
my own home grow, might as well give
[SPEAKER_01]: myself my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of my favorite strains,
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got some blue dream and,
uh, it was seeds, but the seeds were from
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt seed organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And admittedly they are honest about what
it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was feminized, cross of DJ shorts,
blueberry to Shanti Baba from Mr. Nice
[SPEAKER_01]: seed companies, super silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who don't know, blue dream
is a Santa Cruz Hayes cross to DJ shorts,
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry Santa Cruz Hayes is pretty
similar to super silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's even some that speculate it
might just be a super silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I can't verify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think Santa Cruz Hayes might be its
own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think the blue dream cut the Santa
Cruz blue dream cut is like special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is my favorite, one of my
favorites, if not my favorite,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's what people made their
fortunes off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, I mean, 10, 12 pounder outdoors
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a huge yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was kind of like purple punch
because like once something gets super
[SPEAKER_01]: popular, it also becomes super unpopular
because a lot of people get their hands on
[SPEAKER_01]: it or say that they have their hands on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow it out, grow up poorly and
harvest it early and then sell it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, Oh, blue dream sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even get high out and it doesn't
even taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, you know, you got it from
the guy who was doing it for cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the guy who did it because he loved it
and because he wants the dankest weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: happens to make some money on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that point aside, getting back to
the grow, the blue dream that I've edged,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 60 days in cocoa, got them in like
three gallon pots by the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, like I said, I'm in a five foot
tall tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, those things I put like trellis
netting up, thankfully, because it burst
[SPEAKER_01]: it through that first, the first trellis
netting didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second trellis netting didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third, I set up a third layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I like cut out the first layer
and set up a fourth layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I just kept trellising it and
kept bending it over because the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: just got so out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It filled every square inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a crazy harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud didn't look great at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I made a ton of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have hash from that fucking run in
my freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is seven year old blue dream hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, I like it cause I have arthritis
in my hands shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I smoke two or three hits of that
specific blue dream, my hands just go
[SPEAKER_01]: stone cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I ever need to do fine work,
like for whatever reason with my hands,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll pull some of that out of the
freezer and take a couple of hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized if I take less than two or
three, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I take more than two or three,
I started to shake even more again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a weird, just getting into
the medical side of things, realize
[SPEAKER_01]: people, there is a magical dose out there
that can be the ideal dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when it, when it comes to shaking
specifically, my father has essential
[SPEAKER_00]: tremor, which is, it's like similar to
Parkinson's, but it's not lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, but it does cause like a shaking of
like everything, like his face will shake
[SPEAKER_00]: his hands and arms will shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the relief that he found early
on was using cannabis and it would lower
[SPEAKER_00]: all of his shaking syndromes down to a
manageable amount, you know, like where
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes in the morning he would pick up
his coffee and like he'd get it to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, like the
coffee's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if he had a little smoke in the
morning, he could have his coffee kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be a little bit more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really amazing to see the
difference between with and without
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a lot of cases, especially
when it comes to something that is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: nerve related, um, you know, disorder of
some kind or just some, some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: general thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine came from arthritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had early onset Parkinson's
because when I moved to Florida and didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to the same quality of,
I moved to California and had better
[SPEAKER_01]: access to the medicinal cannabis selection
that I've never had my entire life prior
[SPEAKER_01]: and didn't realize I had arthritis in both
hands from basketball and football.
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke every finger and I'd also used to
punch walls and anger with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers growing up the youngest of three
getting beat up on like taking out your
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, my hands are beat to shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they shake cause I have osteoarthritis
I have found later in life, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: undiagnosed until like my late twenties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I tried the arthritis stuff,
it just, none of it worked well and it
[SPEAKER_01]: made me feel sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I realized, Oh, certain cannabis
like really helps form cut Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie, smoking that stuff takes my pain
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't reduce the shaking as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces inflammation and it just helps
my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of the best strains for my
particular osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think that, yeah, just always
love highlighting the medical side because
[SPEAKER_01]: whether thankfully it turned out,
I didn't have Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't, um, I think that the
endocannabinoid system is so integrally
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to the human experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least for me, I have a lot of head
injuries and a lot of hand injuries in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it really helped me even
like people think that it hurts your
[SPEAKER_01]: memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I stopped using it or had worse
access to it in Florida, my memory was
[SPEAKER_01]: worse than it had been in the last 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't remember where I parked my
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't remember stuff that I studied
hours for on a test and it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, there's some stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other factors and things like that,
but I had stress and other factors during
[SPEAKER_01]: my undergrad as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to pull it off because I
had access to medicinal cannabis that made
[SPEAKER_01]: my particular system function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I loved like, like I said,
going back to that blue dream,
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that strain so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first one I had to grow and I
loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though people online, Oh,
this looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know what the fuck you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I've been around cannabis grass
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of do know what I'm doing,
but I just, I messed up and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to learn from these mistakes
because my brother and I were just talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about this, but there is, you could read a
dozen books about how to make a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to build a table,
construct it by your hand, you could write
[SPEAKER_01]: a dozen books and you're going to pick up
tips, tricks, helpful tools that will make
[SPEAKER_01]: building a table easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first time you build that table,
you're going to find out there's a tool
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to find out, Oh man,
I, even though it said measure twice,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read that, but I didn't feel the
experience of not doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you just said, okay, it's 24
inches and you cut four 24 inch legs and
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't measure twice and cut once,
you know, like you just cut once and
[SPEAKER_01]: measured once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of those 24 inch legs is
actually 24.25 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got a wobbly ass table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you just learned something from that
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you actually do it, anything,
any hobby or experience in life,
[SPEAKER_01]: the experience is going to teach you as
much as any podcast will, as any book
[SPEAKER_01]: will, or any YouTube video will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the unfortunate reality is
like, I had experience, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: different when I grew indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a commercial fucking house that got
renovated specifically to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were making what now I realize is
millions of dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting fucking basically paid
nothing or trim like gas money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking back, just like, I can't even
believe how much money there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what it was selling for and I knew
how many pounds we're bringing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never actually did the math on
like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, five, six crops a year at this
many pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were making a lot of fucking money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, I never was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always in it for the passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just loved smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it was my, you know,
one of my girlfriends I dated in middle
[SPEAKER_01]: school, her brother would drive to
California in a bus or a van and he'd get
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 pounds at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would always pick up from him right
when he got back because it was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, we knew the guy who did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it was almost like I was just on
the end because I dated that girl and I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't date her because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just happened to find that out after the
fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like an awesome benefactor to
like get access to some of the shit that
[SPEAKER_01]: was better than what we had around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other stuff that came in from Michigan,
just being exposed to good, like even if I
[SPEAKER_01]: only had 20 bucks, I'd rather get like a
gram of good stuff than like a quarter of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, brown pack Mexican, which was
like the option for me at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy's like, I got a quarter for a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: A quarter ounce for $25.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't know if I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, I don't, but you can make
this into five, six blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm not smoking blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking bong balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a difference in thought
process there, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people do just enjoy the smoking
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to smoke joint after joint,
blunt after blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, there's a place I think for
lower potency cannabis, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's like the Bud Lights,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the craft beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seem like for, and I think it
depends on like where you are mentally,
[SPEAKER_00]: like with what you're trying to accomplish
with your smoking, whether it be something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like a social thing where you are
sharing amongst people, but you then kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of want to either keep a little bit of a
more lucid mindset about you so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can converse and talk and, you know,
be social.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like, because sometimes if I smoke
something that's heavy, I am not wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to be social.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to just go curl up in a
corner or go like play some video games or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, because it's just like,
I just need to check out right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: like enjoy my own mental set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, yeah, it's like almost like a time
and place for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, you know, even as you had
said earlier in the podcast, there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different available varieties now
that all have extremely unique effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because everybody's endocannabinoid
system is going to be unique to them as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the mindset going into
smoking, I feel has a heavy effect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: results that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's almost like every single smoking
experience is going to be different for
[SPEAKER_00]: every person with every strain that they
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, with form cut cookies,
finding something that works really well
[SPEAKER_00]: for a specific remedy, pain relief,
mental relief, arthritis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different, like, you know,
getting to have a more freedom of movement
[SPEAKER_00]: with different parts of your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like you said, though, set and
setting, just like, they consider that in
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other, from mushrooms to acid
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll always talk about set and setting
because with a more power, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_01]: more powerful substance, some people think
they'll have maybe a higher respect for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think cannabis is a substance that
alters your mind a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it categorized as a mild
hallucinogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it categorized as a stimulant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's actually a depressant,
but it does make people relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's been documented to
actually drop your heart rate because it
[SPEAKER_01]: typically I think is more of a techie
card.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of goes the other way for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people's heart rate gets increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you feel tired or like pass
out, like your heart rate is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an interesting caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like set and setting on caffeine is
even important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an intention, like you said,
like what you want out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I drank espresso at dinner one night
and I'm not a caffeine person,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I got away with like a single shot of
espresso, knowing like I'm going to just,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is, I was tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be crabby and like not as a
enjoyable of a conversation with like my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that I hadn't seen in a while and
my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, I want to be able to be like
alert and lucid during this conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So had the espresso, was able to enjoy my
dinner, drive home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time like all that was said and
done, I had burnt off whatever energy it
[SPEAKER_01]: had given me, you know, and like I was
able to sleep just fine where sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: like if I'm like, Oh, I need to get a
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I was in college, I'd take a
five hour energy or drink a Red Bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or energy drink or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get the paper done, but then I'd be up
all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, my intention was to get
something done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have like the kind of followup of
like, am I going to be able to sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight after this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was like, I just, all I cared
about was the deadline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having more thoughtfulness to it
and mindfulness in the use is important
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think a lot of people and myself
as well, like can take for granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a powerful tool, you know,
and it's the stuff that I'll use like
[SPEAKER_01]: daily just in the morning to like limit
pain and to help me relax and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's certain things that will be
too strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I could lack, like you're
saying, like if I wanted to go to a social
[SPEAKER_01]: setting, not be able to converse as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I know a lot of people,
even like within a circle, like we'll all
[SPEAKER_01]: be talking, passing around a joint and
like certain people get to a certain spot
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're high where they just clam up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't say anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like silent, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I don't think it's, they're not
trying to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, there's so much going on
in their own head, whether they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: paranoid about not saying something to,
you know, embarrass themselves or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just thinking about other stuff
that's not even happening there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment, or they're just analyzing,
you know, sitting and chilling and
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm a blighter off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll chit chat, but there's
times where certain strains will shut me
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, yeah, very contemplative
and almost meditating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like within there's more than just closing
our eyes and crossing our fingers and our
[SPEAKER_01]: feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think meditation is just
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's movement meditations and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think using cannabis, even like the
breathing, that's why I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people enjoy the bong, like deep breaths
in and deep breaths out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a, almost a meditation in
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, yeah, I agree wholeheartedly with
everything that you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, back, back to the growing
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were growing these giant blue
dreams that completely outgrew your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, by no fault of your own,
you wanted to, to grow your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and, and, and just do that at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had access to the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I've, if I'm, correct me if I'm
wrong, but I believe I heard from you in
[SPEAKER_00]: other shows that the nutrients you were
using were like heavy 16 at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like mixing up all those
different bottles together as a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what got you to, like,
how, how did you like the results of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of what was your mindset around it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when did you transition from that
into a more amended soil-less media?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was using heavy 16 and initially from
the start, I think I just used like the AB
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was a cheap home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the tent, got the light slowly built
out, like got a fan and then realized I
[SPEAKER_01]: needed two, then three, then four,
then however many and built out of edge
[SPEAKER_01]: space eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of did one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: At a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I had the AB and then
like, I was like, oh, what's the next
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to my, and granted he worked for
the hydrostop and he was probably getting
[SPEAKER_01]: a little cut on these sales, but I'd go
over to his place and like check out his
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had all these bottles at his place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what does this one do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's smelling like a lot of their
stuff is like unlicensed organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're, the AB is like a regular
hydro line, but like all of the side
[SPEAKER_01]: additives are like organic kind of inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could really smell it with like
the, I think it was like the prime or the
[SPEAKER_01]: fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was really humicky kind of a,
but all the additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always felt like we're worth it because
I noticed when I would run out of a bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, it didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plants didn't smell or taste as
good or didn't grow as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd always kind of cough up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little expensive admittedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a premier line, but I do think
they did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still actually have cocoa and the whole
nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I ever wanted to like, for whatever
reason, do a side by side, I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the very next grow, I actually found
more success by instead of going in three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a bunch of.
[SPEAKER_01]: One gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually when I had the great white
Buffalo grow, when I grew the sour 76 and
[SPEAKER_01]: I also grew a tester called platinum Yeti.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a platinum headband cross,
but it was like F3, which also got me into
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, what's this whole F2,
F3 kind of generational thing all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that grow went really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had five plants, three sour 76s and two
platinum Yeti.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I had just had two plants in the same
space and I got a shot at my buddy Dave
[SPEAKER_01]: from Ohio, crazy Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, why don't you do like a
sea of green?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually hadn't necessarily seen
that in my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I wasn't like cruising
forums and shit regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't realize because where I was
at in Ohio was so secretive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like don't tell anybody you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding out that there was like a space
online where people are just like posting
[SPEAKER_01]: their grows, asking for advice,
giving advice, getting advice was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked up sea of green cause I didn't
even know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of had more of a sea of green
setup, but it wasn't quite like tiny,
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was doing a bunch of smaller
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, damn dude, you're like
having a ton of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to try that style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did and it worked and they're all
between like one and two feet tall and got
[SPEAKER_01]: between like one and two ounces or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like a crazy, huge harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of went like heavy on like a Schwoz
technique that I saw and I was trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: emulate this grow buckets guy or whatever
the main lining method where you get like
[SPEAKER_01]: eight or like 16 colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you basically take off everything
except for like the main colas or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And immediately the bud turned out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't get a whole lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned, you know, you don't
necessarily have to go that extreme with
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but that was another successful grow
in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I realized was it was taking a
lot of time to pipette out the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: mix them up, pH, do this and that,
and make sure that I was using even like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have pretty clean water where I'm at
and knock on wood because you never know
[SPEAKER_01]: the chicken change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even then I go and get my own personal
water for my wife and I to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't mind lugging five gallon jugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I carry two of them all the time and
I fill them up and I bring them home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's my cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the water that I was using was just
like, you know, you go to the store and
[SPEAKER_01]: you put it under the thing and whatever
you get the clean water with as close to
[SPEAKER_01]: zero PPM as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's filtered a whole bunch of
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was using that and feeling like I
needed to use that for the Heavy 16
[SPEAKER_01]: because when I didn't, I felt like,
again, like you could kind of see like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the plants didn't uptake the
nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, I didn't even know at the time
because I hadn't met Dr. MJ and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even use a PPM meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, feed, feed, water,
feed, feed, water, feed, water,
[SPEAKER_01]: feed, or like give it a compost tea here
and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew that PPM meters and EC meters
existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like that Blue Lab Truncheon,
but when I looked up like the homegrown
[SPEAKER_01]: scale of it, it was like so expensive and
I didn't trust the ones on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, if I'm going to get one,
it's going to be like a Blue Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, man, it's like a hundred bucks
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, fuck, that's like as much
as like my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to spend that kind of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just starting my business at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just moved back here and like,
it's tough to, you know, make a living
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most businesses shutter in like a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's tough to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, to be growing your
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately I realized if you do
produce your own successfully,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cheaper cost per gram by a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially because like my wife and I
were going through at least two ounces a
[SPEAKER_01]: week and two ounces every two weeks,
I think it was so like an ounce a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, if I could grow this and
electrical costs, even at what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably save a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went through and documented
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those first few grows and realized
like, holy shit, like I'm growing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: like X amount of dollars per gram,
like versus if it's 10 a gram to buy it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing it for like one,
two or $3 at the very worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like that was only going down because
like a lot of one-time purchases bought
[SPEAKER_01]: the light, bought the tent, had all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nutrients were a recurring cost or
whatever, but like that was only once
[SPEAKER_01]: every several months or a year,
depending on how much you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did notice that was one of my
bigger costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did not like, as you see,
I do have a cat over here behind me and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a little green screen kind of
situation going on, but just so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: see all the random shit occurring behind
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I realized is it's like, I didn't
like the process of like what felt like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't work in that kind of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't work with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which one of them are
dangerous to me and which one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't dangerous to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I spill it, I know like you're supposed
to, I could read the directions of this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole tiny little print in an emergency
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll admit, I didn't read every single
little warning on the side of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was excited to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd squirt it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would worry if I ever spilled it or
got it on my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd wash real diligently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I know some of that stuff can
actually cause harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want it on or around me
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to say it's like the end of the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: People work with it all the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured if there was a safer and
easier solution out there and I'd already
[SPEAKER_01]: done it kind of in the past with organics,
why not try it inside?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had heard about Subcool,
looked more into his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been smoking his stuff even before I
started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, oh, this dude has like an
Instagram and a YouTube and he just like
[SPEAKER_01]: shows his grows and he has a super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't actually start off with
the super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ended up seeming simpler to me than
doing like the lasagna test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found was I found a bunch of
people in the Michigan community doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: M3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was also a breeder who I thought
at the time was cool and found out later
[SPEAKER_01]: he's a real tea bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to even name them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were claiming really good results
with this M3 Michigan made mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ordered a bag and I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not local.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it's from America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they shipped me a bag of soil or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried it out and sure enough,
it worked damn well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just water only ran it through and I was
like, I did some experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I start in a solo cup and then I
transplant up to a one gallon and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: went up to a three gallon or five gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized like five gallon probably
did a little bit better, but it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: much bigger and managing the water
situation in my small space, like three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons was as big as I wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I ended up with like three,
three gallon pots of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had them all side by side for the
flower tent area, ultimately with that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked and I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately realized that people were
having a lot of success with these earth
[SPEAKER_01]: boxers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing build a soil using the earth
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw Spartan Grown using city pickers
and Cheddar Bob and others using earth
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, like these pots are
all laid right next to each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: like one next to the other, next to the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I could basically just use an
earth box and that would be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I see people use beds so you can
co plant at least two plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got the earth box and kind of
have never looked back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been rocking for the last several
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just got shout out to resurrection
profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just sent me a couple of fresh bags of
M3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to reset because my stuff,
I don't do soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a few years, it's finally gotten
to the point where it still produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It yields well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't taste as good as it did
when I first started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something off in there that I
can't quite figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it probably over amended over
the each grow just gave a little too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little too much, a little too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, it's probably just like
toxically high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to scrap that,
mix it with some like potting soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: garden soil and use that for outdoor
plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe even turn it into like a compost
slash worm bin, depending on my situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my wife is not fond of the worm bin
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy wife, happy life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably just be a outdoor plant
situation, grow some like sunflowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: hollyhocks and other cool stuff outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I love the idea of being able to
use like an amended substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're just reamending it and
getting multiple rounds of harvests out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for a while in like a 30 gallon
grassroots fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was able to pull like seven
harvests out of it with just minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, um, unfortunately I ran into
root aphids and, um, I just scrapped the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil because, uh, well, I, I composted it
so that it, the thermophilic, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, process just annihilated the root
aphids and anything else that was
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, but I, that, and that's like
usually my biggest warning for anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: venturing into something that's going to
be an amended substrate used round after
[SPEAKER_00]: round after round is, uh, fungus gnats,
root aphids, thrips, uh, anything that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be soil born, um, in terms of a
pest, you want to make sure that you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: least having some level of security in
place to make sure that those populations
[SPEAKER_00]: either don't blow up or don't happen or,
um, anywhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but also you, you know, you,
you even mentioned that you have the very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy opportunity of just resetting with a
fresh bag of, of a reputable, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: amended soilless media and going from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've even heard of people
who will use like the kiss organics mix
[SPEAKER_00]: where, um, they just, uh, you know,
they'll only run it three or four times
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they'll reset it because they're
just like, by the time the fifth or sixth
[SPEAKER_00]: gets around, I'm, I'm losing my terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the same cultivars I'm running,
I'm losing the resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield is significantly less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even if everything else has met,
uh, and even if I've seen some people do
[SPEAKER_00]: the saturated pace, pace test and see that
they're at the same levels, they were with
[SPEAKER_00]: the initial substrate, but something's
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, uh, biology or, uh,
it's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much going on in there that
like my stuff still yielding great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't taste as good as it
should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that I'm honest enough to tell
myself like we're smoking some of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: my other buddy's stuff that they grow or
even stuff that like from my wife's work
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'd rather have over home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just never the case before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always harder to have my home grow
over any commercial stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that's not the case anymore,
it's like, well, I gotta admit my stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: not as good as it once was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something wrong with my
process and at least be humble enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: admit, you know, that it probably is the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, I'm doing everything else
the same for the most part and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not too much has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could blame a strain here and there,
but like sometimes it's stuff that I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you said, you've grown it in the past
and it was just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tasted how it's supposed to taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like, when it's not that way
anymore, well time to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: reset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think admittedly, I think if you
even get two runs out of a soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've probably more than gotten your
value out of it because you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: even with cannabis down at like 1000 a
pound, I think is what the average is in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on in the legal market,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the, um, the trim you can get for
like 20, 50, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy low, but, um, it's fascinating
depending on like the quality and like
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor outdoor greenhouse type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but even if just a thousand a pound
being like the reference metric,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess is, um, it's probably lower than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will continue to get lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even if it costs you more to grow it
yourself than it did to, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it, I think it's still worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like the home brewers market,
the craft, you know, beer market,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is, they're going to be a
little bit more expensive and obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that comes higher cost of
production, but it's worth it because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have that passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main thing is there's just no way
to produce what we're able to produce at
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen it done at even the best
of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like when I'm saying scale,
I'm talking like hectares, like several
[SPEAKER_01]: acres scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking like an indoor production
or a hundred lights or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: even a thousand lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, you could do semi craft level
or high quality cannabis and those a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand lights and under depending on how
big your team is and how good your team
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start getting to acres and
acres of so much area under glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the quality that I can produce in
my little and going back to like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's funny because in my head I saw like
when I started, like what I thought was
[SPEAKER_01]: the best, it was like a whole,
if, if you could dream as a cannabis car,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you dedicate a whole house to it,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just spare no cost on expense and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I just saw a report and this
don't come at me for racial stuff people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this was documented in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99% of indoor cannabis cultivation is done
by Chinese individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we were doing it just how they do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, as you see all these grow houses
rated and it's like basically like an
[SPEAKER_01]: indentured servitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these people owe people money and
they get sent over here and they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow weed to pay off their debts type
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like sleeping in a sleeping
bag and like the rest of the house is
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you would think maybe in your head
like, Oh, that's the ideal setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the most room for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all the equipment, all set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible for that grower to tend to
each one of those plants as well as he
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many plants, even if you
double, tripled, quadrupled the growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: like even at a commercial scale,
like when there's thousands of plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of plants, the individual
attention to each plant is dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, your personal choice
is less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you go out to the market,
there might be 50, a hundred, 200 trains
[SPEAKER_01]: available, thousands trains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go to every single dispenser in
California and find a thousand or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 10,000 or more strains on the seed
market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go and find whatever strain you
want across to whatever strain you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't, you can probably find
the cuts and make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, if you can't, you can probably
find somebody else who did something close
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like one of the parents is
different, but even like, if you can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% something and across, if you,
if you know, hunt through that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to find something like that
clone or cut or bag that you smoked that
[SPEAKER_01]: you liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, that was how I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had tons of, tons of success
finding exactly what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, popping a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't move onto the next breeder,
do your research, obviously, because a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of them are con artists and fly by night,
they're going to be gone tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing knockoff work a lot of
the time, but even if they're still
[SPEAKER_01]: around, like some of the big ones are some
of the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be aware of that, but do research on
like who did the original?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like part of the reason I did 50 strains
of green was to basically highlight good
[SPEAKER_01]: old school breeders who did a lot of that
work to make things like we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: at the top of the show, kind of close to
bulletproof or like really stable where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to see a firm just
because it got a little hot or a little
[SPEAKER_01]: dry or a little overwater, a little
underwater, like one or two times isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to cause it to just go, you know,
where some stuff, the first issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just bananas everywhere or Chuck and
Paul, if it's a early male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a quick sidebar, do you mind
just briefly touching on your,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, your work as an author and,
and publishing your own book?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been an interesting process for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I recently read or I'm reading a book
from a self published author that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the 1970s, uh, Tom Kelly's 10th
Legion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's a really interesting book,
but reading the back, it, it said I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: self published author because that meant
like, I don't know if he said like stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: enough or crazy enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in my car right now actively reading
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, he said all that basically met
was like, you found a publishing house
[SPEAKER_01]: that was willing to charge you to like
print your own stuff essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and that's kind of what happened
with my situation is, uh, I wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had heard about like the Canna Bible and
I've seen an own, you know, a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: these books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Subcool's The Dank is one that I
really like and The Dank 2.0 where he
[SPEAKER_01]: documents his strains with photos,
a description and, you know, the story
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love those books so much,
but like there's only so many of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not really making a whole bunch of
new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them were like the Canna
Bible for example, it was just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of, you know, maybe like the top
strains of that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it didn't have like a real
specific focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I grew up in liking like dog
breeds and there was so much, if you look
[SPEAKER_01]: into like American Kennel Club,
if you want to learn about any one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those dog breeds, there's so much you can
learn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how long the tail is, how long the
ears are, the temperament, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you are into the hobby,
you have not endless, but like tons and
[SPEAKER_01]: tons, maybe it is endless because they
keep making new library though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's a lot of deep details and
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like with cannabis, I felt like
seedfinder.eu is probably like one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: closest things we had to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go and find, and it's like
Wikipedia more than it is the American
[SPEAKER_01]: Kennel Club because anybody can put
anything on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, Oh, I made this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to become, you know,
inspector gadget over here and try and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out 53 entries for OG Kush and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like who actually made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, so I was like, this is so
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I get a hundred questions a day
asking me, not actually a hundred,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like for a while, like we,
I'd get hundreds per week of people asking
[SPEAKER_01]: me certain questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the recurring ones are,
what is the strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who made this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times I'd be listening to
shows and I still do like, I'll be in the
[SPEAKER_01]: chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they'll be like, what is the strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just be like, it's X cross to Y,
you know, like I'll tell them it's OG Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: cross to, you know, cookies or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started sort of like Matthew
Gay Gates, whenever there would be
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody post the image of a plant with
bugs on it, everyone would just tag at
[SPEAKER_01]: sync angel on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd see like a few hours later,
sync angel would come in and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a tetranite ear decay or spider
mites or whatever, you know, like you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: give like the Latin name, the real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, here's what you use to
treat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's my, you know, there's a link on
my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go watch my pest primer on
YouTube and like, it'll show you all the
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that you can fight it and like
everything about like how they live and
[SPEAKER_01]: the reproductive cycles and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came to know him by seeing him
basically demonstrating his
[SPEAKER_01]: professionalism by helping people for free
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of be that person in a little
bit of way, cause I'm just a nerd for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried a bunch of them myself,
and I'm always wanting to learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't I get into that space a
little bit more and make something
[SPEAKER_01]: concrete.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Instagram can be deleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: My stuff can be shadow banned,
but a paperback or a book that sits on
[SPEAKER_01]: your desk or on your countertop where you
smoke, nobody can censor that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can delete that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might be burnt up in a fire or
something, but I'll send you another copy
[SPEAKER_01]: if anything like that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by making something concrete,
forums get deleted or lost and one gets
[SPEAKER_01]: popular and then it fades out of,
you know, popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next one gets popular and it
fades out of popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we lose so much of our history.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense, I felt almost in retrospect,
like an ethnobotanist in a way,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm covering people and culture as
much as I'm covering the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's a major part of what this
industry is and what this plant took to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive, you know, through thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was cultural reasons and,
you know, even business reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure back times before we even had
documentation, I'm sure people were
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it or exchanging it for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or other goods, foods and services and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very historically, you know,
significant plant and so little modern
[SPEAKER_01]: research has been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting better in recent years,
but so much of it for a long time was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, how is this addictive or how is it
problematic and bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does it cause crime or what crimes
are related to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're like, what does it do
medically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how does it do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it helping all these people with
sleep, pain, anxiety, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mental illness, so many other ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's considered quote dirty drug
because it treats more than one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a clean drug is like, oh,
this is a pain reliever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does pain relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a boner pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you boners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it does one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was initially supposed to be a heart
drug and they found out it became an
[SPEAKER_01]: erection medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got a very specific target now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bunch of different knockoffs
of that now or different styles from gels
[SPEAKER_01]: to mists to tabs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with cannabis, it's kind of interesting
because it treats so many different things
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the different strains like certain
ones are better for different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted with 50 strains of green
to as much as I could document my own
[SPEAKER_01]: personal experiences with what I felt were
50 of the best strains that grew green and
[SPEAKER_01]: finished green because I'd seen in
California a lot of like OGs talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: when the purple came in, a lot of the OGs
just threw all their old cuts out and took
[SPEAKER_01]: the purple because that's all people were
buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we lost a lot of history there when
purple got popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, I need to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a lot of these green strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in my personal experience,
some of the best effects came from the
[SPEAKER_01]: green strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's not just California.
[SPEAKER_01]: California often leads the market,
but a lot of other markets kind of feel
[SPEAKER_01]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like purple is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first strain that I put out a bunch is
a purple strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted it to be purple because so
many people have never experienced that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people still haven't had access
to good purple bud or any purple bud to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow that yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like seeing it go from green and veg to
purple, it's like a fucking magic trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it turned pink or red,
like it changed in colors when it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: green its whole life, other than turning
like yellow or something or brown,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it would be, it's such a beautiful
experience, but with as much as purple is
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost some of the passion for green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, what are my top 15?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tried over a thousand at this
point and I documented hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a little journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it make me feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did I use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did I use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Set and setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got this a couple of them like had,
they're like cannabis specific journals
[SPEAKER_01]: that have like pre cut out things for you
to fill in like one through 10 or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uplifting, sedating,
like smells, flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it linger?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it like hit you immediately?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like all these different little subtle
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was able to back reference those
as I wrote the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I realized at the same time,
like you mentioned earlier in the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: my experience isn't everyone's experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cross-reference my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cross-reference my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cross-reference the internet,
Leafly and all these other websites and
[SPEAKER_01]: see how does my experience stack up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to include a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes my experience is the common
eight out of 10, nine out of 10 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an uplifting strain, I get that
uplifting effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'm the one out of 10 outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like that Mac one that everybody
loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried Capuletors Mac one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't like it from the horse's mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got it directly from the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, that's so unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's profile does not work with my
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like how it smells,
how it tastes, how it makes them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's very best it's ever been
to me was a seven out of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm being generous,
like probably more like a 6.5 for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so like how you talk about the form
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Mac one was the first thing that I
experienced where I had, um, like what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would call like a true medicinal reaction
to it where like pain that I was feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: went away almost instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it is, it was astonishing for me
how well it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, even that alone right there
shows any of the listeners, how unique an
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system can be and how
unique a terpene and cannabinoid profile
[SPEAKER_00]: of a flower or a concentrate can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just that, but like you said,
you got it from the guy who bred it and
[SPEAKER_00]: grows it now in the commercial market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it from someone who was not that
person in a completely different state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so who even knows if the growing
styles were similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only say that because I tried it 15
times before that wasn't his.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, Oh, I just had a good
representation where I haven't grown it
[SPEAKER_01]: myself yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if I haven't grown it myself yet,
I don't necessarily think I've given it a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't grown Mac one to say,
um, for myself, but I haven't grown it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I didn't like any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got it from him and I didn't
like it, that was really sealed the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it from a guy who said they got it
from him and then I got it from him
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, uh, but it is cool that I
will say this, I don't want people to get
[SPEAKER_01]: tribal about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cap's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a lot of his other crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he runs a good forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that he maybe sells good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried it, but, um, I've heard
good things about some of his microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even IPM products and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think happy later school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him shook his hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was super nice to me, but flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we had a good, good
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, um, you know, I literally only
got the Mac one just to say that I got
[SPEAKER_01]: some from him to try it from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I'm happy that it works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are like, Oh, like Jack
doesn't like the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he thinks that Mac one sucks and no one
should use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, that's not what I'm trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually trying to say like the
opposite, like just cause I like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I cross reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if I would have just said 50 strains
of Jack's favorite, then I think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: limited book, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, maybe I just like more sativa
than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like my wife didn't start smoking
sativa until like a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I use sativa very more
uplifting, uh, heady highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like those, you know, especially
daytime and midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't like them for a long,
long, long time until she started working
[SPEAKER_01]: with certain brands that had maybe more
what I would call like a closer to the
[SPEAKER_01]: heirloom or, or even, um, some land race
type varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And funny enough, she actually enjoyed
those more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's something of a balance
in there and some of the more modern,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call sativa uplifting crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder how much of it could have
also just been with, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like with most other systems within the
body, nervous circulatory endocannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: they develop and change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the receptors can become blocked or
open up or, um, even yeah, through set and
[SPEAKER_00]: setting as you get older and as,
as your, uh, you know, your hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormonal structure changes and the
rest of your body changes over time and
[SPEAKER_00]: your mental state changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things could provide just a
different experience of the same product
[SPEAKER_00]: from one year to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some people will get paranoid
now that can't even use it anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they used to love taking big bong
hits and like, they can't even smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I do think that's a major factor
to how people are going to experience it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, I want to rein this back
in just a little bit actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, get back to a little bit more of
the growing questions since we are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the two hour mark here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just make sure that I get as
much of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we run over just a little bit,
um, but throughout all of your experience
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, uh, you know, from all the way
back to your first experience where you
[SPEAKER_00]: were helping, uh, to now where you have
multiple years of home grow experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, changing from hydroponics to,
uh, organics or amended substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what, uh, and I'm, I'm going to pose
this as a two part question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have been some of your biggest
learning experiences and a, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a setback, something that really made
you feel like, uh, like you could call it
[SPEAKER_00]: a failure in the garden or, um,
something that you didn't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: occur again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other side of the coin,
um, what have you learned the most from a
[SPEAKER_00]: success that you found in your garden
where, uh, you then took that practice and
[SPEAKER_00]: either, uh, continued to perfect it or
just took it as it was and made sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were implementing that every time
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start with the success first and
then finish with the failure because,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we recently did an episode where we
talked a lot about learning from failures
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, growing with my fellow growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do encourage people to check it out,
uh, growing with my fellow growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do host on Sundays on the YouTube and we
did a whole, uh, I think it was just two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ago about new year, just learning
from failures and a whole bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the success, one thing that you
brought up in just now, you asked the
[SPEAKER_01]: question, maybe think specifically of,
um, using the drought stress to benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: your terpene expression, to benefit the
resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to Hash Church for a long time
and Bubbleman and others mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender grown in France had the highest
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sold for the highest dollar per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the most linalool production,
which is a terpene found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, well, if linalool is
increased by being grown in this
[SPEAKER_01]: Mediterranean region and they are known
for getting a drought late season,
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe we can give our plants a late
season drought, just like late in flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of weeks before we harvest them,
let them get real dry, dry the pots all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way back until they get droopy and did
it once accidentally, just cause my pots
[SPEAKER_01]: were a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what really made me start
believing it and push and doing it every
[SPEAKER_01]: single harvest because it was actually
that sour 76 and platinum yeti grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they were in one gallon cocoa pots,
which if you know about growing in one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon cocoa pots, especially in like
Southern California, where it can get dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have good airflow, um,
those pots can dry out within like a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So late in flower, you got big,
you know, two foot tall plant and next to
[SPEAKER_01]: like a one and a half foot tall plant,
that two foot tall plant might drink a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had two platinum yetis.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, they were both really sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just de-leafed the resin was really
sandy and it felt like grainy almost
[SPEAKER_01]: literally like grains of sand on the,
on top of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that got drought stressed the next
day felt like super glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so sticky and it was pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much louder and just the smell
was screaming off that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could like, when you'd stick your
fingers together, they would like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like the glue trace after you just
touch one leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so significantly different than
the day before that I just let the one
[SPEAKER_01]: next to it drought as well to see like,
is it maybe just the stage of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're at the same day, a flower,
this one's so much stickier than that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just droughted and the one next to
it was still sandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just let it go dry, dry, dry,
dry, dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as it dried down, watered it
again, came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super glue sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that to the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other plant this hour 76 is they all
got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that point forward, I was like,
all right, week seven drought stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause I think that's what it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned this on the podcast a few
times and then it turns out there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: university of Guelph in Canada study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guelph is G-U-E-L-P-H.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Canadian pronunciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have Canadian listeners out
there who product, I used to call it gelf,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's Guelph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the Canadians who listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all the, it's humbling,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I just, I'm sitting here in
my room on a podcast, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people all over the world
actually listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is honestly mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like a Midwestern dude, like talking
about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the biggest success that I
learned from the Guelph study ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: showing a week eight drought stress
increased the terpene cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: production and the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield was even higher than like their
well watered condition, which doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: the water came from a well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was watered well or properly,
which meant they did a bunch of studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out how to water as good as they
could, did the good as they could method,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then tried that against the drought
stress method.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drought stress method outperformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody wants, I could send them
that link, or you could just look up a
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone management, Guelph drought,
cannabis study, and it'll pop up on Google
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also suggest to anybody that wants
to look up drought stressing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits in a hydroponic setting,
as well as even in organic settings to
[SPEAKER_00]: look up how commercial tomatoes are
cultivated, especially vining tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they go through in like crop
steering, you would call it generative
[SPEAKER_00]: versus vegetative steering events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generative being that drought stress
or other stress events and vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: being reduced stress events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have these cycles of stress,
low stress, stress, low stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can produce rapid onset of the
fruit sets for tomatoes and have it
[SPEAKER_00]: produce and ripen and create new tomatoes
all at once so that you're having this
[SPEAKER_00]: constant cycle of harvesting every,
I think it's nine days or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, typically within a vining tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so taking those same practices and
applying them to cannabis has shown in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cases that it's very much a benefit
to the plant overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not the first person that says that
they, you know, because they saw cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as their baby, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to hurt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to make sure it was happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to make sure that they did
everything they could for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they missed something or they
caused some stress event and it opened up
[SPEAKER_00]: their mind to being like, holy crap,
this plant responds in a positive way to
[SPEAKER_00]: these stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I replicate this consistently
without it being something that is a true
[SPEAKER_00]: detriment to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the times I'll refer to it
as a perceived stress because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like a true stress event where it's going
to cause degradation in the plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: or in its growth processes or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something where it's like,
oh, it thinks it doesn't have water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it actually still does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get it water and,
you know, really soon here anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just let it, let it go, do the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then boom, you got terpenes that are
louder than you thought they could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin production that's off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's distress versus eustress because
distress is bad and eustress is positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it was statistically shown
that it was a eustress, that late flower
[SPEAKER_01]: drought stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also add, I personally feel that
there's not a negative side effect and
[SPEAKER_01]: there could also be a positive side
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in a week seven or week eight,
depending on how long you're two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: before you harvest ideally, but week seven
or eight, one drought stress throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: your whole flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second one I would add on top of
that, that I don't have data to support
[SPEAKER_01]: this, but I like a drought stress up
through harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right before you harvest, letting your
media dry out and even letting the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of suffer a little bit on the low
water end, I can't verify a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, but I do think just like that
week seven and eight pushes out a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even somebody just asked me this
today in the DM, what do I feel about the
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness before harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will let the, you know,
say harvest right before the lights come
[SPEAKER_01]: on 12 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that at the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like to do at least 24 hours myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll double that dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're used to being 12 on 12 off
or 11 13, whatever it is, I'll give them
[SPEAKER_01]: their last light cycle and then I'll go
dark for 24 hours from then at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't push.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll do 24 to 48, usually just
on the convenience of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I can get to it, to be honest
after 24, though, I like 24 up to 48.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think after 48 being in darkness that
long, uh, sometimes moisture can creep up
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't want to like risk any molds
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you can mitigate it really well
with climate control, then you can maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: get away with a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that there's a major benefit
from 48 versus 72.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as long as you get that full 24
darkness, the plants like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights were supposed to come back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what the fuck's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what is happening?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, maybe I can put out
something to attract something to
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but they tend to, uh,
in my experience seem to really perform at
[SPEAKER_01]: their best if you give them just that
little extra nods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, for sure in terms of mistakes
that I learned from definitely going into
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got moisture meters now, so I don't do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then I'll still find a bud here
and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, uh, you know, I do like it sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to err on the side of,
um, a little bit damper than some.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I, if I wanted to, I could get my stuff
into jars bone dry, but, um, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a window between like bone dry to
powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which like a lot of stuff you get the
dispensary turns out to be and like that
[SPEAKER_01]: nice sticky sponginess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to get it in that sticky spongy
range, but even a little bit under that is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably I've, I don't know if it was,
um, PM or a bud rot or whatever it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just like a spider webby nasty,
uh, portrait is I think maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, within the jars after I harvested some
of the biggest let downs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, like I said, I was like one nug,
but it was always the fattest Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I lost a seven gram Cola on one
and 11 gram Cola on another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, since then probably like three or
four gram Coles were like the most recent
[SPEAKER_01]: in the last few years that I lost,
but, um, I ended up not typically keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar or I'll just turn that jar into
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even like the stuff that didn't have mold
on it, just, uh, if I don't straight up
[SPEAKER_01]: toss it all, I'll turn into like a oil or
something that I ended up using to cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, I feel like it's fairly
safe, but had issues with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, so that's the same answer that
Spartan gave actually about the going into
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar too wet being his biggest setback
that he learned from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I, I feel like I could say
that that was definitely one point where I
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to get into jars too wet,
um, because I wanted to allow for the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymatic processes to continue in the
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think I just was looking about
it as, as though these enzymes really
[SPEAKER_00]: needed a lot more moisture than they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's more moisture than you can
feel without a meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my stuff feels crispy bone dry on the
outside and I stick that meter in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's still like eight, 10,
12, 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when you look at it 12 hours or 24
hours after it goes in the jar,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot, oftentimes it off gases that stuff
on the inside that you can't even see the
[SPEAKER_01]: crispy little leaves on the outside are
really deceptive because they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could flake them off with a little
tap, but the inside of the bud is still
[SPEAKER_01]: really, um, pretty damp still.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people, um, that they know
that they dried and cured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you grind it up and you pour it
out and it looks like kinetic sand where
[SPEAKER_00]: it keeps moving after you've poured it out
onto your rolling tray or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it, it rolls up so nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can like, I feel like you can take
someone who's had trouble rolling joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them flour that looks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden they'll be like,
man, I'm really good at rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I basically pack like once you roll it
one time, it keeps its shape and then
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to burn even in like a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like a little scooper and like if
it's at the texture, I actually like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't fall into the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make like a lump and I have to like
scrape it over and off and tap it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it, otherwise it's just like, it sticks to
itself too much or like, I'll have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: my finger and kind of like feather it in
off of this little, it's a little bent
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of cardboard or whatever,
just like a, a scoop and dump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, it's covered in resin or
whatever, but it's just an easier way to
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily, I don't have long
fingernails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always keep mine trimmed low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to pick stuff up off the
rolling tray and get it into the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I know they make little tools and
things like that, but this is simple and
[SPEAKER_01]: it works.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those are great answers for,
um, setbacks and successes that have
[SPEAKER_00]: helped you kind of shape your grow and,
and, uh, um, practices that you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: follow to today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Setback is just overwatering since Spartan
had the same answer as me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in terms of seedlings, especially I
killed off a couple of seedlings in my
[SPEAKER_01]: early growing by giving them a little too
much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even now, like mature plants,
I'd rather air on the side of
[SPEAKER_01]: underwatering than overwatering because
like, as we talked about in the successes,
[SPEAKER_01]: a drought stress, especially like in late
flower can actually have a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, the one caveat I do want to
give is, um, the Guelph university did the
[SPEAKER_01]: same study with like multiple drought
stresses throughout flower earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: like weeks two, three, four, five,
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they had more than one before week
seven or week eight, then it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased yield, decreased terpene
production, decreased cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're just like, Oh, Jack said that
you can get away with like all these
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses and like, he loves drought
stressing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be careful with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it when it's supposed to happen late in
the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it would in nature in that area where
the best stuff comes from, or in a
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environment, like we're trying
to do with a horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can control that kind of stuff and get
the desired results.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're just doing it every time,
that's like airing into the side of being
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a lazy lazy gardener, but more
people are more on gardeners where we just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to give more and more and more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was that person and it tend to still
lean on that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to say like, is it ready for
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll like lift the pot and like,
can it wait another day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it starting to droop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like sometimes I'll push them a
little bit too much in the veg side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things and I'll slow things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, it's always a process to kind of
tinker with and dial in and take time and
[SPEAKER_01]: put it on your calendar, figure out like
this veg was 30 days, this veg was 36,
[SPEAKER_01]: this one was 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I do on the 30 day veg to make it
30 days and try and replicate that and try
[SPEAKER_01]: and cut it down to 25, 20, 21,
however fast you can get it to get a big
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy plant ready flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just like, to always add the caveat
as well to, you know, anybody that is
[SPEAKER_00]: attempting to do like a drought stress or
something that it matters what substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using and it matters the frequency
between your dry backs because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate sizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these different things need to
be taken into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of cases, it's going to take
multiple rounds for you to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: is working, what doesn't work and the best
practices involved in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just kind of adding,
don't just start drought stressing your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants all over the place throughout all
of flower cause more is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so great, great caveat that you added
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does, it's very important,
especially I feel like we do have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: new growers that listen to the show and
especially with the cheap home grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has a lot of new growers that
are looking to glean some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I learned a lot from you guys early
on when I was getting back into growing
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, after the COVID shutdown and
when being in restaurants was no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: very tenable for at least, you know,
two or three years there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recent dark ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you had your setback,
your success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you feel that when
new growers or growers in general are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at cultivating, is there something
that you ever like to put your finger on
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, this is probably the most
important thing you need to pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to as you're getting into this,
you know, because there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different styles of growing, whether it be
salt based fertilizers or an amended
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, whether you're using high
intensity discharge lighting, LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, sunlight, you know, there's so
many different parameters that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: unique to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we've repeated this over
and over again in this podcast so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had to put your finger on one,
is there any that you could and if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not just one, like maybe just a couple?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy for me because I think all of
the things that you just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll change how the plant expresses
itself and some things work better for
[SPEAKER_01]: other people and some things are better
suited for certain environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: HID, for example, if you're in the great
white north and it's freezing cold all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time in Canada where you're at,
and you want a little bit of extra heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some people get away with running
HIDs and no other Egro as up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, I think, and he grows with
HIDs and still kills it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people with the most modern
LEDs, Spartan grown out there with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Grandmaster or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you could get the brand newest
and coolest and you can get the oldest and
[SPEAKER_01]: most classic and they'll all still work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I think ultimately makes the
biggest difference above all is the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be, you know, a little bit
generic thing to say, but you could take a
[SPEAKER_01]: great grower and give them terrible
genetics and say, pick whatever equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to have a hard time
growing some dank, but you could take a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand new grower with entry level,
whatever kit, you know, not even all the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a good cut or a good pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to grow some fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So genetics is like, you can dial in the
environment slowly over time and good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics will do okay to good even in bad
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having good genetics is one of
the most under researched things because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I talked about why I got into writing
50 strains of green is like Google good
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want good cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I'm going to get sent to,
you know, some giant generic white
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling seed bank that says that they
have all these strands that we just talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got GG for, they've got OG Kush,
they've got Girl Scout cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got Mac one and it's labeled that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would think, well, they're selling
it as that just like anything else in
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go online and I buy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have some sort of belief that
what they're selling is real and I'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds in the mail and I can grow them out
and maybe it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they won't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take the time, even just like
15 minutes of research to try and go and
[SPEAKER_01]: like say who was the original creator of
whatever strain and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: like 20 different articles and you start
reading through the first 10 and eight out
[SPEAKER_01]: of 10 of them say the same person.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the one person who actually did
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's a bunch of people trying
to like claim that they're the original
[SPEAKER_01]: and they might be dead or they might not
be selling that seed anymore or that seed
[SPEAKER_01]: might not be available in a pure form
because it's like they're closely held cut
[SPEAKER_01]: and a special thing to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy to be like, well,
if I can't just get the purple punch,
[SPEAKER_01]: then like why even grow any seeds that are
not the pure thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want something called purple punch
because I want purple punch because purple
[SPEAKER_01]: punch sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go and buy purple punch from Barney's
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney's farm didn't make purple punch and
so they're going to get some seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows if they even have purple punch
in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some stuff from Barney's farm is good,
but like their tangerine dream is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a vanilla Kush that like the
Mendo Dope boys use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're featured in 50 strains of green
for their tangerine Kush because it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: high and a few different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty confident that that is one
that is from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find anywhere else that
tangerine dream came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and same with the vanilla Kush,
like the vanilla Kush definitely came from
[SPEAKER_01]: Barney's for Mendo Dopes crosses that they
use any vanilla stuff or for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though I don't like that
breeder because they have poor ethics,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and they pushed like Breeder
Steve, one of the OGs out of the space for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully he's back Stars and Stripes
seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually made a Instagram account
because I got so many people asking me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, who should I follow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who should I get seeds from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's so many out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, there's 10,000 strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, I could figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made an account called aromatic dot
Akines, which is A-C-H-E-N-E-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Akines is just like a seed and Tau had
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's the American one with Akines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, I Googled what that was and
I was like, okay, cool seeds, aromatic
[SPEAKER_01]: Akines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was figured if I ever like gotten
to breeding or whatever, I could maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: make that my breeder name or something
like my brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I ended up more so using it to just
follow breeders that I believe that are
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read off a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A-K-Bean Brains, the real Crockett 420,
Lemon Hoco Genetics, American one with
[SPEAKER_01]: Akines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Stay Fly Farms, who's also known
as Original Dengster, O-H-Original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lone Star Larf is on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Airy Genetics, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Lone Star Larf actually
breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've just accidentally followed him
because he's a homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo Dope Boys is on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They breed Jinx Proof, Alien Genetics,
Humboldt Seed Organization, HSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Green Source Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Ludlow Seeds, which I think is
Tau's, like how I have this aromatic
[SPEAKER_01]: Akines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he ever turned Ludlow
Seeds into his actual thing or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm pretty sure he didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real Cali Connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people like to hate on Cali
Connection, but they've grown some,
[SPEAKER_01]: bred some really fire stuff, including the
Deadhead OG, featured in 50 Strains of
[SPEAKER_01]: Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that string.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk House Genetics, Crater of the Donnie
Burger, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second Generation Genetics, that's DJ
Short's son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt Seed Company and Nat Pennington,
he's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to meet him and his daughter at one
of the conventions here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spire Ridge Farms, they're a smaller
boutique one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to carry some of their stuff in my
delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sin City Seeds, Relentless Genetics,
Bloom Seed Co., JBC Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a seed bank, not a breeder,
but Freeborn Selections, that's Mean Gene
[SPEAKER_01]: from Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old World Genetics is DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice Seed Bank is Shanti Baba,
Green Bodhi, and then Mr. Soul,
[SPEAKER_01]: C99, Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA Genetics, they've got some pretty fire
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that some people don't like them in
Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supernova Gardens, Exotic Genetics,
Symbiotic Genetics, and Subcool Seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then Master Flex One, which is the
Crater of the Donnie Burger, but he also
[SPEAKER_01]: goes by Skunk House Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole list of the 40 people,
and you can go and check out any of their
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagrams, find them on different seed
banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow seeds from them and you don't
like them, I'd be very surprised,
[SPEAKER_01]: because all those people that I listed,
they've been doing it for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they work with some of the best,
if not the best stuff, and I'm picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell people straight up, like,
your stuff's not good, or I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that it's not good,
but I do think that I have a fairly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be a little bit objective in
terms of there are certain qualities,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it smells, if there's a certain amount
of smell, even if it's not a smell that I
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of how GMO smells,
but I know what it's supposed to smell
[SPEAKER_01]: like, and if it's present or not present,
that'll dictate how good the grade is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of commercial GMOs cut way too
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe harvested for hash, and terpenes are
added back in, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference between that and like
a flower that's supposed to be grown 77,
[SPEAKER_01]: 78, 80 days, that gets taken at 60,
or 62, or 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think genetics is one of those things
that people really need to pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to, because there are so many other
variables within the grow, but good
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics are kind of a constant,
where if you have something that is stable
[SPEAKER_00]: and grows well and works for your
environment or for your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system, whether, you know, kind of
depending on how you're going about why
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like genetics need to be at
the top of your list in terms of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for to make sure that the
grow goes off without too many hitches,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even your list of 40, you know,
I feel like there's just so many more that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be added to that list, and there's
just so many ... Those are just the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've vetted personally and can
guarantee, because I know that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I would like to add to that
list, because I see the stuff that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, and it looks really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I also see, like, that person
hermed out six people's gardens,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now all six of those people,
five out of six of those people are no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer even growing cannabis, because it
shut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like ... And I guess it depends
on the application, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have the ability to phenohunt,
then, you know, like maybe going through
[SPEAKER_00]: someone like Caleb at CSI Humboldt,
where you get to just pop a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: S1s of literally whatever strain you can
think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably has an S1 of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I didn't list him, he should be on that
list, because either his account got
[SPEAKER_01]: deleted, or he's definitely one that I
should have on there that maybe isn't on
[SPEAKER_01]: there, because I grow CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love his stuff, and I think he does
great work, so I would definitely agree
[SPEAKER_00]: wholeheartedly with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of like for hash and
stuff, I always ... Like if people can
[SPEAKER_00]: find it, I always tell them to look for
Oni seeds, because like so much of his
[SPEAKER_00]: work is so stable and so prolific in other
people's breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, shoot, I use a military chocolate
for breeding when I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's people, you know,
that have made their entire careers off of
[SPEAKER_00]: a cut of seeds that they found.
Do you know about Oni and Bloom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Oni and Bloom Seed Co., because I
know ... I think Bloom Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of Oni's original ... Like I think
they used to be partners, and maybe that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Oni stopped selling seeds for
a while, because he wanted to just put all
[SPEAKER_00]: of his seed stock into production at a
recreational facility that he helped open
[SPEAKER_00]: in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to look more into that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in San Diego, so I need to look into
the whole Oni thing, because when I
[SPEAKER_01]: initially looked into it, I thought Bloom
was kind of the direction that they went
[SPEAKER_01]: with the more modern, and I think it was
either a friend or, you know, co-breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Masonic is another one who
works with a lot of like Oni's ... Like
[SPEAKER_01]: his Wilson, I think, came from ... The
Wilson Zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's ...
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely am a fan of what I've seen
come out of Oni, but like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just generically included Bloom,
because that's where I saw ... A lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the hash makers, even now still today,
will say, same thing about Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to make any hash,
Bloom Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: is ... They're specifically breeding
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably add another one,
Farmhouse, but I haven't grown any other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but Farmhouse PDX, they do ...
Schwal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Schwal, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their photography is insane, and the stuff
that they're breeding looks incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just haven't gotten around to trying it
and don't know anybody who has yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that's got me reticent to include
it, because it's like a lot of stuff looks
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really good, and then I try some
of it, and it's like not as good as I was
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting or ... But if I hear enough good
opinions, I think that might be more open
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know ... I like to know
somebody personally that I've talked to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot that has been like, I grew this,
and it was top 10, top 5.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're basically giving it your
stamp of approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be pretty ...
[SPEAKER_00]: assured that you're not giving that to
someone that either doesn't deserve it or
[SPEAKER_00]: that may fall short of the expectations
that people that want to listen to you are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vetting is very important, and it's great
to have people like you out there that are
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in time and effort into reviewing
these different strains and putting in as
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate and holistic of information out
there as possible for people to use when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're starting up their new grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a valiant effort, and I'm sure it
takes a lot of time and effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it may not be the most ... You may
not suffer while doing it, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you get to try all these different
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The discovery is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of listening to podcasts
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of trying different stuff
out myself and talking to people who've
[SPEAKER_01]: tried the same stuff or similar things
from those breeders and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: conglomerating it all into one massive
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 strands of green came together a lot
faster than purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave less than 50 breeders in my little
list or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably about 50, but I think to
be in the top 50 of anything in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing pretty dang good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top 10 or whatever is unbelievable,
and to be the best, you really have to
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicate your whole entire life,
I think, in most cases, to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get dumb luck sometimes,
but a lot of people are really working
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard, and those people I can
guarantee are going to provide solid
[SPEAKER_01]: product, customer service, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 strands of purple is finished,
actually, now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just getting with my formatter who's
getting a new computer or something in
[SPEAKER_01]: February, so the pre-order will be going
live for that soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been two, three years in the
making.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to get more strains initially
than I did for green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my top 50 pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to narrow it down to that 50,
and it almost never changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe added one or subtracted one,
but 50 strands of purple, I started with
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 or 75 and have narrowed that down to
50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I got to 50, I dropped a couple
because I was like, this isn't as good as
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little worried because I have a
couple related, a few different runts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm like, well, should I just put this
all under one runt?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I took the gelato approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all just one gelato, and I described
the different cuts of gelato in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the runts cuts were so different from
one another that I describe a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different ones because their tastes or
their impact medicinally were so much
[SPEAKER_01]: different from the next runts that I was
like, this is a whole different strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm not just going to include it in the
same thing because it has the same name or
[SPEAKER_01]: some similar shared genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like trying to describe all
OGs as one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's such vast differences from like an
OG Kush to a Tahoe OG or a White Tahoe
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies even where it is like an OG
Leaning Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asphalt OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the runts, I feel like it was like
the dawn of the candy gas era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that, I feel like candy gas is a
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have stuff that's more leaning towards
that gassy, fuely, burn-your-nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: even rubbery at times, all the way to this
like pungent, sickly, sweet candy that
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're standing in the middle of a
candy store on a hot day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anywhere in between, and so it would
be really hard to describe those all as
[SPEAKER_00]: one, especially considering the different
cannabinoid profiles that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find across that spectrum as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you're taking so much
effort and painstaking time into making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that this accurately represents what
is kind of the current wave of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout not only the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational and legal market,
but the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants candy and everyone wants
gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the origins of those purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a lot of people don't agree on
where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't agree on what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say maybe even before runs,
the dawn of the candy gas was that purple
[SPEAKER_01]: punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple punch is super candy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you get a good, it's straight up
grape Jolly Rancher with gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's super, like you said,
it can be candy store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out it was methyl anthranolate
just because I was like, what is
[SPEAKER_01]: artificial grape smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was like, this is exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: My nose is like, I've had enough of those
Jolly Ranchers to tell you like that grape
[SPEAKER_01]: Jolly Rancher has a certain chemical in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same chemical that is in the
purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, I found studies and stuff
that showed cannabis does produce methyl
[SPEAKER_01]: anthranolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what was making it smell like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like sometimes if it smells the same,
it actually is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like grapes can make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Langlangs can make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a few other different things in
nature produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a- Speaking of Oni, we had,
we have a cross of his that we run
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beach grapes, but we call it the,
like one Fino we called conquered crush
[SPEAKER_00]: because it smelled so much like conquered
grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you find methyl anthranolate and
conquered grapes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, but it's pungent and heavy and
stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like a purple punch without
the same beauty that purple punch has,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with all the flavor and all the
potency and, you know, on level 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll trade the frost for, you know,
potency and other things, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm realizing more now, I want to
move away from frostier strains because
[SPEAKER_01]: we've all picked towards frosty for so
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, granted, some of them do have
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm like 50 strands of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I feel like a lot of the strains in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even like some of the old school chem
91, uh, OG Kush, like 90s strains are
[SPEAKER_01]: still some of the strongest smokers today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just me saying that,
like I worked at it as delivery service.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife has worked at a dispensary as
delivery services.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are still saying, I want gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want this classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are people that have been
smoking 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want just OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had one guy, if I, if it wasn't
gassy enough or cushy enough, he just
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't even accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get to his place and be like,
not gassy enough.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he knows himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was the same way with like,
uh, I ordered a Jack Herrera or Herrera,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, here when I was, you know,
just moving out and I was still getting
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff from delivery services and,
um, they came with like an XJ 13 or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, it's a Jack Herrera
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, but it's not Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm looking for Jack Herrera,
not, you know, XJ 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, there's Jack in that and it
smells Jack-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I've smoked XJ 13 and it's
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's different high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Jack with gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just like, there's more like
it's, it's messed up the genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's already a messy genetic profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a whole bunch of, a whole bunch
of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it makes a really beautiful
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love its result.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's again, like with Blue Dream,
one of my favorite daytime smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's underappreciated because
some people don't grow it that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people have, uh, taken that
name and thrown it on a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the real stuff that's like
turpinoline heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's like creative, nice focus,
nice uplifter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of where, where it puts me
at least mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember smoking that back in like 2009
when I was going to Sacramento state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh my, I never knew that
cannabis could taste like a fruit basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like the fruitiest strain that
I've ever had in my life at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: with like, you know, mainly leaning
towards citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just so impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was like one of the first
things where it was not just either purple
[SPEAKER_00]: or OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was kind of what was popular in
the Bay area at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, you know, I, I really like how
this conversation has gone so far and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your dedication to the cannabis
community is up there amongst,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so many people that I have
respect for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and one of the questions that I do
like to ask people when they're on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you do have so much
experience, um, running a weekly podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with home growers,
uh, breeding, home growing yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, seeing different commercial spots in
their, uh, and in their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what would you like to see change in
the cannabis space, whether it be,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, from a home growers perspective or a
commercial perspective or anywhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: between really?
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it'd be more and larger home grows,
lessen up the regulations, lessen up the
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions, allow everyone in California
to grow outside immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 67% of our state that has banned
outdoor or greenhouse cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a shame because we have some of
the best sunlight in the world and we grow
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the best ag products in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think anyone's going to be
harmed by a little bit of cannabis growing
[SPEAKER_01]: outside as is evidenced by the 33% of the
state that's already doing it and having
[SPEAKER_01]: any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need to grow up and be
adults about it and say, this is an
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a horticultural crop as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be grown at field scale,
uh, you know, for bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for lots of reasons that you can make
flower out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make concentrate out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be turned to rope or seed,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think we need to allow a home
grower to grow a hundred plants in their
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard if they want to in a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they need to make that into RSO,
then so be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they want to use all that RSO
themselves, so be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to give it to their friend or
family member who got cancer, then so be
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to lessen up the regulations and
allow more just open free cultivation for
[SPEAKER_01]: home growers because that's where we get
so much more diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's this guy who famously saved
like 150 different types of apples and he
[SPEAKER_01]: would carry around all the different
apples and show them to people and sell
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to sort of be that
person who's doing it because otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we see with the commercial apple
market, there's like four or five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six big varieties that get grown and then
everything else is just lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of like with 50 strains of green
or 50 strands of purple, like I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic diversity to be lost to history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, there's a reason some stuff's
more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff tastes better and some stuff's
easier to grow and, uh, this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like just because something,
even with like ugly looking bud and like
[SPEAKER_01]: going away from the frosty stuff,
like just because something is not the
[SPEAKER_01]: prettiest, um, in like the apple market,
maybe it's not a eating apple,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it becomes a cider apple, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use it for different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's certain stuff that is better
for washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like GMO is not the prettiest flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets kind of Fox tailish looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you grow it as long as it should
and you get it in a right environments
[SPEAKER_01]: where I think it likes to be, it's not
real appealing for flower, but it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the best concentrate in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to be able to say,
Hey, some strains need to be taken,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you're taking it for concentrate
70, 80 days and let that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even allowing like the home growers to
have larger numbers so that they can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: those 16, 22 week, however long,
uh, long flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, if you only can have
six plants, it's sort of limiting you to
[SPEAKER_01]: not growing that strain that takes two,
three, four times as long to finish as
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that would allow people to have
access to what the plan is really for
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately, which is to serve us and,
uh, help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at least how we use it,
uh, to live our best life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's to, you know, have a medicine that
treats one of your ailments, or if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just for the pure enjoyment that adults
are able to have adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all use is medicinal,
even if there's the adult use kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality, but the more we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The better we have, the better the world
is going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, although there's a lot of setbacks,
like there's currently big wildfires and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them have stretched out to San
Diego and I am okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully the San Diego fire department's
been doing an amazing job with the Rowana
[SPEAKER_01]: fire and with the Palafire here recently,
but they are doing incredible,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, it's just, um, the more and
better herb that we have, the better,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think society is going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're at least in my own personal
experience, I feel myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more thoughtful, more level headed,
more centered, uh, more peaceful,
[SPEAKER_01]: happy person when I'm able to,
able to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we have more people in
society, it's like when you're hungry,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're hangry, then your life's going
to be worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're perpetually hungry,
like some people are 20% of the U S kids
[SPEAKER_01]: are, uh, food insecure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know where the next meal is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are literally starving or
underfed, uh, don't have enough nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it's harder for them to focus in
school and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, if you can fill those voids,
if you can give those kids food,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to perform better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think if you can fill that void
and the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll see a big lessening and
endocannabinoid system deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: syndromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think I work in the autism space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everyone, my families are either on
CBD or a ratio of CBD to THC or both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's benefit almost 80 to 90% of the
clients that I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was no pushing on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of found it, got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just advocated on top of like,
Hey, you know, maybe try this or that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe this might help, but they've all
found benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their own ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to expand out to
other maybe elements, Parkinson's and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, like your dad's with the
tremors and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different places that it
can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more we allow home growers to grow
wide volumes and varieties of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more we're going to find those blue
dream hashes that make me stop shaking
[SPEAKER_01]: from a hash, you know, uh, you know,
from my arthritis and you will be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: find those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone will be able to find those
things, maybe not just to help themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to help their father, to help their
grandfather, to help a friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: to help anybody, a stranger in the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we should be able to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an 82 80 plus year old neighbors
that we've got, you know, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in their systems and it's helping
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that we're
technically not doing things all like how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're supposed to, we don't have licenses
in this and that we just like give them
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know, we're not selling them
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a more of just a passion to try
and help people and help ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's our doing, I think we all,
it's not a a hundred percent just a
[SPEAKER_01]: altruistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good feeling we get from seeing
people heal and seeing people get better
[SPEAKER_01]: and they become our advocates as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like we love cannabis, helping
somebody else with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become your advocates and advocates
for everybody because they love it so much
[SPEAKER_01]: and they see how valuable it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are such community based
creatures, human beings that to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: community succeed through the efforts that
you put into it, there's, there's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, there's this huge positive feeling
that is associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like advocating for access is
such a huge part of what needs to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with that advocacy for access,
I feel like help, it helps break down the
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even through the
organizations like normal, where it's to
[SPEAKER_00]: normalize cannabis, you know, everybody's
used to seeing a relative or even
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves or, you know, anybody that they
know have a, have a glass of wine at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day or a few beers or even some
cocktails or not, or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and to add cannabis to that list,
it almost seems like a no brainer,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially considering like no one,
I feel like no one does like the crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that you can do when you get
hammered drunk, when you're the same level
[SPEAKER_00]: of stoned, it's just not necessarily the
same in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to any cannabis or to any bouncer or
to any police officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you rather deal with a room full of
people that are so high, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just stoned off their butt,
or would you rather deal with a group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that is intoxicated on alcohol,
not the amphetamine, coke, and any one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those other drugs you want to name,
like it's so much easier for an officer to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with people that are on like weed or
maybe even like shrooms or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, they're just a lot safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a peaceful society, you know,
like I had my home broken into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what it's like to not have peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what it's like to feel at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more fun to be, you know,
relaxed and chilling out and just not
[SPEAKER_01]: worried about the things that we've
evolved to not have to worry about,
[SPEAKER_01]: like our basic survival, our basic needs
of like, am I safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have food?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have shelter?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, enjoying the lesser and
lesser time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talked about it, the early part in
the show with, you know, even the friends
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm close with, you only get so much
time with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting to, you know, some of us have
anxiety, whether it's social anxiety or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, like even hanging out with
friends or family can be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can lessen that down so that you
can enjoy that time a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like, you know, some people
might say, oh, you're an addict,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a crutch or this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when it's looked at like a
medicine, you wouldn't say that to a
[SPEAKER_01]: diabetic about using insulin or to anybody
else about using their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's sort of an old forgotten
trope at this point in some places and
[SPEAKER_01]: some places still do have the stigma and
stereotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad normal keeps pushing because I am
seeing it become more normalized,
[SPEAKER_01]: like more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you ask somebody if they smoke
and more often than not, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's not even the discussion
of like, is it cigarettes or cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like just cannabis in certain circles
in certain places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's getting to be more and more of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, they'll be like, oh, smoke what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Question mark dot dot dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opens up that conversation because
they'll be like, oh, well, I can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: legally talk about this because maybe I
won't lose my job now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I won't lose my kids or maybe I
won't have my house raided or whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the freedoms that we gain by
having regulation move the right direction
[SPEAKER_01]: allow us to lessen some of those stressors
that are related to or not related to even
[SPEAKER_01]: the use of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the absolutely living with the laws
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more with what you said
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I feel like that's that's a
great note to start wrapping up the show
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to always ask a few sort of
ubiquitous cannabis podcast questions
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end of the show, because I
find them to be just a fun way to wrap up
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the same same questions out to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what would be your favorite strain
of all time, like your desert island
[SPEAKER_00]: strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'd have to say Donnie burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it for effects, flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like I really do like a
potent just like fully even though I might
[SPEAKER_01]: use it during the daytime, for the most
part, it's going to be a nighttime like
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out on the couch, watch something
with the wife, maybe eat a little dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It relieves pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so sedating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I'm kind of a chatty guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the ones, the rare ones that
can kind of allow me to just like Zen out
[SPEAKER_01]: and not feel like I have to talk or think
about something to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, whatever it is, it's just
more of a, I almost joke that it feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like you got whopped over the head with
like a Nerf bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's because my Spanish teacher
used to like literally do that to people
[SPEAKER_01]: and she didn't wouldn't do it hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she had like a little, it was like a
plastic bat and it had like a foam cover
[SPEAKER_01]: around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would like whack people over the
head with it if they like one kid fell
[SPEAKER_01]: asleep and she whopped him with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, old days, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she's never gotten any any amount of
trouble for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some strains, like when I take a hit
of it, like it almost feels like a tingle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I say that is it almost like
hits me like right here on the front of
[SPEAKER_01]: the forehead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like that tingly feeling almost
like like if you've ever been punched,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's not a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the sensation of something,
the pain or like the reaction of the wash,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it travels from like you got hit
in your jaw and it travels up to your
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body is processing what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the punch, obviously it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with like the bong hit, it's like a
nice tingly like, oh, I almost got like a
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pretty like my wife walked by or
something like, oh, I got some tingling
[SPEAKER_01]: like a happy tingle going on, not just
like in like the nether regions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like in your face and like on your
shoulders and down your spine and like in
[SPEAKER_01]: your legs and like you can extend to all
parts of your body, but not even just the
[SPEAKER_01]: tingliness, but sort of the decrease
inflammation, which I think helps with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have I work out a fair amount
and I'm my jobs is very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that that's the main reason pain
relief, relaxation and just ultra potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's probably as close to a 10 out of
10 without being like a fickle fickle chem
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 as I can come across in terms of like
that sedating side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other side of things like Jack the
Ripper would be like the super super high
[SPEAKER_01]: like crazy uplifting rippy sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like I'm so paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: My heart's like like what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so as a follow up to that one,
who would be your favorite breeder of all
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to give it to sub cool,
even though he's not selling seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about somebody who could
get seeds from right now, I'd be skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: house genetics because the burger work,
Donnie burger and otherwise, I think all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the burgers are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double burger, triple burger, Han solo
burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically a really good
representation of what happens when you
[SPEAKER_01]: cross together a good OG with a basically
mix of cookies and chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the GMO is a garlic cookies from
Mamiko seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy skunk master flex bought that
found the Fino that became GMO,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, just the garlic
cookies from them, which is a GMO to chem
[SPEAKER_01]: for chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember which chem it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you cross that into a Larry OG F8
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Larry OG F8 just brings like
power and frost and funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the combination of the GMO and that
Larry OG F8 made that Han solo and then he
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed it back to the GMO, which made the
Donnie burger and any of the burgers,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just combinations of basically all
that genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just works in my endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to find a lot of people it's
like, it might put them to sleep in half
[SPEAKER_01]: an hour, but it's a strong potency almost
across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that guy breeds nothing but
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know anybody else really that
bred anything to F8 that used that male to
[SPEAKER_01]: such a solid effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like his work really seemed to pay off and
in spades.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like burgers are one of my
favorites when it comes to like a gassy or
[SPEAKER_00]: a funky strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Donnie's the one that I haven't
tried, unfortunately, but I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: heard good things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I got an F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got like five seeds of it left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to grow those out and make some
F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And send them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share them with the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he sells it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't want to like step on his toes
if he is selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I even looked like, I think it
hasn't been available for many years at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just one last question then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has been your most memorable smoking
or cannabis related experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: That had to be growing out some of subcool
strains and then meeting Tommy Chong.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife won Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contest and we got to go meet Tommy Chong
at Lowell Cafe, which is like the first
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cafe in Hollywood that was
legally allowed to smoke in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like going to a bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I brought my own weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to pay an unbottling fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how you pay an uncorking fee if you
bring your own wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that because I don't want to buy
their shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had pre-rolled like a box full of
joints and I had a strawberry daiquiri and
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a really strawberry flavored and
then like a kind of almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: margarita, like lemon lime slurpee
flavored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're both more uplifting as the
daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know, good smell,
good flavor and really potent on both of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both just, the flavors rang true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like my wife was the one who won.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was 10 people at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like five seats on each side or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Tommy Chong and like one of the
other promoters or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no seats at the end of the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, I wasn't supposed to,
I was just sitting there like watching
[SPEAKER_01]: like them all smoke or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like within like half an hour,
my wife comes over and she grabs a few of
[SPEAKER_01]: my joints and she's smoking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, whose joints are these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, that's my husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew it, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they invite me over to the table
and they pull up a chair at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to sit and smoke joints with
Tommy Chong for like the next three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like the exact guy you expect
from the movies and TV shows, interviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually come on and done podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you if you ask him, he'd come on
potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done the, we should probably ask him
to come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: So got to get him on at some point,
but he did some of the European,
[SPEAKER_01]: our European buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if it was Percy's grow
room or one of the other guys over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's been on their show a couple of
times actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he was a super cool,
like they say, don't meet your heroes or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because oftentimes you get let down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like their personality is not as maybe
they're busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they just have met way too many
people then get sworn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, can I get a picture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get an autograph?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never ever want to actually be
famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like give me all the riches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would never want to be famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed almost like a curse at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many cases it ruins a lot of lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get them not wanting to have that
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tommy Chong was the opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the cannabis space, I think he's on
Mount Rushmore for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be like him, Willie Nelson,
Snoop, and I don't know, some others,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, he's definitely way up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that I even met him,
that wouldn't even have been on my bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I grew up watching his movies and
stuff and never thought I could meet him
[SPEAKER_01]: and let alone smoke with them for like
hours and have that kind of real human
[SPEAKER_01]: connection, especially with stuff that I
grew myself that like he was blown away
[SPEAKER_01]: by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I got a, they caught him on
video, like smelling the jar and like he
[SPEAKER_01]: had a really big smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's impressed by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, damn, it's just been smoking
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thinks my shit's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm like, oh, I grow good stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like to see somebody like that give a
good reaction, it was almost like a big
[SPEAKER_01]: pat on the back for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, good home grow is going to
be good commercial 10 out of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the commercial guy who was
there with him, who had like a 10 lighter
[SPEAKER_01]: and a hundred lighter, he's like,
dude, I miss the days when I could grow
[SPEAKER_01]: craft like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, look at how white your ashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how good this stuff smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you're doing it even better
than we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That took all those shitty, hating
Instagram comments and people on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet that are like, oh, you're just a
tank grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just a closet grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just a small home grower,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your stuff, this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you haven't smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if it's good or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it could be garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it doesn't look the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's not, but at the same time I'll
take the home grower side 99 out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think they're going to outgrow the
commercial competition unless they are
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing it for the first time and
really didn't get their feet underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, Jack, this has been an awesome
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure that people are going to love
hearing a little bit more about your
[SPEAKER_00]: journey with cultivation and, uh,
your humble beginnings as a, as a leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: pickup boy all the way up through creating
strains that you've seen hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: people grow out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, an inspiring journey that,
you know, mostly we want to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there and more people growing
at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time and, um,
I hope you have just a wonderful rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
Thank you.
