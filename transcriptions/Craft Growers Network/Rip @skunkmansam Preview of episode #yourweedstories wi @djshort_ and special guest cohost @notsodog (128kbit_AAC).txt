[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody and welcome to Your
Weed Stories on the Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're super excited to have what I
am comfortable calling a legend in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of the most well-known breeders
from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: from the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said he was responsible for the
blueberry and the flow and we're super
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to have him on the show so welcome
DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey thank you great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks and before we started I wanted to
take a moment to acknowledge that this
[SPEAKER_02]: week we lost skunk man Sam and you know
he's he's a very what is it called when
[SPEAKER_02]: people want to choose one side or the
other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Polarizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Polarizing figure exactly thank you
Francis he's my my dictionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a very polarizing figure as is
Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people have felt
throughout the last years that they either
[SPEAKER_02]: have to choose one side or the other and
frankly I think that they both contributed
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendously to our community and they
should both be honored and you know I I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't think now is the time to discuss any
controversies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we need to all send our best
wishes to their families and you know for
[SPEAKER_02]: a second just think about he did make
tremendous contributions to our cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community and not so Doug you were saying
something before we started I think it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: valid point that if you want to say it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean well I'll do two points one I
was talking to a friend and I kind of feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like Neville was sort of like the the
Johnny Appleseed of our community right
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sam skunk man and Rob Clark were sort
of like the Luther Burbanks in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know Neville was the first
person where you could just like I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: and Gabby and I did this a ton you could
open up a catalog and there was an order
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet and you could write down what you
wanted and you could send that dude money
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could get seeds and that was
impossible before you had to know someone
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville was the first person where it was
like here's a catalog right and here's an
[SPEAKER_01]: address you know and and so he made it
very very much easier to get seed you know
[SPEAKER_01]: because before it was really a who you
know now you know you had to know someone
[SPEAKER_01]: you had to know someone in your little
circle and Sam didn't do that he was a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different but he did when he was fleeing
persecution in America he did bring an
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous amount of genetics that he both
had worked on and things he had gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: from his friends over to Europe and then
when those things blended with what the
[SPEAKER_01]: Europeans were doing that was sort of the
foundation for all these you know like me
[SPEAKER_01]: or Gabby or kids looking through catalogs
and being like ooh there's there's people
[SPEAKER_01]: of a certain generation that have all
those first catalogs almost memorized
[SPEAKER_01]: because you would sit there and smoke a
joint and read and dream you know and so
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys created a lot of dreams and you
know I mean I think you know there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah there's there's controversy and stuff
like that but I think that I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: when somebody passes or something like
that they have they have you know maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: their wives children loved ones friends
people that have known them forever and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all flawed so it's better to focus
on what people's contributions were what
[SPEAKER_01]: the positive things about you know
people's lives were and it's all easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: tear each other down it's a lot better I
think to like lift each other up and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of a that's all I have to say
about the Vietnam War but but I will say
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we won't touch on it when I first
went to Amsterdam like you know there are
[SPEAKER_01]: beefs in cannabis there are conflicts and
I would say that like that was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: oldest ones and so we weren't there we
don't have to rehash it but we can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: cantankerous bunch and we don't all get
along all the time you know so kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like Sasha our Slovenian hobbit Sam was a
bit of a hobbit you know he wasn't in the
[SPEAKER_02]: public eye and so I think it's kind of
unfair to to even try to choose sides when
[SPEAKER_02]: most of us don't even know a fraction of
the story you know we just know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that were more vocal said from from
our perspective right basically everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: in this room both Sam and Sam and and
Neville did a whole bunch to make good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics more accessible to a lot more
people and they played a huge role in that
[SPEAKER_01]: they really did I think there's no denying
that well I'll say I'm you know I got my
[SPEAKER_00]: first copy of that catalog it was a
mimeograph sheets right just just standard
[SPEAKER_00]: paper sized with the list on there I think
they were what 30 bucks for 10 seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time I was I understood the value
of the land race genetics I had some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that were going over to Amsterdam
Europe other places and always put feelers
[SPEAKER_00]: out say hey find me these land race but it
was right around that era that they
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared pretty much everything they
were selling was some cross they did they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't selling the bag seed per se
collected from country of origin so that
[SPEAKER_00]: little juxta or what do you call it
bifurcation in the road where making our
[SPEAKER_00]: own seed as opposed to land race kind of
happened in that era so that's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little little side point to that like I
said I tried but I wasn't interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's work I saw the flaw in that
or I saw the value you know in those land
[SPEAKER_00]: races and that became the focus at the
time but they weren't selling like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: land race varieties straight from the
country
