[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Gabby Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we start today's video,
I wanted to apologize in advance for the
[SPEAKER_02]: crummy audio on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the reason why we haven't released it
sooner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was considering re-recording it because
I selected the wrong mic and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really sound as good as it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I decided was this content from
Dell was so amazing and spontaneous that I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't really want to lose it by
re-recording it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth is, he's doing most of the
talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know every now and again,
I'm asking some questions here and there
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not going to sound that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the stories from Dell, I think are
really worth tolerating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you guys do too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy this podcast
with my friend Dell.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Gabby from the Craft Growers
Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to do another podcast with
you guys today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, as always, we've got Nick Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our special guest is Dell Potter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an amazing story that not only do I
think you've never heard, you'll probably
[SPEAKER_01]: never hear another story like this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got an amazing cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, he's a modern day psychedelic
pioneer, a modern day psychedelic pioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we should just get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dell, why don't you just tell us a little
bit about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd like you to start as early on
in your story as you can, like even the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time you were exposed to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background in training is in medical
anthropology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up specializing in a branch of
that called psychiatric anthropology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really focused on using the
anthropological perspective to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: transform the way we approach mental
health interventions and psychiatry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really my focus throughout my
academic years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some clinical training at the San
Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute and
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I was kind of going to go in the
direction of being a clinician,
[SPEAKER_00]: a more informed type of clinician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't use psychology as the basis,
but rather anthropology, which I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: asked different questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked the same questions of a person
that you would ask of a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this person exist in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they get their food from?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are their relationships?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, to me, that perspective was
more, I think, beneficial than psychology,
[SPEAKER_00]: which focused far more on intra-psychic
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started out looking to be a
clinician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a really transformative
experience early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was I went to a party,
a faculty party at UC Berkeley at the
[SPEAKER_00]: anthropology department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it was a different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 1971, 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really struck by the,
well, first of all, let me just describe
[SPEAKER_00]: this party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was dressed in period costume,
like from the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy who looked exactly like
Mozart playing the piano.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was playing perfectly Mozart piano
concertos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what I found is that
anthropologists tend to be Renaissance
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is they have talent in all these
different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm walking around this party and
there are luminaries in anthropology,
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Rabinal and Clifford Gertz,
people who are pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were arguing about some aspect of
how we interpret culture and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of bouncing around this party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a bunch of people that are kind
of collected in a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mostly undergraduates and
everybody's smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faculty, students, everybody's smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a haze of weed throughout the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm holding a glass of red wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walk over and it's this researcher
who I've actually been at a seminar at
[SPEAKER_00]: Esalen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which if you guys aren't familiar with
Esalen, I'll tell you a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the researcher Claudio Naranjo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pretty famous for doing the early
Ayahuasca studies and developing kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: an approach to shamanism and teaching
shamanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had met him at Esalen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I walked over, he recognized me and
we just started chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, look, you would really like
to meet Alexander Schulgen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be going to their salon get
togethers that they have on Friday nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to come with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd heard about Alexander Schulgen and
I was like thrilled to come to some event
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up meeting him and we went to,
and I met Alexander Schulgen and his wife
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of other people who were sort
of 60s icons, Alan Ginsberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, many people may not know who
Schulgen is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just briefly tell who he is?
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, the father of modern
psychedelic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't invent MDMA, but he discovered a
more efficient synthesis route than
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody had previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he experimented with novel chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He invented 2CB.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he worked with DMT, five methoxy
DMT, a whole range of tryptamines and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenolamines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically phenolamines being mescaline
type related compounds, tryptamines being
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD, psilocybin DMT related compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he played around with novel chemistry
in all of these areas and developed many
[SPEAKER_00]: of the psychedelic compounds that have
become the basis of research today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his wife Anne was a psychotherapist
and she kind of bridged the chemistry to
[SPEAKER_00]: the person in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these salons were pretty intense
meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people who were, you know,
icons, as I said, in the 60s, Ken Kesey
[SPEAKER_00]: would be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Alan Ginsberg, Alan Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Terrence McKenna there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of very interesting people would
show up and it was a highly charged
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really liked about it, it was real
interdisciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have artists, you'd have musicians,
you'd have chemists, psychedelic chemists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have psychologists and psychiatrists
all interacting and finding a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: common ground together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so Claudio Nirano takes me to this
meeting and I'm introduced to Shulgin for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, hey, I understand you're
interested in research around the short
[SPEAKER_00]: acting tryptamines because I was doing
research on ayahuasca and indigenous use
[SPEAKER_00]: of ayahuasca at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you know, look, let me,
I'd love to talk chemistry with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of gave me a master class over
about a year's period in that genre class
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemicals, the short acting
tryptamines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is short acting, I'm sorry, quick
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does short acting just mean like rapid
onset?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both rapid onset and short duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, DMT, you know, 15 minutes,
20 minutes, the experiences is almost over
[SPEAKER_00]: and within a half an hour, you're back on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're maybe a little sparkly,
but you know, it's a very short acting
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and five methoxy DMT is not
dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really changed my direction
meeting him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up going more in the direction of
specializing in neuropharmacology and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and just kind of altered my
life's path.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to that party that night,
I saw Alan Ginsberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was sitting on the floor writing poetry
and I had met him before at a conference,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the earliest psychedelic conference
that MAPS put on the multidisciplinary
[SPEAKER_00]: association for psychedelic studies,
which now is pretty famous for bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: forward MDMA as a treatment for PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had uneven success, but you know,
back then they were first starting out and
[SPEAKER_00]: this was one of the first psychedelic
conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I had met Alan Ginsberg at
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on a panel with a Buddhist teacher
named Trungpa and Ram Dass, Richard
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpert, you know, the other half of
Timothy Leary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the panel was I thought was
really funny because it immediately,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I had some immediate affinity
with Alan Ginsberg because somebody in the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience asked the question, when was the
last time you took LSD?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Trungpa said, oh, it was about 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I found this new path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't need it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opened the door for me, but now I
found, you know, a way to maintain that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of state without drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ram Dass kind of said the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you know, I haven't had it for
five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've opened the door and now I'm going
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ginsberg got up there and he said,
well, I'm on it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be, you know,
appropriate for me to take it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like an hour before this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was immediately, oh yeah,
that's my guy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw him later on and he asked me if
he could get a ride back to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave, I had him in the back of my
car driving back to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm asking this guy every question
about Jack Kerouac, about Neil Cassidy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he, when I went to
Shulgin's party, he saw me and he
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately recognized me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that party was really a turning point
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided, you know, these people were
inspiring and, you know, it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: different time back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a time when drug
manufacturing and drug trafficking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was more or less looked at as a
high calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very special kind of group that
Shulgin represented and they inspired me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked up to them and I wanted to
grow up to be a drug trafficker and
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we had kind of an idea that
this was a messianic purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were out spreading the psychedelic
message and, you know, the laws were not
[SPEAKER_00]: really important to us, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a time also, I should say,
of civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The war in Vietnam was still underway and
people were protesting and protesting
[SPEAKER_00]: against the value system that kind of
supported that war.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drug trafficking, drug manufacturing
was looked at as a kind of civil
[SPEAKER_00]: disobedience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old were you in 1971, just out of
curiosity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, you know, young and easy to lead
around, you know, and I had taken LSD when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 15 and that experience was
transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was transformative, too, for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sent me in a particular
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Owsley LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an Owsley double dome, which I
think you were supposed to split them in
[SPEAKER_00]: half, but I just took the whole thing,
which ended up being about 300 micrograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a pretty powerful experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I connected to universal
consciousness, floated above my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that message translated to,
you know, I want to spread this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make these compounds available
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of became that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the turning point for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I continued, you know,
I did a lot of research among indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: groups throughout Latin America,
trying to learn and understand about the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of psychedelic use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with the Cofan in Colombia,
the Shuar in Ecuador, the Yanomami people
[SPEAKER_00]: in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spent quite a bit of time with the
Yanomami people in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I had kind of my first
DMT experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this had been previous to when I went
to that party at Children's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, what they do is they have a
blowgun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use to hunt birds and they get seeds
and botanicals that are high in five
[SPEAKER_00]: methoxy DMT and DMT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make like this bolus and they put
it in the bamboo blowgun and you put it up
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose and another guy blows it up your
nose, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they were trying to teach me a
lesson about dosage, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hit the back of my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hit my throat and I was suddenly higher
than I ever could possibly imagine being
[SPEAKER_00]: in like seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being shot out of a cannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And foreground and background changed
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: My unconscious came forward and my
conscious mind receded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, this is something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I got interested in the
Shorter Acting Tryptamines was from that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up doing a lot of this
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did research among the Mazatec in
central Mexico in a little town called
[SPEAKER_00]: Huatla de Jimenez, which was famous for
introducing psilocybin mushrooms to the
[SPEAKER_00]: world in 1957, a JP Morgan banker,
R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gordon Wasson, who had written a book
called Soma, The Divine Mushroom of
[SPEAKER_00]: Immortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that book, he pitched the idea that in
the Vedic scriptures, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: description of a substance called Soma,
which produces enlightenment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he argued that it was Amanita muscaria
that was being talked about, that red
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom with the white flecks on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was the first one to lead a party
that went to Huatla de Jimenez to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin mushroom ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went there and did research
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was there, I was kind of
looking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I'll tell you is people
don't realize that going to graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: school, that's like a form of slavery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanna work you as much as possible
for like no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was really having trouble getting
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of thinking, I'm gonna need
some side hustle if I'm ever gonna make it
[SPEAKER_00]: through graduate school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was with the Mazatec,
this idea just kind of popped into my
[SPEAKER_00]: head, because they had shown me the
mushrooms growing and I saw them growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, they showed me the ones that
kind of grew easily out of cow patties,
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybe cubensis, it's widely used now,
that's the mushroom of commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, it was just sort of a wild
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got this idea, I'm gonna culture
that mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take the cultures into the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna figure out how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna grow it commercially,
and I'm gonna start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be my little side hustle that
allowed me to get through graduate school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I- And had you ever grown any mushrooms
at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I knew a lot about mushroom taxonomy,
just from studying ethnobotany with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazatec, but I didn't really know anything
about cultivation or how to grow them or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started reading like mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was self taught and set up a
motel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I ended up, okay, I'm gonna go get
some cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, where you really wanna get the
best ones are in Chiapas, in Palenque,
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of Palenque.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had kind of a crude map,
and I thought I'd just go down there and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna find these mushrooms,
do a live tissue culture, and isolate that
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, smuggle those cultures into the
United States and figure out how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could find these mushrooms in the
United States, in southern latitudes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rainy season, but the ones that were
in the region around Palenque,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was assured were like way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the state of the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up taking whatever little money
I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: My aunt would give me money for books,
and basic expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up putting that into a flight
to Palenque and was determined to find
[SPEAKER_00]: them and isolate the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of an unusual time in that
region because there was a Zapatista
[SPEAKER_00]: uprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know about the
Zapatistas, they were a collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous groups, four or five different
indigenous groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who basically declared an independent
state in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Mexican government was freaked
out, is this gonna be the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of indigenous revolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ordered the army to go down there
and mess with them, but the army would not
[SPEAKER_00]: fire on indigenous people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real cultural boundary in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous people represent the cultural
soul of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they couldn't really get the army to
interact with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just kind of isolated them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went down to that region at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a little scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to go through roadblocks and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that
distinguishes Palenque are the
[SPEAKER_00]: archeological ruins there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was standing in the jungle and
they saw a little tiny piece of rock that
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought might be some kind of
indigenous archeological site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started digging and they found a
whole city underneath all this jungle and
[SPEAKER_00]: a pyramid and a whole city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was fascinated with those ruins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, well, how am I gonna
find these mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sitting in a canteen and there
was this Mexican hippie who was sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there in one table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came up to me and said,
hey, gringo, you wanna get some mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, I'm exactly looking for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get me some?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first day he brings me these
regular mushrooms and is gonna try and
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking I'm stupid enough to mistake
regular mushrooms for psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, get the hell out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back very apologetic the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, look, I can take you to where
the mushrooms are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have an uncle who's a shaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know all about these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, great, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'll just charge you a daily
fee as a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have much money and I was
like, okay, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started digging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started going out looking for
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first places we went to were super
disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to this one place, it was really
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually found some mushrooms,
but they were all dried up specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we walked through this cow pasture and
these were like some of the sickliest
[SPEAKER_00]: looking cows I'd ever seen in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole field was like full of these
little tiny ticks that they have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm walking through in my shorts and
sandals and then realized that something's
[SPEAKER_00]: crawling on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's some of these little tiny ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go nuts trying to get them off of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy tells me, hey, those ticks
will crawl up any hole they can find and
[SPEAKER_00]: make a home there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just freaked out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one unsuccessful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, after a number of thoughts,
false starts, he says, okay, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: one, this is the time, we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the time we're doing this,
we have to drive through a military check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bunch of these kids standing
there, they're 17 years old with AK-47s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they scrutinize me, but they mostly
talk to him, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A gringo and a Mexican together in the
same car, they're looking for drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's drugs here somewhere, some kind of
drugs are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of did a cursory search,
but they were giving me an eyeball,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's something out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went directly to the pyramid in
Palenque, which I had been kind of jogging
[SPEAKER_00]: around every morning just for exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we turn around, we go directly to the
pyramid and he finds this trail leading
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the pyramid that goes into the
jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going through the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm in my tennis shoes this
time, because I wanted a little better
[SPEAKER_00]: footwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going through the jungle,
parrots, a little light rain mist starts
[SPEAKER_00]: falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come out of the jungle and we cross
this river.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm up to my waist in a river
crossing and I'm all, well, the party's
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to be soaked for the
rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come out into this pasture that's
like this gorgeous pasture with this grass
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like that Hawaiian crab grass that
has like a cushion to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this field are these Jersey cows,
some of the most beautiful cows I'd ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's cow patties throughout this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there they are, giant specimens of
mushrooms just growing perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I put together a little lab in the
motel I was staying at in the bathroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: lined it with plastic and set up a sort of
a lab to do the culture work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had like a funky glove box that I
used and a little pressure cooker with me
[SPEAKER_00]: to make mushroom media and ended up going
back to that spot and collecting all these
[SPEAKER_00]: specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were gigantic, you know,
really vigorous strain or a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: cubensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolated the cultures successfully,
put them into test tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all I had to do was get them
across the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, again, nobody had ever
really thought about psilocybin mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: except maybe in Texas and Florida where
they grew wild and they would chase kids
[SPEAKER_00]: out of cow pastures who were looking for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody had ever thought of growing
them commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had this friend, an older man,
his name is George, George Shaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was, you know, a really close
friend who was basically a smuggler.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would go across the border to Nogales
on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was also a coke smuggler and all
kinds of other types of smugglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was smuggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know he was quite adept at getting
back and forth across the border because
[SPEAKER_00]: he looked so innocuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about five foot six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like he had a big white beard and
looked like a leprechaun version of Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Claus.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so charming and disarming that
people would just never look twice at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had this thermos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these days, the thermoses had these
sleeves that you could take out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stuck the culture tubes inside the
thermos, put the sleeve back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fills it up with coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looked like it was just a coffee
thermos, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the coffee wasn't hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the coffee was hot, but it was
insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an insulation between it and the
culture tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just went right across the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was waiting in Nogales and now I had the
cultures in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I had to figure out how to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was living in a little apartment in
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured, you know, I've got to get to a
more rural location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just kind of looking around,
where should I go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up looking in Sebastopol just
outside of Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very small little ranchettes,
you know, two acres, three acres,
[SPEAKER_00]: up to five acres sometimes, but quite
isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a rental there and decided,
you know, this is where I'm going to do my
[SPEAKER_00]: proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to duplicate what I'd seen in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I researched compost and made a compost
pile of washed cow manure, because that
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of what I saw in nature,
and straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And read about composting and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went out and got some fresh-room
compost and got together enough compost
[SPEAKER_00]: for four beds that I laid out in various
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three were kind of in direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was under mottled sunlight under the
canopy of a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I seeded them with spawn,
which I learned how to make, just
[SPEAKER_00]: self-taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that were in the sun,
they didn't make it, though the mycelium
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered it all with plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one that was under the canopy,
it was cool enough that the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate was colonized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, now what I want to
duplicate after having colonized this
[SPEAKER_00]: little, I kind of just laid them out on a
four foot by eight foot kind of little,
[SPEAKER_00]: about four or five inch thick compost bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, now I've got to
duplicate what happens in Palenque.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to make rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pulled the plastic off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all fully colonized and just started
raining on them and thinking, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to duplicate what I see in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few days, nothing's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also working at a job, a cultural
resource study at Lake Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_00]: which hadn't been flooded at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to preserve the
cultural resources before they flooded it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm commuting up to Ukiah from
Sebastopol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a friend who's kind of watching
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, look, just water this once a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a nice watering and just tell me
if anything happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he calls me up and says, hey,
I think you should come back because
[SPEAKER_00]: something's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come back and there's like two
little mushrooms coming out of the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like astonished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have to make all this compost to
get two little mushrooms, that's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I continued to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of a week,
suddenly a carpet of mushrooms grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a whole edge-to-edge canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single square inch of that bed was
covered with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvested one that weighed a pound and
dried down to about an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have the problem of how I got to
pick these things and I got to dry them
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first experiments at drying didn't work
out well because I tried to dry at a low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature because I wanted to preserve
the active principle that was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would actually turn them black
because it was like too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up using the, well,
no, they would just, yeah, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they have this bluing reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: When psychedelic mushrooms hit the air,
they create this bluing reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was making that worse, like making
it even darker with cold air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I set these racks up over
the heater vents in my house and just
[SPEAKER_00]: started stacking them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that started working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started coming out perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really white, white stems and beautiful
gold caps that were like, looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: gold, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first I was like, I'm gonna cut all
the tops off and I'll put the stems in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle and then align the outside of the
bag with the caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody was, well, I'm just gonna
take the caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems, they must be lesser quality
because you put them in the middle and
[SPEAKER_00]: conceptually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just like everything's so
primitive because nobody's ever done it
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to figure out how to make
these things presentable and cosmetically
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up understanding that you just
have to cut the mushrooms whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry them whole and lay them carefully in
the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way nobody will think that this
is good and this is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how I start packaging them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're coming out really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all these gold caps and white,
white stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've got to figure out where I'm
gonna sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew a guy because he had lived down
the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was David Logan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his actual real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: His nickname was DL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say that in those days in the
drug trafficking milieu, everybody had
[SPEAKER_00]: these nicknames.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his nickname was DL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was from Brooklyn and he was a real
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had all these sayings.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of a New York guy in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had all these sayings for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he had a guy who drove for him and he
called him, that's my punk in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would say stuff like money talks,
bullshit walks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got divorced from his wife and he
told me the payments that he had to make
[SPEAKER_00]: to her were the fuck can I get for the
fuck can I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just had all these funny sayings
about all this stuff.
Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we really hit it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was famous as the guy who was the
acid connection at Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the guy who made Woodstock
essentially because of all the LSD he
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't the guy with the brown acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't the brown acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the good acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we came out to California with his
partner and his partner was this guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miami Sammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we called him Sammy two sticks because
he was paraplegic and he would run around
[SPEAKER_00]: on two sticks all the time, you know,
on crutches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was so funny is he had this
wheelchair and he decked it out and he
[SPEAKER_00]: would be in clubs and all over town with
this wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had like a mobile bar set up in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had like drawers with all kinds of
different weed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just kind of like his mobile
dispensary he would get around in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hooked up with Miami Sammy,
came out to the coast and he just started
[SPEAKER_00]: selling weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, ecstasy and all kinds of
stuff in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was pretty much the guy,
you know, started selling Thai weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at that time there were all
these, you know, regional varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you sort of identified what
the experience was going to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had all these varieties from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had some varieties from Columbia,
varieties from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started selling Thai weed and
became famous for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I knew because he sold LSD that
he was probably the likely person I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring these mushrooms to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I brought them to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, yeah, this is really
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like the way you're doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like I'm not involved in
any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're completely independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically turning straw into gold
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of upset him in a way because
it upended the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to go to Columbia to get
it, you know, and you didn't have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and he says, and he started
making all these derisive comments like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, Dell, how many mushrooms can you
pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I didn't tell him,
you know, I can get an army of people to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick mushrooms, but he started making all
these derisive comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I don't like the way you're doing
this, but I'll sell them for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I charged 800 bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 50 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the wholesale price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to put this in perspective,
what year was this in?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like 1974, 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, today, you know,
pounds of mushrooms are maybe like $500 on
[SPEAKER_02]: like the absolute high end, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like $800 a pound in 1971.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we'll have to do some calculations
and see how much, I'm gonna actually
[SPEAKER_02]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how much, how much is $800 today?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is $800?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause like that sounds like a
ridiculous number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just figured, I don't know, 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, I was throwing darts at
a dart board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea how to price them.
[SPEAKER_02]: $6,235 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm selling these things in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did people have enough money to buy
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like that's, that seems like,
I'm glad you got it, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's only $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your calculations may be a little
bit deceiving because tie sticks retail
[SPEAKER_00]: two and a half grams tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were exotics, Gabby, you know,
an ounce of Colombian was about 40 bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that was somewhere above
Mexican, but not quite as good as Tyree,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Mexican 30 bucks an ounce
somewhere in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 bucks an ounce for lamb's bread from
Jamaica, you know, so it did kind of fit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought how many doses, let's see,
you know, we, we kind of consider three
[SPEAKER_00]: grams to be a whopping pretty good dose of
mushrooms today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I got 28 grams in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's quite a few doses for 50
bucks, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it works out to five bucks a dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not LSD, which was around a
dollar a dose, but you couldn't get LSD
[SPEAKER_00]: because the major supply chains had been
disrupted by the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden here comes this natural
product that you're absolutely sure it is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a white powder that you could
deceive someone with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's the natural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 50 bucks, everybody was paying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I think they were going out the door
at about a thousand retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, I, I sold what I had to
DL and then I realized this guy's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be hard to work with, but I knew another
guy, uh, his name was Richard and he lived
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the Inverness, you know,
out near point raise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was from Red Hook in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all my connects were from New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and cause they know how to manage
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's face it, you know, and he had a
thriving business shipping weed from
[SPEAKER_00]: California, uh, to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I showed them to him and he's
like, he was like a very well organized,
[SPEAKER_00]: solid businessman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took one look and he says,
I will take every pound you can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that mandate, I decided,
well, Sebastopol as nice as it is with its
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three acre parcels here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be what I need to create
a commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to get way further out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd already, I grew a little weed in
the yard next to where I was doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms because heck, I'm in Sebastopol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might as well grow a little weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the neighbor kids came over and
grabbed some branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew my security was less than ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I decided, well, I'm just going to
have to get further out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I'm just going to drive up
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highway one and, you know, find a good
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kept driving and driving and
then everything became more rural and
[SPEAKER_00]: wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I went through sea ranch
and I crossed the wall of the river into
[SPEAKER_00]: Gualala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all, man, this is a really funky
little Berg here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like the spot, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started hanging around trying to
find a rental and I found this guy had a
[SPEAKER_00]: log cabin for rent and it had
outbuildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were, you know, really sheet rock
garages that were just perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, for, uh, an indoor grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I had resolved at that point,
it's time to take this inside so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: control all the environmental variables
that I can't do outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm, I had been reading enough
at that point about mushroom growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew kind of what the parameters were,
what the environmental controls were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, okay, let's, let's step
this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I converted these garages into,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One second.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you were reading on growing
mushrooms, but were you reading on growing
[SPEAKER_02]: regular mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading on growing regular mushrooms
because I figured out these are what are
[SPEAKER_00]: called coprophilic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow on manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reasoned that the conventional
mushrooms, which also grow on manure would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably have the same nutritional
requirements and cultivation would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used that information and there were
some books out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this one that was really good
called mushroom growing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was by this English guy who was,
you know, sort of one of these English
[SPEAKER_00]: country gentlemen growing mushrooms,
you know, in the countryside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I fancied myself kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, like, uh, a boutique farmer
in the countryside growing mushrooms at
[SPEAKER_00]: the small scale like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that book was super
instructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I started converting these
garages and I made turn one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedrooms in this place into a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I started growing really
successfully and I took the first batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like, uh, you know, I think I had
about 200 pounds out of my first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took that to, uh, Richard in
Inverness and it was like, gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just fueled, that fueled the fire
because he sent that back East and people
[SPEAKER_00]: went nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, we got to get more of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I said, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to find something that's even large,
a larger commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to even get more remote and more,
you know, uh, more infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had, I was in the feed store and
there was this guy, uh, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had these Turkey barns in point arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't have a crazy nickname, like Johnny
two sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the guys on the, on the sales side had
those names, you know, and we'll get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like bifocal Bob, uh, who was head of the
Jewish mafia, uh, in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, would cash you on any size load that
you delivered to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Manhattan awareness warehouse
cash on delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anyway, uh, so I was like,
well, uh, he, he starts talking about some
[SPEAKER_00]: renter he has that has trashed his rental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of overhear all this and step
in, you know, Hey, I'm looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: rental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he says, well, it's got a three
bedroom house there and it's got 10 Turkey
[SPEAKER_00]: barns that this guy was using for turkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I said, well, let's go take a
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these 10 Turkey barns are giant
commercial buildings with concrete floors,
[SPEAKER_00]: with drains, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I got to do is clean them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of these, they're,
they're like 30 by a hundred, each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these 10 Turkey bars, I've said,
I can just fill these things up with
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms and get an army of people to
help me pick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know, made the deal with,
with, uh, with, even though the indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing was not a thing then, uh,
there were all these strange characters
[SPEAKER_00]: running around Mendocino, uh, at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the guy just naturally
thought there's drugs in here somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but he didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just pay me my 400 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he wanted for a rental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he might've,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, so he's all, you can have
all the Turkey barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, don't bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have anything to do with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay me the 400 bucks every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go out there like 10 acres,
you know, no one's going to venture on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was way, you know, super remote
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went up this gated road, uh,
that I could completely control access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I called up my buddy cowboy
Scott, uh, and, uh, he was, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the construction industry in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, I'm going to graduate
school and I'm doing all this work on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I call up cowboy Scott and I said,
this is the guy I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ramrod, this, this job, uh,
he was from the construction industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd run huge crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you know, look, I've got,
I know the team that I can bring for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought his brother-in-law and all
these people up there and just transformed
[SPEAKER_00]: those barns into mushroom growing into a
mushroom growing facility with
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental controls, with heating and
cooling and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put out a lot of the money on,
you know, I kind of took him on as a
[SPEAKER_00]: partner, not a full partner, but like as a
kind of partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, mostly, uh, you know, he brought all
these other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing that he,
that was super cool is he did grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: little weed and he knew these Vietnamese,
uh, families who would do the trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who he said, let's use these
guys to, to do all the picking and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting and packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a crew making compost and
eventually I actually got machinery to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost and that was inside one of the
barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the compost with forklifts and
boxes would be distributed to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had this full on commercial
mushroom farm going.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still good until late seventies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly we're producing thousands of
pounds of mushrooms literally and drying
[SPEAKER_00]: them and the drying operation now is
expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got forced air eaters and cabinets
and shelves and racks and just tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms are getting processed out of
this facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I get a call from Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, when am I going to see you?
[SPEAKER_00]: When am I going to see you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put together 4,000 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dried mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had these you haul boxes,
uh, you know, the dish pack you haul
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put exactly 50 pounds in each one
of those boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So filled up, you know, all these boxes,
put them into a you haul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I had to do was successfully drive
down the coast and to, to point raised to
[SPEAKER_00]: Inverness with these boxes and boxes of
mushrooms, 4,000 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just felt, you know, you've got
all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was scared out of my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was like, you know,
I just felt like another set of packing in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you couldn't do that because you
couldn't do that because there was too
[SPEAKER_00]: many mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like boxes right to the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the door, there'd be boxes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I, I, I got this all packed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that, you know, that reminds me
of, um, back in the day in Willets,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not, it's not like this anymore,
but back in the day in Willets,
[SPEAKER_02]: people would harvest their weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They felt the heat was coming or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd have all the weed in the back of
the pickup truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and like people would literally
drive down the highway and you'd see
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking weed like coming out the back of
their pickup truck, but they were,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were making an exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it wasn't dry yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just harvested, pull it up,
throw it in the back and we'll dry it
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, uh, I had figured,
you know, look, I just went all this
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't believe this thing was
working like a Swiss watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, over here, we had the crew
making compost to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got these Vietnamese families,
uh, you know, didn't blink about the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're fine with 24 seven
picking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, we've got the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't want, you know,
the last minute to have this you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to get it seized or, you know,
so that ride down the coast was very
[SPEAKER_00]: scary, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to Richard and he says,
okay, come meet me at my office and point
[SPEAKER_00]: raise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he passes me a suitcase with millions
and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, two suitcases actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and I had people to pay,
you know, obviously, but there was
[SPEAKER_00]: significant profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I was off to the races at that
point and continued to do the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom growing for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, what started happening was
competitors emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was kind of a price war,
but at that point I was so far ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like didn't really even matter,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this time, I should say also the
cultural zeitgeist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beginning to change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Reagan came into office and he
was like, you know, the drug war and Nancy
[SPEAKER_00]: just say no and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, you know, interest in
psychedelics started falling off,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fell off a cliff really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my demand started really decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted cocaine, you know,
all of a sudden, uh, it was exemplified
[SPEAKER_00]: by, I don't know, you've seen that movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gordon Gekko, greed is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wall street, you know, and
psychedelics were looked at as kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: indulgence, you know, like a, like a waste
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what we want to do is,
is make money in business, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cocaine emerged as the drug of
choice and people had less and less use
[SPEAKER_00]: for mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting, but I had already
started another hobby at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, uh, starting to grow cannabis
indoors, the first indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had these great facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I thought, well, I mean,
it was experiment with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you describe your first indoor
grow just in that's funny because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know high times was happening,
but high tags was a glossy commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really, for growers,
you know, it wasn't, uh, the nuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: bolts of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another magazine came out that was printed
like a newsprint called since Samia tips
[SPEAKER_00]: out of, uh, out of Eugene, uh,
Tom Alexander, I'm still friends with him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend of mine actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went up to Eugene, you know,
I'm reading this and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, street lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to use street lights inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those days, they didn't have like
pre-made little, you know, ballasts and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything all pre-made for you had to
build it yourself from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was building it on plywood and stuff,
like little plywood boxes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you become an expert at electrical
wiring yourself at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, I can wire Hoover dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to, uh, you know, I I've gained
so much knowledge about wiring,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, electrical, uh, environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went up to Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, to his grow store, uh, blue moon,
I think it was called, and this guy's just
[SPEAKER_00]: out there selling these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is how you grow
cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it seemed kind of
ballsy, you know, in a way, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's got a whole store selling this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I walk in and I buy like 40 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the biggest purchase he'd
seen at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, Oh my God, let me help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like 1979, I think like 1979,
1978, 79.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much were they selling the lights for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cheap, like 120 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, everybody at that time
thought, okay, you veg under halides and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you flour under sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody figured out,
well, you could just use the sodiums the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, you know, it's not that much
different, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sodiums were more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, they, they were a little more
pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe in the $200 range,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get my 40 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, gosh, a thousand Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're, we're, we're not messing around
Gabby, you know, we're blowing some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started going to the growth
store and I'll give a little, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a plug cause it's not there anymore,
but Ross at East coast hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest he had was a 430 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, we had, we had thousands,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so anyway, let me just tell you
that my first grow, I pack all these
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand that heat is not
necessarily beneficial to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, you know, and then I'd been
reading articles about CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to Jack this up with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, we're going to really have
a huge production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sealed the room up and the heat goes
through the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, ah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, you know, tropical zone,
you know, it's not going to hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants just like were,
they produce these flowers that were like
[SPEAKER_00]: one long stock with a calyx here,
calyx here, a calyx here, a calyx here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just so stretched out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to survive from the
amount of heat that was in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I was, uh, you know, it was an
interesting actual scientific experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: because you found out that cannabis goes
to great lengths to keep the sex cells
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it has to, it will create these
long stretch branches just to keep,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it cool for survival purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's cold, and this is what was
funny, I had one room that I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any heat in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ice cold up, you know, on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those buds came out beautiful,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I guess you got to
pay attention to the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I started working from that
perspective and things started coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew I had been introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy who lived on the coast,
great guy, Herbie Herbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the manager for Journey,
the manager for Santana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He managed The Dead for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pretty famous guy in the music
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had his own group called Cyclops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, famous guy, beautiful human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he, he was, uh, kind of the one who
introduced me to like high end weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like really kind of sewer level
because he, he was nuts for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, he introduced me,
he had all these international visitors at
[SPEAKER_00]: this estate that he had on the coast
overlooking the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, it was like a park, the way he
manicured this entire estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had, he had so much money, people,
his nickname was the Pharaoh because he
[SPEAKER_00]: had so much money.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so he introduces me to Arjan,
the guy who ran the greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam from strain hunters,
strain hunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arjan and I become really good friends
and he loves the operation I have going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we start doing these genetics
exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with what is available in
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy named Mean Gene Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who had, uh, you know, some serious
genetics at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you know, we're seeing early skunk
varieties, uh, quite unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he came up with, you know,
he's famous for Hayes varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and some really interesting sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hits me up and says, look, I've got,
this is the, this is the best strains I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to kind of cross them with what
you've got and let's, let's produce some
[SPEAKER_00]: really unique strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started doing that and I had some
outside growers who would, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: would see huge amounts of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm ending up with pounds and pounds
and pounds of seeds, uh, over a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys, these, these varieties are
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole, uh, one branch of it was all
sitting in citrus, like lemon,
[SPEAKER_00]: so lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like someone put a lemon right
under your nose, orange, just like an
[SPEAKER_00]: orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was this really,
really skunk diesel-y branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they were kind of like expressed
in those two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were either this really citrus form
or they were this incredible diesel-y
[SPEAKER_00]: indica, uh, uh, group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just, I mean, these were
really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even by today's standards,
I would say, um, this was like 1979,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still right around the first year when
you were setting up the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, I am collecting all these
seeds and, you know, at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: where is, uh, cannabis being grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being grown in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want to commercialize,
if you want to commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you either go out into the woods and do
this gorilla thing, which never made sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to me because they got helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get caught, you know,
they're throwing away the key,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause at that time, you know,
cannabis wasn't that distant from heroin,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the way they looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it was a very serious offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a major felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so that never made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm going to go out and risk a giant
crop outside and hopefully it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the helicopters don't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started thinking, where can I grow
weed commercially at scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want to see these varieties grown
at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this friend who was smuggling,
uh, from Mexico on the border in El Paso,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, El Paso and Juarez being sister cities
that are separated by a bridge over the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rio Grande.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually knew him through this guy
named Lloyd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he was a surfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a boutique clothing store in Laguna
beach called visions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sold all these like white flowing
hippie clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, it was really classic for
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down the street from that was,
uh, the brotherhood of eternal loves head
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you would go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the coolest place cause they
had all this stuff oriented to
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in there and next door to it was a
record store that sold only, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: bootleg albums.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go in there, Dylan on the Isle of
white, Janice Joplin performing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in there and grab all these great
albums that, you know, they were more
[SPEAKER_00]: great quality, but they were really cool
concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so he was kind of in the middle of
that and he, he knew my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use a fake name here,
Brian, uh, in El Paso.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where he was getting the weed
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy would ship weed out to California
and Lloyd would sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was in, they were doing tons of
weed, tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so the entire weed scene was being
fueled by these Mexican varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were very poor quality, you know,
sticks stems and not really brick weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, just not kind of sewer grade
weed compared to what we could grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, indoors or, or even outdoors in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I don't know how it happened,
but I just got this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pitch to this guy,
you know, I pitched it to Lloyd first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, look, um, what if we gave
these genetics or made these genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the Mexican cartels that are
growing in Mexico?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could grow this at commercial scale and
the quality would benefit everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would benefit the Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd get a higher price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would benefit the consumers because
we'd get quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a win-win for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lloyd thought about that and he's all,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pitch it to my buddy in El Paso.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, get some samples of your weed
and let's fly down to El Paso and pitch
[SPEAKER_00]: this to the cartels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, Lloyd just kind of
handed me off to Brian and Brian and I
[SPEAKER_00]: became the best of friends and he's
actually my best, one of my best friends
[SPEAKER_00]: to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so we go, I fly down to El Paso
and I'm looking out the window of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plane as we're flying down and it looks
like this scrub brush that you'd see in
[SPEAKER_00]: California deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's all these little roads cut
through there and I start thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, you could just easily get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smuggle it across the border a
variety of ways, either in backpacks or in
[SPEAKER_00]: cars where they jet across.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all these different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking at the plane,
I began to see, oh, wow, this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting how they can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and his wife, uh, I'm going to use
a fake name, Malia, picked me up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's driving a classically restored 1960
Cadillac convertible pink with a white
[SPEAKER_00]: interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've transformed this car into a,
the most advanced sound system I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being in a concert hall and she
has speakers hidden in every event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see a speaker anywhere,
but we get in the car and it's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: rock and roll city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're driving with a top down and I've
got some samples with me that I matched
[SPEAKER_00]: smuggled on the painter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did sealed bags, foil bags, and,
uh, no smell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smuggled it all the way here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got these branches like about this
long smuggling to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first I got to get to El Paso.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might've been one of the first people to
ever do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smuggling cannabis to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be, um, so I've got these
beautiful specimens and I have some
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolled joints also in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Malia is a big smoker and she's,
Oh, we love California homegrown down here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I passed with the front seat and
she tells me, honey, you and I are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be new best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, look, um, I've got probably about
eight ounces with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably have half of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll, we'll make do with the four
ounces we have for a show and tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, Oh honey, we'll smoke that
in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so California weed was much
appreciated in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're driving, you know, in this
Cadillac and she puts on the Bobby Fuller
[SPEAKER_00]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the law and the law one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just thinking, you know,
man, this just frames the trip so
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was later to understand that Bobby
Fuller was a son of El Paso and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a local band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, I fought the law and
the law one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am with all this weed in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we drive to their house and the men
talk, she leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, by the way, let me just tell you one
thing about in any given moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: she's wearing a quarter million dollars to
her house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So half a million dollars of native
American jewelry, uh, diamonds,
[SPEAKER_00]: just decked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it reminded me of one of those
African tribes where they stack all those
[SPEAKER_00]: rings up on your neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she was just decked in all this
jewelry, uh, Rolex watches you've never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen custom made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and she would compliment this just
with a silk blouse and Wrangler jeans and
[SPEAKER_00]: cowboy boots, but like quarter million
dollars, a half a million dollars of
[SPEAKER_00]: native American custom jewelry of various
kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Americans didn't get a quarter million
dollars though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually she had these artists that
she supported in, in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: She paid them well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so these people are flying high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they'd been doing tons over the
border for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I sit down, uh, with Brian and
he says, okay, I've made some
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make a pitch today to the
head of the Juarez cartel, a guy named
[SPEAKER_00]: Granius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granius in Spanish means mophead kind of,
I mean, that's the best translation I can
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he had these sort of reggae styled
locks, you know, that warranted the
[SPEAKER_00]: nickname and he had started out as a,
uh, he had gone to school in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, sold cars, had some business
education in the United States and went
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Juarez and became the cartel king
bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to fully understand that the
person who they put in that position
[SPEAKER_00]: behind them are the Mexican government,
the highest levels of the Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: government, the richest families in
Mexico, and they put this person in place
[SPEAKER_00]: who acts as an intermediary and is sort of
easy, easily expendable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any kind of trouble,
you know, they put another guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: interfaces with the gringos and does the
major brokering to those people,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, on the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a job where you're expendable,
but at this point he, his wealth is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing and he is driving around town
in bulletproof rolls, Royces, and building
[SPEAKER_00]: high rise apartments and clubs in downtown
Juarez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this time, you know, now we know
Juarez is kind of the murder capital of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and people getting disappeared
and all this cartel violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I should say, and the
reason I wasn't totally afraid to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff is that cartels operated
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They operated on principles of honor and,
you know, they would rather bribe you than
[SPEAKER_00]: kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, you know, killing someone was
a big deal at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the bloody enterprise that it
later became.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, he's establishing
himself and, you know, these guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things I learned was they love
quarter horse racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the feast of Santa, Santa
Ventura, uh, the feast of Buena Ventura,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took over this town and they had
these cartel quarter horse races and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he bet a million dollars on his horse
to win and he lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shrugged it off, you know,
like no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, he, he was an up and
coming figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go meet with Granius,
show him my incredibly beautiful purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, weed you've never seen in Mexico
glistening with resin, just gorgeous.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really strong smelling skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so, uh, Brian tells me,
okay, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get in his Mercedes and we're
driving to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on my way to meet the head of the
Juarez cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, still in Texas at this point driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I, I didn't know at this time
that Brian was kind of a joker,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so he says, okay, I hope you
have that well hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just about to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive through customs, Mexican customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get all nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have it hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just sail right through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, yeah, go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody's looking for weed coming
into Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we drive through Juarez.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we drive through Juarez and we come to
this residential area, uh, beautiful kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cul-de-sac and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a normal looking tracked house,
but it has this giant water tower in the
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all these cartel soldiers
walking around in front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them Sicarios, essentially
assassins soldiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's a kind of a cultural
thing in Mexico to be, uh, a person like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these guys wearing suits and
sunglasses and carrying AK-47s just right
[SPEAKER_00]: out there in the open in the middle of
this cul-de-sac.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get out of the car and they're
talking on radios, ushering us in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go into this water tower and,
uh, there's a downstairs and an upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so downstairs is kind of ring of
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I'm ushered in into sitting next
to this guy who is dressed like a very
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional campesino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I recognize that having done a lot
of field work among the Mayans,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize that he's in very traditional
Mayan attire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he has this hat with these little
dangles all around the brim, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to keep supernatural,
uh, forces away from like bad luck and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, any kind of supernatural
intervention, uh, away from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's all dressed in white and that's
who I ended up sitting down next to this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got my bag with the small
branches in it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I start talking to this guy and
I'm talking to him in Spanish,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I use a little Mayan too, just to show
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he recognizes, you know, he's,
he's Mayan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, how does this guy know any
Mayan?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he starts kind of warming up and we're
chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find out, meanwhile, there's a
stairway going up to the top of this water
[SPEAKER_00]: tower and they're bringing in U-Haul
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these people are bringing in U-Haul
boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian leans over to me and says,
those boxes are full of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the counting house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing all the money upstairs to
be counted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this is happening while I'm
talking to the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, during the course of the
conversation, I find out that he is in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact, Mr. Biggs in charge of Mr. Biggs'
rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the guy who's the agricultural
master for all the weed they're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, you know, I'm a bit of a
cultivator myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brian had introduced me as a maestro,
profesor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said I was a professor, university
professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of how I was introduced
to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's, that's a position of real
respect in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's, you know, speaking very
respectfully to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know, I'm, I'm a bit of a
cannabis cultivator myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to myself, well, now's the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually had opened these foil
sealed bags and I had them hand closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I opened them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I think I have something I want to
show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I opened it up and I pull out one of
these branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole room fills up with skunk smell
and everybody turns around and looks at me
[SPEAKER_00]: and looks at what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you've got cartel soldiers
taking their sunglasses off like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looks at it and his eyes get as big
as saucers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he composes himself and he says,
señor, una momento, por favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, and he says, can I have a branch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he walks upstairs, waves off the
guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They part for, you know, let him by and he
goes upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden I hear all the
shuffling upstairs and movement and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like swearing peachy this and
fuck this and chingato madre and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he comes walking back downstairs and
he's like, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm escorted past the guards to the
administrative offices of the War as
[SPEAKER_00]: cartel and grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm up there and he's got this
giant antique desk and he's pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got garbage bags full and he's
looking through these bags and he's pissed
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a peachy buds, peachy marijuana,
you know, and basically what I'm coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand is he is upset because he
believes that some of his pot is equal to
[SPEAKER_00]: my pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's trying to find a representative
bud, you know, to show that he can go just
[SPEAKER_00]: as good as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going through these bags and he's
all upset like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he finally comes up with like a bud,
like about like this big, my buds are like
[SPEAKER_00]: this big giant fucking indica buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he holds it up next to see just as
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we're all, there's a moment
of silence where everybody in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledges that they're not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, his little tiny bud,
you know, everything's machismo in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an innuendo, sexual innuendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: My big one is better than his little one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kind of suddenly there's a
moment where he kind of realizes that and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's kind of kind of calms down and he's
like, OK, but there's a few more peachy
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck your buds, you know, a few more of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he sits down and he puts his feet up
on the desk and he says, OK, let's have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's wearing this starched white
shirt, white hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a style of dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the Sinaloa style,
big old belt buckle with a Mexican gold
[SPEAKER_00]: coin in the middle of it, stitched boots,
crisp white shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've got this whole way of
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's sitting down at his desk with his
feet up and he reaches into his shirt
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket and he pulls out a little baggie
and it's filled with base, Coke base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pours it out on the table and he
takes out a package of Marlboro cigarettes
[SPEAKER_00]: and carefully undoes the cigarettes,
takes the tobacco out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like a little flaccid
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mixes tobacco with the base and he
starts putting it, stuffing it back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the Marlboro's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sits back and lights up and
he's just smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cigarette after cigarette of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, how is this guy even mildly
coherent?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's just smoking all this base
while we're having this chat.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he says, OK, I like what you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, I have seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a new process called
cloning that we can use to even accelerate
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of viable plants that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, oh, yeah, tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of tell him about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, as time goes on during
the discussion, he starts becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes over to a file cabinet and
pulls the file cabinet open, takes a file
[SPEAKER_00]: folder out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, let me show you where you're
going to be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lays these Polaroid pictures out on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at these Polaroids and vast
lime green fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: On white desert sand, just as far as the
eye can see, you know, just huge giant
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, oh, wow, this is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I noticed in the
photographs is there's Mexican Army
[SPEAKER_00]: guarding these fields, Mexican Army half
tracks, Mexican Army helicopter,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican Army soldiers with machine guns
guarding these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is going on, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say to him, Quesesto, he said,
ah, we buy the Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a relationship with the Minister
of Defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he takes out our competitors fields
and we pay him and he takes care of our
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, wow, this is like wired to
the highest levels of government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's why, to some extent,
getting the story out there, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if the Mexican government would look
favorably on me telling this story,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says, OK, this is the stories from
50 years ago already or 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this has come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone in current government
is going to care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says, OK, this is how it's going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a percentage of the
load.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be able to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do all the crossing of the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will ship it to your markets in New
York in commercial vehicles and to San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have markets in San Francisco and New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of one stop shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring the genetics and I bring the
market, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he says, huh, this is this is very
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'll give you a percentage
and just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring me those fucking Samia's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want those fucking Samia's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you fuck me on this and you
work with anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cut your balls off and feed them to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we drive away from this meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I've got it made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's going to handle everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I got to do is impart some cultivation
knowledge, supervise the grow and supply
[SPEAKER_00]: all the seeds and clones and set up a
cloning operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out he wanted help with all
aspects of his smuggling operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I got I'm having trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to make sure it doesn't
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got I want to make sure that,
you know, there's no smell in the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I found these packaging machines,
you know, for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place in San Rafael does
industrial, you know, sealed bagging,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and injects nitrogen into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, was unusual then, not so unusual
now, but injects nitrogen into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it prevents mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go away from this thinking,
man, I have got it made, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we start scaling up and I start
going over to Mexico and come to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that these seeds and clones are
going to the cartels operation called
[SPEAKER_00]: Rancho Buffalo, which is a giant
plantation in Chihuahua, hundreds and
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of acres, thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just funneling all my stuff down
there and they're like, hey, we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we know that, you know,
about fertilizer and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, you know, instruct us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to all this trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in the interim,
he says, look, I'll ship you the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've got now just to get the pipeline
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, I had, you know,
significant connections to get back east
[SPEAKER_00]: with as I explained through Richard and
through all these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, let's open the pipeline up
and I'll ship to your buyers in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll ship you the best of what I have
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some lime green, mishwakan, you know,
and we'll get that up to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bifocal Bob is even impressed with
what I'm sending at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the first scum buds start showing
up and they're neatly packaged in these
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes, cardboard boxes that are lined with
plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have the perfect tops all laid
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed them how to manicure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're producing outstanding wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regular quality Mexican selling for
about four or 500 bucks, 400 bucks a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time it gets to New York,
it's 800 bucks, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're selling these in New York for 14
and people are falling over themselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are falling over themselves to
pay whatever is probably going out of 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: to the minor wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are so many hands that goes
through in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's crazy the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dropped this load out with two
Bifocal Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stages us, as I told you, in
Westchester County at the Howard Johnson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come in to his Manhattan
warehouse, pull right in and unload like
[SPEAKER_00]: four tons of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets packaged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later that night, I'm staying in a
nice hotel next to the Golden Gate Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm walking outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy comes up and he's like,
weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Helmsley Central Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy comes up to me, he's like,
weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me see what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shows me the weed I just brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the matter of like less than 24
hours, every bit that I brought was
[SPEAKER_00]: already on the street, already being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is quite a markup between,
you know, boxes of weed and little tiny,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, half, you know, joint size,
eighths, whatever they're selling on the
[SPEAKER_00]: street for, you know, there's quite a
markup by the time it gets down to that
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New Yorkers have no problem paying it,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was $25, $35 for like a couple
of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like really expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But New Yorkers were sent to a little dime
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In his pocket, you know, and he's got a
whole pocket full of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like right next to him are,
you know, it's like this whole marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: walking along the street in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these prostitutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, hey, you want a good time,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like this whole red light
district right next to the finest hotels,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things are working pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm spending a lot of time in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to all the best music
in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a jazz aficionado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm seeing the most notable people in
jazz night after night.
[SPEAKER_00]: My routine was wake up, go for a jog in
New York, in Golden Gate Park,
[SPEAKER_00]: come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck Central Park, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go for a jog in Central Park,
come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: By any chance, were you jogging around
Sheep's Meadow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still the spot today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sheep's Meadow is a famous location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just loving this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for lunch, I'm going to like some
of the best restaurants in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I go to this place, Il Molino,
and it's in the village.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks just like a storefront,
you know, and I go in there and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best Italian food I've ever had in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring around, you know, this cart
with smoked mussels and tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: little crust, crust of bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the owner comes out and he's all
decked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I'm making little sandwiches out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, where did you learn to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, that's just the way we do it
where I'm from in Rome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we become friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's given me olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to this place at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mafia hangout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And limousines are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're bringing the girlfriends on
Friday night and the wives on Saturday
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's straight out of Goodfellas,
you know, so I'm connected with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this, you know, music, everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a call from Brian in El Paso.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's real somber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, get a copy of the El Paso Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, where am I going to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get a copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew at the public library,
New York Public Library, they have like
[SPEAKER_00]: every paper in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a cab, I go to the New York
Public Library and I find the El Paso
[SPEAKER_00]: Times and there's a headline on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I thought I was going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear the text was like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the whole first half of the paper,
the whole above the fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows a guy and he's tied up in a
chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a bag over his head, artist
rendering of a guy, not a photograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, I thought I was going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start reading this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy went, it's my guy,
Granius, who picked him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to take photographs and notes of
the new high rise building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building that Granius was building in
downtown Juarez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Granius, smoking all this base,
he looks out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, go get that guy and bring him up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why he's taking pictures and
writing notes about my building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the henchmen bring him up there and
they beat him up, put a bag over his head,
[SPEAKER_00]: scare the shit out of him, take his
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then today they would have just killed
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then they took him out and they just
left him in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wandered back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a reporter for the El Paso Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were doing a story on Granius,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly this becomes an international
incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bush stops the traffic across the border
right then and there, declares the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: war like a new drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm fond of saying my friends and I
started the drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every car that's coming across is
getting checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: leans on the Mexican government and says,
pick this guy up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they pick him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm reading all this and I'm freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I call Brian and he says, it's not as
bad as you might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it just moves us up the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to have a meeting with the
head of the Guadalajara cartel,
[SPEAKER_00]: Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and Rafael
Caro Quintero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys who were depicted in Narcos,
Mexico, if you've seen that series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gallardo was... And if you haven't,
you'll need to sort of follow some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That series is quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about... No, fortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I get to tell my own story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of kept it... I was an asset
that they kind of kept hushed up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Brian tells me, look, catch the
next plane back to El Paso.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go meet with Gallardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've moved up the chain
and everything's just going to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wow, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I fly back and we try to drive way
out into the middle of the... People ask
[SPEAKER_00]: me that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, I was treated like
an asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a very special, highly regarded
asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would protect me all kinds of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started going with Granius,
we got this call and he says, meet my
[SPEAKER_00]: lieutenant who's in charge of security in
Juarez before you come to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was when I was demonstrating the
packaging machines, how to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a setup in the driveway of some
tract house in Juarez and we were bagging
[SPEAKER_00]: up bales of alfalfa to demonstrate to his
crew how to work these packaging machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, before you do that,
stop and see my head of security,
[SPEAKER_00]: Paco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I go to meet Paco and this guy is
like huge guy, jail tattoos, obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: done serious time in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go to his house and we go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, sit down, you know, in his living
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got like 20 bolts on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close this, chain this, another dead bolt
here, another dead bolt here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what is this guy expecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, look, the boss wants you to
have this identification while you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It identifies you as Mexican narcotics
police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he whipped out this identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my picture, badge, everything,
paperwork, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am suddenly an officer in the DFS,
one of the most feared police agencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, present this identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what the situation is,
you're in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, does it make any difference
that my Spanish might not be exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect or there's an accident?
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them, he like laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that makes any difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it make any difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had blonde hair then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't look Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're Mexican narcotics, judicial police,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want anything to happen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, it gave me maybe a false sense of
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get back to, we're driving out into
the desert in Chihuahua and we hit this
[SPEAKER_00]: ranch, Rancho Las Palmas out in the middle
of nowhere, drive up this dirt road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a, you know, these guys
sitting around listening to Narco
[SPEAKER_00]: Traficantes, I don't know if you're
familiar with those, but they're a Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: Banda style of music that celebrates the
activities of Narco Traficantes or drug
[SPEAKER_00]: traffickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, their wins and,
you know, they're basically celebrated as
[SPEAKER_00]: heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act as Robin Hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they like hold these big
festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give people money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your kid is sick, you go to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you some, you know, make sure
that he gets taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically revered, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are listening to these
ballads and there's a shrine to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I'm drawing a blank on the name
of the saint, but it's the Narco Saint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pray to this guy for success in
drug trafficking, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little shrine set up to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hey, so smell better day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, they've got playing on the boom
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my three animals, referring to the
three contraband drugs of the Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics supply, cocaine, marijuana,
and heroin performed by Tijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Lord of the skies, referring to a
model by the singers, the goats horn,
[SPEAKER_00]: a song about the goats horn that's slang
for an AK 47 rifle by Los Johannes del
[SPEAKER_00]: Norte.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm listening to this music and I look
around, there's the shrine to Jesus
[SPEAKER_00]: Malverde.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the also considered the angel of
the poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he, he, he was like a Robin Hood
figure who stole from the rich and gay to
[SPEAKER_00]: the poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's actually venerated by Roman
Catholics and it became a part of his
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's associated with protection and
miracles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically for those involved in
illicit activities, his grave and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Culiacan is attended by thousands who like
candles and there's also all these
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, hey, so smell better day shrines
throughout Mexico and in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked over and lit a candle,
you know, I was like, might as well make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, you know, at all levels of things
are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm lighting a candle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there with Brian and his Mexican
partner, Charlie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brian says, Hey, look off in the
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this like little crowd cloud of
dust off in the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it starts coming toward us,
I see it's an entourage of like 10 black
[SPEAKER_00]: SUVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell what kind of model,
but these black SUVs are driving up all 11
[SPEAKER_00]: drive-up next to the house here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they form like a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then driving into the middle is the,
the SUV with the boss of bosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: El Pedrino De Los Padrinos, Miguel
Guiardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he steps out of the car and he's
dressed in the Savile Row suit,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the head of a Fortune 500 company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got, you know, gold cufflinks,
gold roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he is decked, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he, he nods to me,
shakes my hand, but he has a lawyer who
[SPEAKER_00]: translates, even though I speak Spanish,
he's, he's got a lawyer who does his
[SPEAKER_00]: translating and he kind of acts as a
buffer in discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you know, just that we,
we start the conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, uh, Senor Guiardo appreciates all
the excellent work you're doing on our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to continue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I can tell you the whole
history of Guiardo, but we don't have time
[SPEAKER_00]: for that right now, but at some point,
you know, he's a very interesting figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so we're chatting and the lawyer
says to me, you know, because of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your excellent work,
uh, Senor Guiardo knows that you also have
[SPEAKER_00]: a background in chemistry and chemical
process engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would like to ask you if you would
do a favor for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all, you know, anything for,
for Senor Guiardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, um, we are receiving cocaine
from Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very poor quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and we need to process it into a much
higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Senor Guiardo wants to create a
facility to do this in Durango,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and a very large scale facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you could help us
design, uh, build and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: show us how to operate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm sitting there thinking
to myself, I mean, there's one other
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that Senor Guiardo would like your
assistance with, you know, and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts are racing through my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just came here to fucking grow
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not come here to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I knew that Felix Guiardo is not
someone who would take being turned down
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was kind of my opportunity to
kind of close the deal on my value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought to myself, I could walk away
from the project before it attracts
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just show them how to, you know,
put SOPs in place and just set it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stood up and I held out my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Senor Guiardo, I'm at your
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I built the large just cocaine
reprocessing plant imaginable in Durango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there's some great stories there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot about cocaine and the
various species of coca from which the
[SPEAKER_00]: extract is derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are only two of 17 species that
are successfully cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there's one particular that is
desirable cause it has to how high is the
[SPEAKER_00]: alkaloid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could go into, you know,
a real disquisition on cocaine by botany
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's harvested by podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to tell you all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but this facility he had selected was
on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got skirts of Durango and several
large industrial buildings that had a
[SPEAKER_00]: large mess hall, multi-story building,
uh, that was the designated location for
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial laboratory and a small army
of his most trusted employees provided
[SPEAKER_00]: security along with multiple payoffs to
the Mexican army, police agencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, Durango is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the capital city, uh, of the state of
Durango and it's located in this dusty dry
[SPEAKER_00]: region, uh, in the Sierra Madre,
Occidental, uh, mountain range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's, it's beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, some of it, uh, and it has
always been an area known for,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, its resistance to authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and perhaps that's why they picked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has a long history in the
Mexican war of independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, there's, uh, you know,
Perfurio Diaz and the Peronza had strong
[SPEAKER_00]: ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolutionary leaders had strong ties to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so when I saw the laboratory that he
proposed, I made a huge list of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to need that he would get from
his German suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I became acquainted with
the fact that he had these German
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers, kind of like in Breaking Bad,
where they, they showed these,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, German suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had all these businesses that were
agricultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether you know it or not,
a lot of the same chemicals that are used,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, are used to make pesticides,
the precursor chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an easy process of layering
purchase of these chemicals so that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: could figure out what it was being used
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I started, you know, listing,
you know, dozens of high volume rural
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporators, giant custom glass vessels,
grinders, pulverizers, mixing tanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I developed the operating procedures
that would look at the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out, you know, what would be the
next steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it had to be cleaned up before you
could even reconstitute it because
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually I would reconstitute it back
into base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually the final product was
essentially pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there is one thing I will tell you
about, um, when in the process you add
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrochloric acid to precipitate the
cocaine out of solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you add it too quickly,
it turns into a dull powder, boom,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you swirl, and I started doing this
like in Erlenmeyer flasks to figure it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and then scale it to giant size,
but you swirl the Erlenmeyer and you swirl
[SPEAKER_00]: the other Erlenmeyer with the acid
solution in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you slowly pour them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns into the most beautiful flake,
this iridescent snow flakes appear and
[SPEAKER_00]: they layer up, uh, different from the dull
dusty powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just pour it in and the reaction
takes place too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was actually quite revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I set up these giant vessels that
would titrate in the acid solution slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to create this beautiful
pharmaceutical grade cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I hate doing a bad job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, this story has some
twists and turns and we've kind of started
[SPEAKER_00]: a thread here and I'll just take it to a
certain place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, while in there, you know, uh,
fumes, everything, there's a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: really funny things that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is I had this guy working for
me, uh, who he, I kept telling him there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a water heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, before we start anything,
turn the pilot light off on that water
[SPEAKER_00]: heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have any flames in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the pilot light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want it on in the same
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I had this chemical feed from
upstairs and this guy had used tubing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong tubing to construct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was tubing that wasn't rated for
acetone, which I used as a solvent and
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tubing started swelling and
getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the guy left the uh,
pilot light on and the tubing swelled into
[SPEAKER_00]: this giant, uh, expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy walks over there and goes,
KSS though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pokes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It explodes, pours all the solvent out in
the floor, head straight over to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the pilot light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly I've got giant flames in front of
me, uh, you know, 30 feet high in this
[SPEAKER_00]: giant industrial building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's connected to hundreds of 55 gallon
drums of solvent that are on the second
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's starting to burn up the,
uh, the tubing to the second floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed the first fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see, I try to put it out and the fire
extinguisher doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, he gets me and we go outside
and he says, man, we just got to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: away, you know, just let the thing blow
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, nothing's blowing up on my
watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go back in there and this is what's
really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had been working with Alexander
Shulgin, when I had successfully done some
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis processes, he gave me this fire
extinguisher, which was like this big four
[SPEAKER_00]: foot tall fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, this is your symbol of you having
graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now an underground chemist and I
give this to you to have in all your
[SPEAKER_00]: underground chemistry labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought the thing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had it there sitting in a corner and
it hadn't been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't even looked at it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw it and here are these flames are
getting out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over, pulled the pin on it,
turned it toward the fire and the force of
[SPEAKER_00]: it was knocked me over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost the fire was out in seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who what, so Shulgin saved my ass
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the guy who was, you know,
watching this disappear into Durango,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw him again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he was just like, what are the
repercussions from this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It messed up maybe, you know, a kilo of
Coke or something, nothing serious,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'm in a, uh, a, um, a pharmacy in
Durango because I had a headache,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, from everything that had happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at headache tablets you
can buy over the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I come across is, uh,
something they sell over the counter in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico called co-fall or got Amina,
which is essentially aspirin with or got
[SPEAKER_00]: to mean tartrate or got to mean tartrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know, is a vasoconstrictor
that constricts your blood vessels like
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reduces headache pain and,
you know, coupled with that aspirin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you have a, a pretty
effective headache medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I knew that or got to mean tartrate
was also the main precursor for LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is impossible to get, you know,
you even ask about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it was so restricted,
unbelievably restricted because that was
[SPEAKER_00]: what you needed at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the synthesis route that
everybody used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to my cartel friends and I
said, Hey, by the way, could you get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's 55 gallon drums of this
sitting around somewhere where they
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys think you could get me that
chemical?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, of course we can get it
for you and we can get that for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: any other precursor chemicals that you
might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an idea started forming in my P brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these guys can get me all the,
the precursor chemicals I need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, that sounds like a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll redirect the cartel a
little bit away from cocaine and towards
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I set about acquiring those
precursor chemicals and this was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started acquiring more and more
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I told them, look, I need to get a huge
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I calculated what I would need for
everyone in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I multiplied it times four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had enough precursor chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as much as you might think
because it's quite concentrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still quite a bit and started to
assemble enough LSD chemicals for everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world four times over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I resolved, I, you know, there's a lot
of lab technique involved with making LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you may see on the street,
oftentimes is a soup of isomers that have
[SPEAKER_00]: a very unfocused effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not LSD 25, which requires several
purification steps that are occasionally
[SPEAKER_00]: omitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I resolved, I'm going to make the best
LSD anybody's ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, you know, I grew up on it on
house Lee LSD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so assemble all this, smuggle it
across the border and using again,
[SPEAKER_00]: old man, George, and part of his crew,
one of his friends who was a tugboat
[SPEAKER_00]: captain in New York, they drive it all the
way up to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find a storage facility at the
airport in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually had, um, um, you know,
it was like a double size, huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge storage facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I started stocking all these
chemicals in there and I set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory state of the art laboratory,
and I started making proof of concept
[SPEAKER_00]: batches, uh, make it, you know,
trying to make the best LSD I could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I figured I I'd store it in,
in thermal, uh, containers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: packed with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there would be no degradation and I
bury, you know, I'd make it, make it,
[SPEAKER_00]: make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bury a whole bunch and then I
would just pull out what I needed over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I buried in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had this whole plan,
you know, of how I was going to supply LSD
[SPEAKER_00]: to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was still thinking at
that time that LSD would fuel a social
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just what America needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so now, now I'm, I'm starting to make
these batches and it's coming out really,
[SPEAKER_00]: good, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I'm just going to take this
up story up to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had a friend who was working with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually the guy who I had worked
with on the mushroom project who watered
[SPEAKER_00]: my mushrooms for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't extremely knowledgeable,
but he thought I needed a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical that I didn't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went to the East Bay to a chemical
supply house in the East Bay to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical supply house was a DEA sting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had been set up to catch people
trying to acquire methamphetamine
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got this and they, he used fake ID
to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that set off a red flag, even though
they hadn't been looking for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they followed him and he took his
chemical back to my storage facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they followed him back to my storage
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was, you know, several days
later, I went to check on the chemicals in
[SPEAKER_00]: the storage facility and they were all
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend, I was calling him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's nowhere to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that the only thing in the
storage is a post-it note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, this is the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm sitting there thinking,
well, if I have to assume that they know
[SPEAKER_00]: me or, you know, that they've investigated
enough to trace this to me, I just assume
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, I'm either going on the run
right now with whatever money I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was rolling pretty good at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either go on the run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I lawyer up and go talk to these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the best lawyers in San Francisco
and went to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, I met them at, uh,
the, a lot, one of the law offices of one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lawyers I had, I had like two of
the best lawyers in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't mention their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've since, uh, both passed on,
uh, really great guys, incredible,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was, uh, former federal
prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's whose office I met at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm sitting there waiting and this
crew shows up from the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, you know, a tax guy,
a, you know, a D, a couple of DEA agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are super low level and
they're like astonished.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea what to do with any of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, one of the guys that's with them
is this asshole, uh, who, who starts
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to tell me that, you know,
you're going to jail for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to see the light of
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually started pacing off the
dimensions of the cell that I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in, uh, just to show me how big the
cell was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, you know, this group was
suddenly another group showed up and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were superseded by a much larger group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group was composed of a judge,
top level DEA, FBI, alcohol, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: and firearms, justice department people,
and it was led by a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they needed a search warrant,
they had a judge in tow that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: just write a search warrant if they wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's this high level group and they
lean in and the other group leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: they said, well, we have done some
research on who you are and we think you
[SPEAKER_00]: can help us with a very complex,
difficult situation that we're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a guy on the border that you
know, he's the nephew of Rafael Talavera,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a cartel figure, and, uh,
he's a psychopathic killer and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: killing all these people on the border,
starting cycles of revenge where hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of people are killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, he is being tried in
absentia in the United States and a border
[SPEAKER_00]: patrol agent is testifying against him.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's made a threat on that border
patrol agent's life and his family and
[SPEAKER_00]: other people in the office in El Paso.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take these threats very seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is a menace.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a psychopathic killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I knew the guy really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I knew his uncle even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in fact, I had worked with him and he
had used our warehouse on occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, I said, well, you know,
first of all, they said, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to confirm that you're looking at
50 years to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no getting around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they said, but, you know,
you know this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, yeah, I know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what can I possibly do to help?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the judge who was kind of leading
the discussion leans forward in his chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's dressed like, uh, you know,
white hat, belt buckle, like a Texas
[SPEAKER_00]: ranger leans forward in his creaky chair
and says, well, Dale, we'd like you to
[SPEAKER_00]: kidnap him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So got my posse together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kidnapped him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to go into that more next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a wonderful story so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't just cliff hang it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta, we gotta come back and try to
finish some of these stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's, um, I will tell you that the
story gets much crazier from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're writing a book, I assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished it and I'm actually
working with an editor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping for a release in spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I'm toying with all these
different titles in my wife favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I always say that it was a different
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, subtitle chronicles of a psychedelic
pioneer and the rain of the cartels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, sits in my editor said,
look, you have all these other stories
[SPEAKER_00]: that didn't make it into the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and write those stories up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She started reading those stories and
she's like, God, we got to put these in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the book is going to be much larger
and I'm going to filter in all these
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other stories, uh, which are
independently, equally hair raising and
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, thrilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I want, I want you guys to
understand that, you know, getting weed
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't what it was today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you didn't go to a dispensary
and buy an eighth of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You imported it from Columbia,
from Thailand and each one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: places, the name would elicit all these
notions of quality and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: style and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was like kind of a
international supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that environment, you know,
there was also psychedelics, cocaine a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit here and there, not quite as
much, but primarily cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, a lot of it was
centered in the Bay area, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the earliest Thai weed kind of came in
through the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some good stories there as
well, but you know, pretty much I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: an 11 o'clock so maybe we should stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: One.
Okay.
