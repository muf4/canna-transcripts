[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Gabby Staten Island here on the
Craft Growers Network and I wanted to take
[SPEAKER_00]: this opportunity to share a little bit of
my story and thoughts for the new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something until now only friends
of mine knew about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017 Sonoma County was ravaged by a
terrible fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time my daughter Lily was three
weeks old.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fiance Leah had postpartum
preeclampsia, which is quite dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police pounded on our door at 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: telling us we needed to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left with nothing but a diaper bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left cash, pounds of flour,
my entire collection of seeds I had made
[SPEAKER_00]: and saved, and all of our belongings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left with slippers, no shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even left my wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we were leaving as a
precaution, but we didn't believe our
[SPEAKER_00]: house would burn down and we would lose
everything, which we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a hotel with help from someone in
line at a hotel because we had no cash or
[SPEAKER_00]: a wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That morning we awoke to the reality that
we had lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben from IC Collective sent someone over
to our hotel with a giant bag of weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, a dab rig, and a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A landlord put us up in his home and he
moved out into his mother's so we could
[SPEAKER_00]: have a place to live, and all of our
friends and family showed love and
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought us food and so much clothes
was donated to us since we literally left
[SPEAKER_00]: with the clothes on our back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the worst things that ever
happened to me, but in this terrible time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw how much we were really loved by our
friends and family, and it continued to
[SPEAKER_00]: give us strength to continue on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years later, tragedy hit us again.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grocery shop burned to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of a faulty plug that had nothing
plugged into it besides a Wi-Fi router.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fires got us again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The accumulation of all these events spun
me into a deep depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very dark time for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember sleeping in my dusty,
dirty van one night because Leah and I
[SPEAKER_00]: were fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cold, I had no blankets,
and I was truly wishing I was dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew I couldn't leave my family like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pushed on, started working at commercial
farms, as cultivation director,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was the first time I had a job in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was just lucky to have an income so
I could support my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still suffering from depression and
did not know how to relieve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think it was 2021 that Leah and I went to
a concert at the Mystic Theater in
[SPEAKER_00]: Petaluma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That concert saved my life from a life of
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The artist was Mike Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: His music was beautiful and his message
was so powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this one song titled Be
Thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to read to you a little bit
of the lyrics right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be thankful for whatever you got,
because you better be sure that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: ungrateful, because this life is a gift,
and the more you receive should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: more that you give.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many contemplating whether a cup is
half empty or the cup is half full is just
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my brother, why you wearing that
frown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the system been cheating you,
beating you, and holding you down?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've lost sight of everything that you
stood for, and now you're caught up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: glamour and they've got you wanting more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of their illusionist, hypnotist,
polytrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got you on a puppet string dangling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to see how long it's been,
we've been held captive as prisoners in
[SPEAKER_00]: our very own skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But listen up, my brethren, because my
brother and my friend, just when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that things couldn't get no worse,
remember that the last shall be the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be thankful for whatever you got,
because you've got to be sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not ungrateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna put a link in the description,
and I hope you guys will listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This song and Mike Love's music changed my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed my complete outlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me realize how lucky and how
blessed I am to have the most beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the most amazing friends,
and I live in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make an effort to remind myself every
day how lucky I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell my family and my friends how much I
love and appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now to more current times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was invited to a group on Reddit by
Cosmic, who's now a regular co-host on the
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some friends there, including Wolf,
who's also a co-host on the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so grateful for these guys,
and I try to tell them every time we talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cosmic, he's the one that encouraged me to
just make the first podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered to help, and he recorded it for
me on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also taught himself to do Maristem
tissue culture and has inspired me to
[SPEAKER_00]: restart my tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find him at Cosmic Strains
official on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wolf, he reminds me of Notzodog in all the
best ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's soft spoken and so intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing for four years,
but has been so immersed in education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he's more knowledgeable than
many people growing for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning from him every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most important, he's been a great
friend that I can lean on and ask advice
[SPEAKER_00]: and get honest responses from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find him on Instagram at
MrWolfGrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sasha, I met Sasha I think about eight
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He messaged me on Instagram telling me he
enjoyed one of the podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started talking, and I was not only
immediately intrigued by his nursery and
[SPEAKER_00]: what growing in Australia and Slovenia was
like, but I was also amazed by how similar
[SPEAKER_00]: our lives were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made an immediate connection,
and we talked almost every day for
[SPEAKER_00]: extended periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell you how to find Sasha on
Instagram, but his Instagram handle is
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like Quality Grow Shops,
Ebertics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get him the Slovenian Hobbit
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I'll just tell you I'll put
his Instagram contacts in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so grateful for these guys,
and I wanted to put that out there for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had some amazing guests from old
friends like Not-So-Dog, The Weasel,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Klopp, Michael Wolf Siegel,
and Dell, whose episode hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: released yet, to Mark Gallo, Kevin Jodry,
Chad Westport, and Boston Rob,
[SPEAKER_00]: whose episode I also haven't released yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so grateful for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not only helped our show take
off on a trajectory I'm struggling to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe, but they've taught me things,
and I believe I will have long lasting
[SPEAKER_00]: friendships with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only assume you can tell how much my
friendships mean to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally,
[SPEAKER_00]: our viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I made this podcast, I told people I
didn't care if anyone enjoyed this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them I was doing it for myself,
but I never thought about how much I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it if it was enjoyed by
viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you told me two months ago when we
started this that all of our videos would
[SPEAKER_00]: get thousands of views right out of the
gate, and there would be no hate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, and nothing but positivity and
love, I wouldn't believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive responses encourage me to
continue to build this network into the
[SPEAKER_00]: best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've gone on for a long time,
but hey, my name is Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to end it by saying if you're
listening to this, I'm grateful for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I look forward to making better and
better content for you in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
