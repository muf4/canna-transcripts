[SPEAKER_04]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_04]: Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_04]: and seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are the only place that you can
get the Gabby Staten Island Collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Gabby and we're actually going to
announce the new name of our show is Your
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed Stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today we're joined by Kevin Jadri from
Wonderland Nursery and from The Grateful
[SPEAKER_06]: Head and many other projects.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, Sasha, the Slovenian
Hobbit, our international correspondent,
[SPEAKER_06]: giving us some international flair.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're super excited to continue the
story with Kevin Jadri.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a great talk, I think it was a week
ago, and we weren't able to complete it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're doing this again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that you're smoking, Kev?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cherry pie is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have the cut, obviously?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, I shared it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a bunch of breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have it in that form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to, you know, I mean,
I'm somebody that's collected forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a point in your life where you
just want less plants to have to deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: in your own home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, that's how we, I mean,
you got to spread it out enough when you
[SPEAKER_06]: do that, because that's how we do stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're also at the same time to
put it into projects and then you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: play around and go play with the tool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to find it again through the hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, if I have the ability to
move the plant, I move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave it to me and said,
Kev, this is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can breed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always historically done that,
which is what's let me access so much
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: People being able to trust you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to fuck you on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
I can probably go around you and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: from someone else too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, it's just this gentleman's
agreement of if I get it from you,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't want to touch, then that's
where it stays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always, my entire career in the
game, I've always shared genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny, but a long time ago,
that shit wasn't popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get pissed off because it was,
um, I'm always, I just want to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: cultural elitism.
[SPEAKER_01]: This idea that only the special people
have the special plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you don't have to be balling
to be special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you got the right plant,
it ups your quality of life dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you not, what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, you know, moving really
valuable plants into the public,
[SPEAKER_01]: it always pays off because one,
you're doing something that's human.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, people that you give plants to
that are dependent on the plant and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: different relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones that actually hold it for
15 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can I tell you a little story?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go back, go back while you finish
rolling your joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can roll it and talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I don't know how much you know
about my story, but I had a small little
[SPEAKER_06]: piece of the chem dog story is I brought
it out West.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the one that got it from Greg and I
drove it out West.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time Greg had told me not to
really pass it around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only person that I gave it to was
Jason, you know, VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he gave it to one of his partners,
Ben from IC collective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And somehow after that, it really got out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time not being as mature as I
am today and thinking about consequences
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, you just spoke about and
also the advantages of, of giving out
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of pissed, you know,
that it got out because you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was selling the chem dog for 6,400 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like, you're getting it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but what I wanted to tell you is,
so it got out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly how it got out,
but it got out to the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, with maturity, I realized
that not only was it good that it got out,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that it was responsible for the
creation of so many new strains that
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't have happened if it didn't get
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the time I was pissed and,
you know, had regrets that had gotten out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I realize that was a great thing
that happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really, it increased the legacy of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at a point, there's a time and place
where it just needs to get out to
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we like, we're like, we know we
got the grateful head, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the idea of a repository.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't catch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're in, in, in professional
plant breeding, most professional plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders can go into a gene bank and get
true F1 stock, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get, they can get true inbred
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get a stock that's derived from
two inbred lines, which is true F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can work on projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have that in cannabis,
but we have this like really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these loose collections, which,
which I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they keep things alive during the
dark ages of law enforcement raid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, some of the stuff that I
lost, I lost because it wasn't just one
[SPEAKER_01]: raid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a raid on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another house gets hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you end up having things lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ability to be able to keep these
plants alive just, and a lot of it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say it's a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In time, it's like a memory stamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you, when, even if it's no
longer what it once was to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's something, you know, like I,
I connect the plants to like that AK 47
[SPEAKER_01]: bought my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That OG bought my fucking farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was that single plant that I
multiplied in the money that, that did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was having this, you know,
this relationship mentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's stuff like that,
that it's not even about today's
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that these things we touched in
and historically had relationships with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that the idea of like,
as many people possible touching the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, as many people possible moving it
around, as long as somebody holds it in
[SPEAKER_01]: its original form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and what we know now too,
is that when we hold plants in original
[SPEAKER_01]: form, I don't give a shit, you scrub them
and they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take a plant, and you expose it to 30
years of impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That impact changes the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant picks that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though when we use the word like
genetic drift, genetic drift implies
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and implies you're losing track
of the traits of interest that originally
[SPEAKER_01]: were in your lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're breeding a plant or you're
breeding a dog and you're moving slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the traits that you were
originally interested in until they're no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you're breeding the same line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the same traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just talking about like epigenetic
influence change, where every time you
[SPEAKER_01]: clone the plant, every, every time it's,
it's sprayed with the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: every time it's gone through some cycle,
subtle change and.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's degrading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and modifies itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like a really good example is,
and I did this years ago and I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: to somebody about it, but I had a whole,
you know, whole OG collection,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm running all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know exactly, they are not the same
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They had definitely flowering time
profile, just all the different factors
[SPEAKER_01]: that you would say, hey, side by side,
shit's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we DNA them, they all came out as
Josh D O G ghost OG, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all came out as this original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the theory was that's all S one,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth of it was that when we
really went into the DNA analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were all ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me and the science team are arguing
about it because they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just calling them different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, but as a grower,
they're definitely not the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because the traits are radically
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the need, but the DNA doesn't lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and somewhere online, I was talking
to the idea of scientists out of Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, DNA doesn't lie, but also
sometimes it's hard to get the truth out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it because we have to understand how to
really look at what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this, it was this theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That when we talk about why plants have
changed over time, and so many of them
[SPEAKER_01]: have, it's who held it and how was it
held.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you have so many variations
of all the similar same plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this cut of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth of it is, is it's the exact
same plant, but it's slowly modified after
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three, four, 500 colonial cycles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I respond to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about like, this is an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say we could clone a human.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so let's say there was a clone of
Gabby Staten Island or Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was completely identical,
but one of these clones took care of
[SPEAKER_06]: himself differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one Gabby Staten Island eats nothing
but McDonald's and, and Coca-Cola and fast
[SPEAKER_06]: food and, and doesn't exercise.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's another one that eats a
healthy meal, you know, healthy diet and
[SPEAKER_06]: exercises.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're both 90, they're both going
to look dramatically different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to say, Oh, this,
this is, these aren't the same people,
[SPEAKER_06]: but actually the DNA is the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: The DNA is not going to tell you how you
were cared for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as you, you know, go through
your years and that's going to have an
[SPEAKER_06]: effect on the body of a human or the body
of a plant.
Correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we, we were also, you know,
the conversation was about weirded a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why have they diminished?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they no longer so extraordinary?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take a look and I'm just like,
you know, I said, I don't think that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much any kind of procedural change
because that would be easy to fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were, if you were working with your
plant and you noticed a change in the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of it from crop to crop,
you'd be like, wait a second, I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong way with my process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You typically wouldn't improve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if your drying method becomes more
scientific and your quality decreases,
[SPEAKER_01]: you go back to warm by feel, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a grower, you're flexible with what you
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you, and I think it's the age of
chemical cannabis that when we really
[SPEAKER_01]: start to focus on pesticides and
insecticides and growth regulators,
[SPEAKER_01]: you started to change the metabolic
pathways of the plant because the plant no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer had the need to produce those
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it started to slowly shut off that
production route.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of 20, 30 years and
all the fuels are the ones that you really
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of this in, in terms of,
they were so heavily covered in these
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterants that over the course of 30
years of doing it, they just stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: producing what's not needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the issue is someone's like,
you know, you scrub it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought if we scrub it, we go back to
zero, but no, we go back to the zero of
[SPEAKER_01]: that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't go back to when it came out of
the seed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice idea, but all you're doing is
cleaning up the plant, but you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning up the epigenetic change.
[SPEAKER_01]: TC doesn't scrub the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you to outgrow a pathogen,
but it doesn't undo what we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, and I love TC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably the, you know,
one of the best tools you could possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: have for, you know, modern day cannabis,
because we have so many different issues
[SPEAKER_01]: that are spread through conventional
propagation now, because we have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different ad forms touching us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the first time ever,
herb is touching everything because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: location spread from a closet to a field
to the central valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're in the middle of some of
the, you know, largest ad production zone
[SPEAKER_01]: on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cross-contamination is unreal,
but regardless, you still have to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: best you can to hold the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with like land
race preservation where the minute you
[SPEAKER_01]: take it out of the country of origin,
you're not really doing land race
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation, but you're preserving what
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think, because someone said,
you know, when you're trying to do what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing, Kev, you're not doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, I kind of am though,
because really what the goal is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is to get people to be aware of stock
that's not what we would call
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticated, to get people to be aware of
other cultures that produce cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: other forms, and to be able to get access
to that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part of the preservation
that's really occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea of preserving that material
in its true form can only be done in its
[SPEAKER_01]: true form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Columbia would have to do its own
preservation, you know, gene protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: California, we don't have any native
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would just work with what we have,
but Pakistan, Afghanistan, India,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lebanon, you know, Columbia that's had,
you know, four or 500 years of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: place, that's where I think that the
preservation has to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since we don't have control of that,
we do the best we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work limited populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, you know, it'd be like Sam was
saying, you know, 10,000 is the population
[SPEAKER_01]: you want, where you have full open
population of 10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 into bread, that gives you enough
genetic capture to say that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: captured the qualities of a gene pool for
future preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's doing 10,000 fucking plants on a
preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just impractical,
you know, we don't have that ability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people are doing 10 or 20 seeds and
think that that's getting it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're picking, breeding,
and sometimes it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, you know, the outliers always
emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a good story for people is
SuperBoof, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the guy that does SuperBoof came out
of two 10 packs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he buys a pack of seeds to one,
buys a pack of seeds to the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: selects out a male and a female,
puts them together, he gets leaf leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: strain of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now people will see that and say,
I too can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, maybe, right,
maybe, maybe, you know, it's, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: always work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you can go through 100,000
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the, if the, the alleles aren't
present, that can contain that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that information, that shit isn't
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't get to, if you know,
you can have one copy and then a mutated
[SPEAKER_01]: copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not, if the copy's not present
or they're both mutant, that's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't have that, that information
to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we do the best we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of it is, is private people that
do banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you're one of them,
I'm one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, are you, you, you save plants
too, Sasha?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I have a, I'm a librarian,
you know, I have a facility in Austria
[SPEAKER_03]: where we have 35 different cultivars in
preservation form.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we cloning moms traditionally,
we gonna do tissue culture in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is our perspective of it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm following you since many years,
since you did Wonderland nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the videos where you are in the
nursery, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I wanted to ask you,
because you were talking about this
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic drift, I remember very clearly
that you were talking about Louie,
[SPEAKER_03]: the 13 OG Kush in one video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were showing the plant and you
were talking about that you were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: Bokashi and Gokashi techniques to bring it
back because it was kind of sick because
[SPEAKER_03]: these people that brought you this plant
brought you a sick plant, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you tried to actually, how,
is it still alive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you still- Oh yeah,
yeah, the Louie's alive and it got moved
[SPEAKER_01]: into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with the Louie was the Louie
came out of a, a group of Armenian
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of some crazy coincidence,
I help out their mother-in-law,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she's just an older lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just nice to her one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I help her out with the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she gives my phone number to her
son-in-law and he hits me up and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey, I'm this dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he rolls up in a range room over
with his crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all hop out in suits and they hand me
a couple of clones and say, these will
[SPEAKER_01]: change your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was laughing because I already had a
whole OG collection, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just one more OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was this beautiful thought and it
was a thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just grateful because it was
like so pure where you helped out our
[SPEAKER_01]: mother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to help you with the ability
to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the issue was what we, we,
we had discovered with like Hop Layton,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause like, remember I've been doing this
shit for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when Hop Layton pops up,
we're all getting fucking hammered by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause none of us really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we know there's some kind of mutation,
but we don't understand what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get lucky in that I get a team of
scientists that come to me and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: SoCal, Central Cal and Humboldt and this
cat named Rick Crum, a PhD geneticist
[SPEAKER_01]: named Rick Crum says, Hey, what we have is
we've discovered some kind of pathogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a name for it right now,
but we know what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand what it's doing to the
plant, but we just don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to see if you wanted to play
around with the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, because I was having a
conversation with this guy named Alan
[SPEAKER_01]: Atkinson, who was from the Probiotic
Farmers Alliance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and Mike had created the Alliance and,
and Alan's background was in silage,
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation, anaerobics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had this belief that if we
returned the system back to this
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobically driven, low oxygen
environment, which is really what earth
[SPEAKER_01]: is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very low O2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I had this discussion with Elaine
Ingham, cause Elaine Ingham came to visit
[SPEAKER_01]: me after she saw this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could kind of understand how do you
define low oxygen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really like this just line of
PPM, how many parts per million a person?
[SPEAKER_01]: So she, she was like, if you don't have,
you know, oxygen driven compost tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: it won't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I showed her Alan's sub irrigation
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she realized that there's like this
gray area that's in between anaerobics and
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just becomes this determination of
what do you define as low or no oxygen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Alan's deal was that he believed
that if you put a plant back into this sub
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation system and you allowed it to
naturally, you know, drive its function,
[SPEAKER_01]: we should see a return to homostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has a hypothesis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, all right, let's, let's,
let's see if we can turn into a theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to prove the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up getting that, that plant
from the lab and it's infected and we know
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put it in isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it into that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of like, 45 days,
it basically just sat still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cause it was heavily impacted and
impacted would imply in this case,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a Girl Scout cookie cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from an operation that used to
have a hundred percent strike rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went down to like 3% strike rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of the thousand clones,
you know, they were getting 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, just low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they said, Hey, we know this is
impacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the impact is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take it and I put it in the system
and I sit it in this, in this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this chamber and it just sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden I started to see like
the surface cracking and you could see new
[SPEAKER_01]: cambium material forming, like these lines
coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as this new cambium material was
creating, it was shedding all its old
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and new leaves were appearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I had this new formation,
I cut those clones and they all rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put them under a light to grow
them up, but I stressed one side of a tray
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was getting too much light
exposure for its age and it re-triggered
[SPEAKER_01]: the hoplite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I had the lab constantly
testing everything, we were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was when we discovered that if you
can keep a plant in some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: homostasis and natural balance,
the hoplite doesn't seem to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean it won't transmit it,
but it didn't affect its secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite production.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't that also depend on the viral
load?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't that also depend on the viral
load?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if there's a low viral load,
it's not going to impact it very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, it does, but these plants were
covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had high, high load.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were absolutely falling apart,
which was, let's, let's try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there was, they didn't understand
that the degree of, in fact, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, the brilliant guys, but you gotta
remember it's the dawn of this problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with like russet mites and shit
like that, where people would be like that
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mites and like, well who the fuck
didn't?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody even knew we had them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to go buy a microscope to identify
the problem because there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: predecessor before us to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're, when you're in an industry
and you're like, you're first,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're, you're doing this at
speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to catch all the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's interesting because
when you get into science, it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because they're brilliant and they
have every tool known to mankind doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mean they understand the problem they just
discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to figure out,
is this something you can work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I stress those plants,
the ones that got stressed reverted and
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that didn't didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, whoa, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to do is add some stress load
to the organism and the, the Viroid
[SPEAKER_01]: reemergence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that you could have plants
that, that appeared completely clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: but without testing, you weren't aware you
were passing the Viroid forward because
[SPEAKER_01]: your operation wasn't overly stress in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the ones that were under stressed,
I mean, they were, you know, kept with the
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the strike rate went right back
up to a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went right back up to a thousand out
of a thousand on the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it worked well for them, but it let me
understand how plants respond and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: impact these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I got that box in and I already
had the cut from, from on the Louie,
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in that system to see if I could
do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I get it to return back to like an
original state?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed and it became a beautiful plant
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I shared that out into the
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a bunch of different people have,
Alan still runs it, a couple of local
[SPEAKER_01]: farms still use it as their component.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a copy of that, you probably
had to have got it from me because there
[SPEAKER_01]: was nobody that was, it was an in-house OG
held by a group that did not share the cut
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was super valuable at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a, you know, in my facility,
we have a cross with it's called soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you are Americans call
it, but it's Z A W T Z it's from compound,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's a breather cut from,
from Chris and it's Louis the 13 OG cross
[SPEAKER_03]: to skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might've got that like when,
when node first started node and
[SPEAKER_01]: conception, basically the majority of the
plants that they put into the system came
[SPEAKER_01]: from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when, when node lit up as an
operation, it was through my collection
[SPEAKER_01]: that they mind the majority of that
original stock before they, before they
[SPEAKER_01]: built the relationship with, with Chris,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got, you got Chris Lynch,
who was compound who then merges with node
[SPEAKER_01]: that becomes compound and they have a
fallout.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before all that took place,
when node first lit up, we were all going
[SPEAKER_01]: to work together and they came over and
harvested a tremendous amount of material
[SPEAKER_01]: from us to begin the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not saying he definitely got it for
me, but there's some plants that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: without a question that shit was not in
the system till I put it in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but it's a nice feeling, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta, you gotta put the genes in so
that people can play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, it's just about
interests, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can spark interest in people,
and you know, there's always a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like mythological unicorn in your
mind that if you could get your hands on
[SPEAKER_01]: this, your whole world would be better,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes when you get the plant,
you know, the hype is bigger than the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality and you're like, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then other times you get ahold of
something and you're like, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to smoke this every day for
the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know, you just don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea though is to create the
excitement and to get people to be
[SPEAKER_01]: curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of it is, you know,
for the older crowd, which I'm one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, it's this idea of like trying to go
back in time and touch things from our
[SPEAKER_01]: youth, because so much of it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, it changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had this discussion about sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about sour diesel and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one is yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, the good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I ran 20 different ones side
by side, that's the one that stood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I really give a fuck what the name is
at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because unless you're, and even from the
dudes that held the shit, half of them
[SPEAKER_01]: lost the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been in the game long enough,
you got raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got raided, your fucking plants
vanished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to get plants back from
someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute that shit leaves your hand and
goes to anybody else, maybe it comes back
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it sometimes comes back better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people actually, you know,
they're, they're holding them in naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: lit spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got them in supplementally lit
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're running them under biological drive
to keep them healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants that you selected
originally were under light and chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: and rock wool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you selected the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the idea that every plant is
better biologically sungrown is not true
[SPEAKER_01]: because the selection was done under
artificial light with chemical,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, it's the impact of everything
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That creates that equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have to understand it that,
you know, I mean, some of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear to God, some of the best OG I ever
smoked in my life came out of Todd
[SPEAKER_01]: McCormick's rock wool block.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, he's got the original OG,
but when we were smoking it at his house,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, goddamn Todd, that's some
really good OG kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you couldn't deny it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some sungrown SFV that was
cracking, but it had an influence that was
[SPEAKER_01]: a little different than what my memory
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of OG, because OG was all
originally indoor driven.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to respond to that by mentioning
a comment that Michael Wolf Siegel made in
[SPEAKER_06]: the last podcast we recorded.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he talked about how there's,
I believe he said eight terpenes or six
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes that will never be found on
indoor cannabis because the UV light isn't
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're supplementing, I believe he
said it with like UVB, which most people
[SPEAKER_06]: aren't gonna do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you talk about the way certain
stuff tastes, if it was sungrown or indoor
[SPEAKER_06]: grown, you're not gonna have that UV and
then you might not have those terpenes,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is what you remember as,
you know, the flavor profile of that
[SPEAKER_06]: straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lack of, because remember they're
all, you're making something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna use it like cooking,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna make a dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes what you added or what you
didn't add creates the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're talking about anything
to do with secondary metabolite profile
[SPEAKER_01]: and influence, when you're looking at like
hop testing is pretty comprehensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: more comprehensive than cannabis because
there was no legality to it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're looking at hop testing,
you can take two identical hop cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: that have a single PPB difference in one
metabolite.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good that we're gathering some
information, but it doesn't tell us the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, because at the end of the day,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about moonlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because moonlight's reflection,
how does that bent spectrum influence it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I got to do, I got lucky that
I'm not a fucking scientist, my mother
[SPEAKER_01]: was, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm always really clear about what
a scientist is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely focused, prove it,
multiple locations kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it lets you understand that science is
powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's powerful a tool as there ever was,
but it's not omnipotent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't understand everything until
it's able to really kind of rip it to
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got brought in to do the LED
development for Heliospectra when they
[SPEAKER_01]: first lit up as a business and they came
into North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got selected as the person with the
operation they wanted to do the trials
[SPEAKER_01]: with, which was unbelievable because it
was the first really tunable LED plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do anything with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like 15, 16 grand a plate at the
time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Full iPad control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit that they're talking about
now, that shit was in 2008, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2008, the company flies in,
the president flies in, team of scientists
[SPEAKER_01]: fly in, we set up the test operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running the same cultivar,
but under their system and then under my
[SPEAKER_01]: system side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the part that was fascinating was that
the level of light engineers they brought
[SPEAKER_01]: in were brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a woman out of the UK named
Tessa Babcock that she worked for the Bill
[SPEAKER_01]: Gates Institute and she was making sure
that I understood that it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: information that the sun provides via
these frequencies that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's just like, look, she goes,
I'm working for the Bill Gates Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, it's fucking unlimited money.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, there's nothing but super
geniuses in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, I'm telling you, we barely
understand what's taking place from
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we do the best we can to
create an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by using steered tuning, it allows us
to do some interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the example was it was on basil,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pertaining to certain countries
like different leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like different length and a long
elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they do is dial in the spectra to make
that occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, all of these that you're looking
at, she says, I'm showing you all these
[SPEAKER_01]: basil samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, it's all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, we adjust the morphology through
spectral tuning, which makes the country
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like motor oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Americans like golden oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese like green oil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you buy motor oil in Japan and
pour it into your cottage, shit comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pour it, when you pour motor oil
into your car in America, shit comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because Americans believe that golden
oil is clean oil, and it's good oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Japanese believe that green oil is
good oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's zero to do with the viscosity or
any of those shear factors, anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: implies fluid dynamics under tension,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Under pressure and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purely about what people like or what
they don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what was so fascinating with,
you know, the indoor world to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the tuning and the adjustment and the
focus, it's just that if you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: these things to hold things long term,
over the course of 15, 20 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to have change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's this reality that it helped me
understand that, like I was chasing skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: forever because I had this massive
collection of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for whatever reason, I was just really
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I acquired a collection of plants that
all had a really, really similar aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, but very different morphological
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, you know, and I lost them
in a raid in like early 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mom room that we had as a
redundant mom room, they got hit in an
[SPEAKER_01]: armed robbery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idiots that robbed the spot
thought it was a grow house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't realize it was a mom bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they came in, there was no flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they found an armed robbery,
fucking family gets held at gunpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take the moms and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was done, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We lose that stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go back into the world to see if I
can find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm digging and I'm digging and I'm
digging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't that like, I'm going to be
the discoverer of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't about a public, like it has to
be Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that I was excited about looking
for something that used to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you share hunts with people in a
lot of regards, it inspires people to hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: their own shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just to chase that, but to chase what
you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanted, you know, I want the old piff
cut I got way back in the day because none
[SPEAKER_01]: of these have that, that, what do you call
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The bathroom, the bathroom test where you
walk in the bathroom and the shit's still
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging in the air 10 minutes after you
burn a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that, it's the chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't care what population I went
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this created this whole online shit
storm about people saying, I got the real
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, if somebody's got the
real one, break the fucking thing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that somebody can at least enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's stunky and there's things,
but it's just, I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to a point where I just stopped
looking because I got tired of digging in
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, someone said, did you find
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no, I said, I dug for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through all these populations from
out of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through all populations that I was
digging through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found stuff that was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had, I had a skunk on it like 1981,
like old, old skunk out of the Hills
[SPEAKER_01]: humble ancient held forever, but it didn't
have that, that we would say skunked his
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, but it's thigh oil level was
insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you cut a clone off that it would
basically fill a building with that musky
[SPEAKER_01]: deep aromatic, make you kind of almost
sweat when you, when you experienced it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a different direction that I was
seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted that noxious, you know,
skunk urine and I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the one day I just realized it
was okay that maybe that was just what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it was a memory that I had an
experience once long ago that I enjoyed
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it was done, it was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to see plants almost like
people that you hung out with that you
[SPEAKER_01]: really enjoyed hanging out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to go and replace that
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to go find a new buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: New, new family member and new,
new, anything that is that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you're going to get different things
and you need to learn to appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: different things and just be grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to experience it when it was in
your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin, is this the, the, the videos that
show you, uh, drawing, uh, like a line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you say, this is the sixties,
seventies, eighties, nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: These circles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's spheres of influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's if we can get back far enough and
open up the population, what do we get
[SPEAKER_01]: into?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every time we, we hybridize or
move the plant forward and that's genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we lose the traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: The traits of interest that we originally
were so attracted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see it in, in, in, in,
I'm fascinated by dogs because I am a dog
[SPEAKER_01]: freak at heart, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's, it's doing development on
a dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's specific things of
interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you bred, you lost track of the
traits and you weren't doing the job you
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to do with evaluating the progeny,
the children to make sure that those
[SPEAKER_01]: things would be in married forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is we do, they call it
like paper breeding where you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the animals via a chart or you're
looking at plants via a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chart lets you understand where it
came from, but it doesn't necessarily tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you what is imparted from that plant or
that dog in its subsequent breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because it came from something,
doesn't mean it contains the shit you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's super skunk from Sansi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that profile you wanted isn't in that
pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can run that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause people, that's, that's the illusion
that you open up a population,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's present.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, if the, if those genes aren't
present, that shit isn't there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to have them just appear
from nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it's the, and the people
are today will experience it in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: way with the things that were really
prevalent and popular for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making a joke about, you know,
the legacy gelato cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people love gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they didn't love it, it wouldn't have
been, it's kind of like Skittle,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a profile that people really,
really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it 30 years and people will want to
go back to that legacy Skittle cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after 30 years, is it still tasting
like powdered Tang?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the astronaut drink,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it might not, and then people will
say, oh, it was way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be like, oh, you're old,
you're reminiscing, your memories are off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, you're incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be screaming, no, no,
I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're screaming, no, no, it was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people like, you're old and your
memory's failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was, that rendition from that
time was better than today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we have the most grown
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you know, the amount of
information we have about how to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis right now is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't have any more fucking
knowledge because you had so much money in
[SPEAKER_01]: tier development, so much money in
exterior development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now you have science that can
access it via hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've never been smarter,
but it doesn't change the fact that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to resurrect shit that isn't
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just done.
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a comment the last time we talked
about how the U S and Australia had the
[SPEAKER_06]: least amount of experience growing
cannabis in comparison to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like Pakistan and these other countries
that they've been growing it for thousands
[SPEAKER_06]: of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it made me think of something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And does that mean that because you have
less experience in years that you have
[SPEAKER_06]: less knowledge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I used to own a grow
shop in a, in Willets and there'd be,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, old timers that would come up
and say, well, we've been doing it like
[SPEAKER_06]: this for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you've been doing it wrong for 20
years, or if you've, if you haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: continued to learn for those 20 years,
that doesn't actually mean that you have
[SPEAKER_06]: more knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess my question for you was,
do you think that even though we have the
[SPEAKER_06]: less, the least experience here in the U S
that we have the least knowledge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think a lot of people would
certainly think that we've got the most
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge when it comes to cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're talking about indoor
development, you're, you're definitely not
[SPEAKER_01]: talking anything against Holland.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I, when I study greenhouse
work, that's all plant empowerment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all Dr. Wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all, that's all Dutch.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we're talking cannabis
specifically, Holland is a very small
[SPEAKER_06]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is far bigger than... They're
agricultural approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not following that approach,
you basically go in the wrong route.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, they're the ones that really
determine like, you know, leaf temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: is what drives the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like so much of the information we have
came out of that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do I think Americans aren't talented?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do I think that just because you've
done something for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: does it make you smarter than someone
else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a population of plants
that are present that have been naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: selected through environmental pressure,
then that means you've got 2000 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: data in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where for us, our whole world has been so
erratic that it broke these custodial
[SPEAKER_01]: chains and it truncated the populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got down into very bottleneck
populations, very specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what we did is when I say that
we have the least amount of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it means we have the least amount of time
for the plant to acclimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, especially because of the war on
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used Australia too because it's the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's these two places seem to have the
last on the cannabis food chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a knock to either place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just a statement of fact that if
your family lived in an area for 50 years
[SPEAKER_01]: and their family lived in an area for 2000
years, I would assume your relatives and
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have higher adaptation to that
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that my family's all like
Eastern Northern Europeans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we live in New England on the coast
for the same house for like 320 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I know is that when I hang out with
my friends, there's not one of them that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not warmer than, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where like I'm wearing a t-shirt in the
winter, but everybody else is wearing a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking down coat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to do really well in cold weather
and I don't even necessarily like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I seem to be able to handle
it different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just know that I've adapted to that
cold ass Eastern European climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my family moves in to New England
where we're on the coast of Maine for
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking three centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I've adapted subtly to be
able to deal with that temperature better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get sun tan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to wear like, and I work in the
sun, but I have to wear a hat and I got to
[SPEAKER_01]: wear some sun clothes or otherwise I'll
still get a good burn even at 60 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My body hasn't had enough adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I lived in Africa and I bred and I
bred and my children bred and bred and
[SPEAKER_01]: bred and bred and you go 2,000 years,
some of them are going to have higher
[SPEAKER_01]: melanin content and they're going to
definitely have an adaptation to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that's what occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that we're not bright or the
Australians aren't bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not to say that, you know,
anybody's, I always give the Dutch credit
[SPEAKER_01]: because almost every single thing you
touch is Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like Wolf Mayer came out with
the Sea of Green with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the idea of stacking plants in density
was not foreign to agriculture before
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not to knock Wolf because I know
Wolf and I respect him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a brilliant guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is so much of these things
that we do come from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: other methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, like, you know, I went heavy into
sub-irrigation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And sub-irrigation was how I ran all the
operations because it allowed you to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to flood beds and control the soak
and then the reflow back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all taken right out of Dutch ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just do it in large diesel
driven buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would create, we would custom
build the tables because fucking ag tables
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't buy a pre-made table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a carpenter I worked with and we
drew up a blueprint and then I would
[SPEAKER_01]: fiberglass the tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I wanted to do a project,
I just let them know, hey, I need 22
[SPEAKER_01]: tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would be able to go get the
cut list, go purchase the material,
[SPEAKER_01]: assemble the tables, glass them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would go pick them up in trucks and
bring them up to the operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we were using tools from
other countries because those things
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't readily applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, you could get like a three
by three table because that was all that
[SPEAKER_01]: was like the original plastic table was
like the sun systems and American
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I knew him from the store,
but we weren't friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gennaro is a little, a little cooler in
some regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew Gennaro's kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but the three by three tables just
didn't grid outright because those were
[SPEAKER_01]: designed for solar systems, spins,
lower, lower intensity light, where what I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted was to stack thousands over 16
square feet so that I could, I could get
[SPEAKER_01]: what I wanted, which was quicker cyclical
time, heavier yield per square meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just custom built the tables,
but all that stuff was stuff that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: learning, going to college for plant
propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I really started to, you know,
dig into where the knowledge came from
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, between Israel has given you all
your science on cannabis predominantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the deep research on, on profile,
and molecular weights all coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel and the Dutch are giving you pretty
much, you know, and was every greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: has some, it has to, they're the ones that
did all the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did is we took cannabis and
turned it into this, this cult before it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a product that was in countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it got to the U S and U S turns it
into a cult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the U S and like, so that's my
opinion, but the U S has the ability to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something most countries don't,
which is project that shit into the world
[SPEAKER_01]: through the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the U S is what really hyped up so much
of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you take a look at the
internet, the internet kind of goes along
[SPEAKER_01]: and you see like OG Kush was one of the
first things spoke on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl scout cookie was like, to me,
the first plant that was really exploded
[SPEAKER_01]: through the internet because that was the
only way people could still access.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was never big on forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a couple of them and I'd check
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a lot of the forum cats,
it was a community that they needed
[SPEAKER_01]: because they didn't have one in their
lives because they were, they were too
[SPEAKER_01]: hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all those years from, you know,
for me, from 25 to 50 from a 60,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in Humboldt County where that
shit wasn't hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single one of your neighbors was
sparked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody around you was sparked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it did is it allowed you a
different type of relationship where you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't feel like you were on your own,
you know, living in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you were on the East Coast,
Midwest, you know, places like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really, you really didn't have an
ability to ever kind of come out and talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about weed publicly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to use the forums.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even living in Sonoma County, it was like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, even living in Sonoma County,
it was like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, because Sonoma's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonoma's, you have, yeah, it's Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt's an outlaw county in terms of
like, fuck you, we're going to go big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radically different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say Mendo is way more craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more craft orientated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo was more craft orientated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt was go as big as you possibly
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just no limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bigger was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrapping yourself in money was not a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Humboldt was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: People talk about, what's the legacy
strains of Humboldt County?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, whatever one's sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the minute that shit was moving in
velocity, those cuts were here and being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced and that product was leaving and
feeding the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Humboldt was different, but it allowed,
just like right now, I don't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm online, but not to the degree a lot of
people are because I'm actually able to
[SPEAKER_01]: work in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have other resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: For a lot of people, the only resources
they have is what they can find online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think it's a lovely thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what it's done is it's
created, it has a duality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're living on the online world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's right because it's you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get centered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you don't really have,
I would say, an open mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have an open idea mentally
because no matter what it's, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at it through your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter what you do, you're filtering
information through your biases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just what we naturally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's human.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything different than you, your senses
tell you be wary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a survival instinct,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you develop it and that becomes
true and real, we had this discussion the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the idea about, we use the word
craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave a lecture on craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did is I interviewed a bunch of
people on what is craft and their opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked them, what's craft?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I asked them, and how do you
grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And each person, their method fit their
identity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Craft is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, and how do you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Only by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other person was, craft is these
things because they use drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craft is, only indoor living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craft is understanding how to drive back a
block to get the best expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each individual had identical reflection
of their work into their identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my point of that lecture was
that craft is wild and free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anything you want it to be because,
and it's not your intent, because intent
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't do shit in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when they say the road to hell is
paved with good intentions, it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens from the intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the actual experience of the person
you're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't define that you're a craft
operator if everyone who smokes your
[SPEAKER_01]: product says it sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not fucking craft, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Craft is a dramatic word, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: K-R-A-F-T.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really implies by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the craft, and that's like an 1850
word, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes out at the same time the arts and
crafts movement comes out, which was this
[SPEAKER_01]: fight back against the industrial era.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the industrial era is emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this cheap shit's being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this group emerges and says,
that's not what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what people didn't understand was that
that arts and crafts craft movement wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: about this really high-end shit you looked
at at the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a screwdriver that had a really
beautiful handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a hammer that when you held it,
you wanted to hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craftsman tools.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about things you use daily,
frequently, but at a higher level,
[SPEAKER_01]: because those are the things that had gone
through mass production had changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why that whole craft
movement worked was they had a craft
[SPEAKER_01]: symposium that was held and it exposed
people to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from 1850s, 1860s, all the way up until
the Great Depression, this craft movement
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I researched it originally because I
used to do fine woodwork as a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started getting into architecture in
terms of studying periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this craftsman era in homes
at that turn of the century that was
[SPEAKER_01]: about, and it returned again later in
time, it returns again in the 2000s,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it was this change to go back to
smaller homes with higher quality details,
[SPEAKER_01]: where a bigger house wasn't more important
than a better door handle, than a better
[SPEAKER_01]: sink, than the elevation of the rooms in
terms of ceiling height to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taller heights give you more expansive
thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shorter heights make you feel more secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's adjusting the ceiling heights
in spaces, it's the lighting, it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: feel, it's the detail, it's you're doing
woodwork and highlighting this artistic
[SPEAKER_01]: expression versus what became known as the
McMansion, which was these cardboard
[SPEAKER_01]: houses that were fucking caverns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's like, look at my cavernous
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you go to touch the door handle,
and it's a cheap door handle, and you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing you touch every day is the
doorknob, and the doorknob sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of returned back into this
craft world for people who had the money
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy the McMansion, but wanted more of
this internal stimulation from the things
[SPEAKER_01]: they touched and did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I was doing all this work on
craft and just trying to understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: argument, because each one of us
constantly says, what's the definition of
[SPEAKER_01]: craft?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an acre tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no drip systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be sungrown biologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Driven to be craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it drove me into really researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had done all this wine research for the
Appalachian project that I had helped work
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes down to how do you view a thing,
and do people view it the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's going to always be this
dissension, and it's just kind of what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just say, look, if you're
somebody that is living right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're 19 years old, and you're
smoking your favorite shit, you might want
[SPEAKER_01]: to just hold on to that plant and hold on
to it for emotional sake, but just realize
[SPEAKER_01]: in 30 years, the odds of it being the same
plant you smoked when you were 19 is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, similar, but subtly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with TC scrub, because the thing
is the plant, if you wanted to return to
[SPEAKER_01]: the norm, you'd have to go back to the
parents, and you'd have to have them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same situation they were in when they
did the work, because they're passing that
[SPEAKER_01]: information on to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in Pakistan, when I went to all the
villages, I was like, what's your native
[SPEAKER_01]: stock in your village?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, we really don't have any,
Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is we constantly share material
with other villages around us,
[SPEAKER_01]: and stock that'll come in from Afghanistan
will move in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got partners that are Iranian,
my partner's Iranian, his family still
[SPEAKER_01]: lives in Iran, they cross the border and
grow dope in Afghanistan and then bring
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds back into Iran and then shift
the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a bunch of seed stock that got
moved via that route to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's their selection, what they
wanted, what the market wants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they narrow the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I learned is that there's no way
to preserve any of this unless you can
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve a good seed batch of that
original material, and you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve it in some kind of repository
where it's held at the right moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's held at the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing germination testing,
and once you get to a certain level of
[SPEAKER_01]: germination failure, you have to do
another repopulation of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where really, like Australia
and the US, where the last in line we have
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the stricter laws on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit, you know how much a pound in
New Zealand's going for right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost nine grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So New Zealand, and I started laughing,
I said, I'm flying to New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can hide a couple pounds in the
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get three pounds, you're talking
27K.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the restrictions are still so deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dominant in so many places,
it just changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that people just need to
be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I have some handle on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that no matter where I go and
what I dig into, you see shift,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay that the things are different
than they once were.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't be the same as they always
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobster is small.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, the lobster would lay
across your table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was from my whole town that I lived in,
the village, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all commercial fishermen,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be the dragon, either doing
shellfish, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cogs and clams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing lobster and crab,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up eating lobster so much that
it was a normal food item.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You used to have to get these giant
channel lock pliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't using hand crackers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't get it around the goddamn
bottom of the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had these huge channel locks you'd use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a kid, you weren't even strong
enough to break it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to use a frigging hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swordfish used to come in different
colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like yellow swordfish, pink
swordfish, and it was all basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, big blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't see those variations when
you buy swordfish anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see the subtleties in the
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just realized that those things
that I once had as a kid, we probably just
[SPEAKER_01]: overfished it, wiped it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just no longer present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how the gym pool also goes now
in modern cannabis industry, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so brother with sister, with cousin,
with grandmother again, with grandfather
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all the time the same families
collide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's they're sexy and it makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, but the problem is it
was I got into this the other day,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I said it right,
but it pissed some people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was about big ag doesn't phenohunt
and everyone started screaming they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing was I got to work with the
guy that developed GMO corn from Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it gets any fucking
higher than that in the food chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was, you know, he's brilliant
PhD, but like he when you people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: catch it, when you get to a certain level
in breathing, there's only so many
[SPEAKER_01]: companies you can actually go work for and
make any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically, you know,
a bear, which is now Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_01]: Syngenta, BASF.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only there's only so many
companies where your skill, just like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a brilliant neurosurgeon,
you're not working at the local fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency room.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't pay back your doctor,
your doctor debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to go where the money is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go four or five hundred grand into
school debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go make the cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also need to be able to use the
tools or otherwise you're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfying your desires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get lucky in that in life I get to
bump into these guys and and and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: astounded that cannabis was, you know,
phenohunting and that there was no no
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred populations to pull from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, he goes, we go to the
corn pack and we basically go grab inbred
[SPEAKER_01]: mines that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, that's what took so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis was the science teams to
inbrede the populations that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to use for their hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was trying to tell somebody because
people are saying, you know, science guys
[SPEAKER_01]: can't do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right, so you're still
riding a fucking horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say across the ocean in a rowboat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't for science and whole
dynamics.
[SPEAKER_06]: No air conditioning, no ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I don't worship at the altar of
science, but I know damn well what it can
[SPEAKER_01]: do when you give it time and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the idea that lions are what
they work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They try to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if it's a fucking tomato where you
have a variation of a tomato, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it by clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go buy tomatoes, when I buy some of
these old antiquity, antiquity tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I take the seed out of the
tomato, we recreate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holds those seed and does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a fucking exact copy of each one?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's some shifts, but the majority
of the traits pretty much breed true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows you to have enough genetic
variation to hopefully ward off future
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens, which is the issue with the
inbreeding shit is that when you take a
[SPEAKER_01]: look, it's the problem with the fuels is
that when we got into doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: work in the United States, so much of the
Afghani work because you don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking like so low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dry up in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm talking like the skin on your
lips cracks off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're drinking gallons of water when
you are not even warm because you're so
[SPEAKER_01]: dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hang herb and it's drying in the
room as you're as you're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy how bone dry it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really didn't understand how the
fuck you could get such agricultural like
[SPEAKER_01]: quality with so little water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's glacial flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So atmospherically bone dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because you have a, you know,
twenty seven thousand foot cap of of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, historic ice that's constantly
moving and flowing down is glacier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the water comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't worry about the tritis and they
don't worry about PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you move those materials into the
US, all of a sudden, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: had these pathogens and the material that
we bred and use inherently had that trait
[SPEAKER_01]: of susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It it it spawned like I always tell
people, I said, don't tell me any fuel
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're touching didn't get covered
with some evil at some point in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you about the amount of that
shit that got used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing was, I got lucky that I
knew how to read an SDS sheet and so
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't willing to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mother, my mother wasn't about what
I did at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my mother was somebody that I could I
could call on the phone and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark, what do I need to be aware of with
these products?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would send me the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she would just send it from her office
and say, here, this is what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so it helped me understand that all
the stuff that we were using was
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely cumulative in its response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that at some point in time,
you would saturate with this shit and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to be able to get it out of the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and it caused problems,
too, because like for us at the nursery,
[SPEAKER_01]: we ran a bio nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were getting hammered at times
trying to understand, how do you really
[SPEAKER_01]: use biological pest control at scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always get some people talking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what no one can talk shit on was the
extraction companies that I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the only fucking vendor they could
get clones from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make product that could go into a
system that was tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go through these evolutions
of how do you take tools that are
[SPEAKER_01]: effective and replace them with natural
systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what really helped me understand
the issues we were going to face with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic ag at scale, because there is no
other crop that's run at that density
[SPEAKER_01]: level they want herb run at biological.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't you just don't have that level
of density in a house and the plant count,
[SPEAKER_01]: the no nobility to use tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just everyone relied on these
things, but those things change the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and they they allowed us to use plants and
projects that we really shouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same issue with like
feminization.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are anti-feminization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to be anti-feminization,
too, because we noticed micro seed seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the when the product came in,
the lab that I worked with, brilliant lab
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists like Kev, they always we always
notice these microscopic seeds that come
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of this feminized work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started to have a disbelief in
feminization as a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I learned was that it's it's
incredibly powerful tool to isolate and
[SPEAKER_01]: trap traits of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that when you do reversals,
the plants that reverse the quickest are
[SPEAKER_01]: also the ones most prone to intersex
tendencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to chase the money,
but you're also weaving in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea then is you go through the
line and you got to go select out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, that's my whole point
with this phenol hunt and shit is that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis was a seed line that you ran and
there was enough diversity within it to
[SPEAKER_01]: give you some protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the part that's so interesting is they
they have identified, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the chromosome where this marker is
that says this is the gene that controls
[SPEAKER_01]: your PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we know is that you have all
these interlinked genes that that many
[SPEAKER_01]: genes combined cause an expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we start to go in and start to work
with cannabis and start to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: crisper it a little, which is remove it,
shorten it, or you start to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: traits and you only select for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know the big picture impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of what that does, because we've never
done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the beginning of like,
what are we doing to the actual plant
[SPEAKER_01]: itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because cannabis is so unbelievably
complicated as a plant and almost every
[SPEAKER_01]: other ag crop is basically evaluated by
tons per acre, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bushels per acre, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when you're breeding corn,
which someone was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding corn, I'm like, what you feed in
the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you quite understand the
impact of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like you're feeding countries with a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The impact is massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only viewed as a success if you're
getting more in that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would imply that it had
protections installed into it to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever it is, what matters is you
get more.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis, that's not how we evaluate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about did you enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you have this human
evaluation, it's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, the question is,
you know, are we going to be able to use
[SPEAKER_01]: science and humans together to steer true
breeding populations that can be used in
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridization, access to gene banks to
bring interesting material into projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ability for science to look at
stuff in a way to help us that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists understand how do we use
scientific principles in our breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: but steering the end product to be
consumptive quality, not just measure,
[SPEAKER_01]: because analytics and COAs and all the
other shit, it gets you to a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know the riddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always call them the riddles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many things together create the
answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's important to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think and I'm and I know that
there are some people that are absolutely,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, drowning in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talk, you know, Sam, I was on a
podcast with Dave Watson the other day,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one guy spent his whole life drowning
in weed, drowning in like, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody went that damn deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's he's like the hash makers I met in
Pakistan, where when I'm talking to an old
[SPEAKER_01]: guy and I'm like, when did you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, my first memories of being like
three working with my father in the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: room, beat hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, I don't know any other life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, and neither did my father and
neither did my father's father.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, we've been there for 1800 years
making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes in the techniques have evolved
because we've got different material to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with the quality of the fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, they beat on and the
understanding of how to work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was when he was holding a piece of
hash and he was rolling it in his fingers
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was moving through his hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was kind of mystified by it because
it was like 2000 years of hash touching
[SPEAKER_01]: was being I was seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was probably in his 40s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and looking like he's in his 70s,
man, living in the mountains rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way the hash moved in his fingers,
I just was like, wow, just forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, you know, you're born a
Rothschild Rothschild wasn't the original
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name they took.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're you're you have a genius father
who has sons that kick ass and every kid
[SPEAKER_01]: after them was shaped and groomed.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you get to right now,
how smart are they in money?
[SPEAKER_01]: If all you've done is instill information
every generation and you're only selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing that route, at what point are
you really really talented at something?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I don't see myself in that
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I I I'm lucky that I got to experience
so much and I have some opinions and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some shit I know is fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of it is to be just still
mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's why I like her so
much is that it's what I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The no one's shit gets dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, yeah, fuck, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's the mystery is the fun part.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: That you say that because I don't know if
we talked about it the last time,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I have strong opinions on certain
subjects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would be exciting and amazing if I
was proven wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't have this ego where,
like, I want to be right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather learn something new.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so I think I mentioned in the
last time we spoke about, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: the debate between organic and inorganic
in a container grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think that if you try to do it
in a container indoors in two months,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to have a hard time doing it
organic in comparison to using minerals.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if someone were to show me,
oh, look how easy it is to do it organic
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're going to get a higher quality
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be so glad that I that I was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it was about labor,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's I know you need basically you
know, like we kind of have some ideas that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need at least 15 to 20 gallons of soil
as a sink for a plant in order to get
[SPEAKER_01]: enough material to access to work in what
we would call like a living indoor system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get into two and three gallon
pots, that shit's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just requires very frequent
supplementation where you're adding more
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it just comes down to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with if you're running
a blue mass that is that cheating where
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants the moisture level in the media
is telling it when it needs to be wet
[SPEAKER_01]: versus by hand when you feel the plants
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it's cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fight over this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what matters is that the method that
you're using works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it produces good quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I consume I consume some salt pot
that is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I consume some salt pot that's
pretty damn bland where it looks with
[SPEAKER_06]: organic though, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back in the day people organic
because it's carbon based.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're saying that you're using
chemical delivery as your nutrient source.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we're not using chemistry on
the top end of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I'm not I'm not so picky where I
won't consume anything that's salt based
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that what I notice is that some
things that are salt based grown just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have the same quality as things that
are organically produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organically we're going to we're going
to say is as biologically driven or I call
[SPEAKER_01]: it exudate driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant sugars are driving the fucking
process, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants driving the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the word organic with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so that we have a context because
the words get used so interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But chemically driven, meaning you're
using you're using a salt solution to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, do the uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some incredible cannabis that comes
out of that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of the mixes give better
results than others, depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar, depending on what person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of you got to be able to say
best is a very specific phrase that
[SPEAKER_01]: implies a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all herb grown outdoors better than
all herb grown indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear it all the time and I'm like,
it's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking about, you know,
the concept of Appalachians and
[SPEAKER_01]: valuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, if we utilize the same,
you want to say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wilder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wilder.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was it was this idea that that the
French had this incredible appreciation
[SPEAKER_01]: for the land and all these details.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what created, you know,
the wine industry was this incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation for all this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking truth of it was you get into
that 1850 zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was three kinds of wine, red,
white and rosé.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the World's Fair that was in
Paris that prompted the French to realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had the world in their
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might as well highlight a region and
bring forth appreciation for wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did they do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it off the two metrics,
the the price point, current market price
[SPEAKER_01]: point and reputation of the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 70 years later, they define the
AOC, which is your this this Appalachian
[SPEAKER_01]: of origin, where the product come from,
what's the impact of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is most definitely real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regions without question have impact on
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't you can't deny that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and my my point of contention on this
this this lecture I gave, though,
[SPEAKER_01]: was that if we follow that convention
today, right, we follow the French's
[SPEAKER_01]: convention today, then Jungle Boys and
Cookies would be grand crew because their
[SPEAKER_01]: shit sells for the most money in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alien to write most money in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most well known brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: People lost their minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, Kev, you've lost your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like you're an outdoor turncoat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I only have an outdoor farm
that I produce product from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just telling you that these beliefs
that we're holding so firmly today,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we went back, they said, but if we went
back, I said, if we went back,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd have electricity, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have the ability to light
anything up in 1850 or you wouldn't call
[SPEAKER_01]: operating in a greenhouse gas lamp
technology.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like using lighting to change the photo
period, which is all based off the scoto
[SPEAKER_01]: biology, which is chicken production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chicken production educates people on
agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they use to change the lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackout cloths and what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking gas lamp, not electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they didn't have the gas lamp,
you wouldn't have gas lamp technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still wouldn't be doing any kind of
flour forcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they obviously use the technology they
had, which was a goddamn candle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you explain this a little bit better
to me as far as how because I don't know
[SPEAKER_06]: anything about chicken breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what farmers noticed was that
hens laid better under certain light
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, duration of light,
breaking up light patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they call that scoto biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's almost it's a very similar
parallel to me as the parallel to bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So B.R.I.X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the idea of measuring sugar as a
means of determining when a crop should be
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was developed for great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this individual develops the science to
determine when is a grape ripe?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do we harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because remember, we're just we harvest
off all this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no science.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has to be empirical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be through our eyes only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they said there must be a way to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they come up with an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can measure sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they they they run a script through a
refractometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, OK, this sugar level is higher
than it was a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a greater sugar in the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sugar should give us a better end
product because that sugar is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert into alcohol once you apply the
fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the next question was, can we apply
it to all foods?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden bricks based
agriculture is born, but it's based off
[SPEAKER_01]: the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you pick a grape?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it became how do we drive
nutrient density into all these crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: So SCOTO biology is the first step in
light manipulation with plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's it's farmers being aware that
if we manipulate lighting, we can impact
[SPEAKER_01]: chicken production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, someone said, what else does it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do I know who who did that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the idea was it was it born and then
how did it evolve?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it evolves into glasshouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used to call them greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were called glasshouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also called conservatories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all, you know, London, Eastern
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: People with money had conservatories,
which let them grow tropical plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: cold environments because it was a flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole the the wealthy always flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flex at that time was these was
these beautiful maze like gardens and
[SPEAKER_01]: conservatories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it even continued in the US all the
way up into the 70s, with like when
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon Valley wealth started to explode
in the 70s, early 80s, all the wealthy
[SPEAKER_01]: went big on landscaping and then realized
that the next step was winery acquisition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's when you started to see
California wine being touched by all the
[SPEAKER_01]: mega wealthy as wine owners, wine
investors, because it allowed them to flex
[SPEAKER_01]: on something that allowed them to lose
money on the investment, but reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: capital gains on their income.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like all these things that we see have
all these impacts that shape and change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glasshouse technology, they weren't
growing that shit till they figured out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to fucking trap, you know,
heat and UV inside the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't getting flowering to occur or
not getting it to occur without that gas
[SPEAKER_01]: lamp technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we call, you know, the original
greenhouses glasshouses and we call it gas
[SPEAKER_01]: lamp, that means they were using
technology, they were using science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we we we hold these
things in our mind is the purity of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the French created the system,
this was the foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so me and a bunch of these cats that
are that are that are wine based got into
[SPEAKER_01]: this argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a bunch of people that know me
from cultivation got into it saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, you're destroying the world of
organic outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm simply stating that when they created
these systems, it was using the
[SPEAKER_01]: information they had at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to look at it in that same
situation today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever heard about Rudolf Steiner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Austrian architect and also very esoteric
at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was born in 1861 and died in 1922 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he actually is a marker in European
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lived in Switzerland most of his time,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has a center of esoterics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's a and he is like somebody
that this hippie generation that was then,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like in the 60s or 70s here in
Europe, in Eastern Europe also was looking
[SPEAKER_03]: up to like building your own your own
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look for architectural like Rudolf
Steiner or Friedrich Hunderwasser,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the other Austrian, they have no
sharp edges.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they all everything is from
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is like with waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like everything like even in USA,
I think guys did a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: these earthships in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of philosophy to involve,
to go into the nature to to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that that is us actually that kind of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are always interested we will be
working until we die, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, there's no there's no end to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, there is no pension.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like there is no I mean,
pension in the sense that you would stop
[SPEAKER_03]: working on something, you know,
because you you you seem to me like a guy
[SPEAKER_03]: that will be like written in history
books, you know, like something you do
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're infected.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are infected with the virus,
you know, of research economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until you until you die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no there's no way it's
really it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like when I started growing in the
70s, it was outdoor in my grandmother's
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, you know, in the in the 80s,
I get into doing indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the mid 2000s, when we're
allowed to really go back outside because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was some loopholes in the law,
you know, you return to your outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I started to get older,
I started to realize that with
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, if I had the ability to
spend the rest of my life legally
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating, I wanted to do it outside in
a biological system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just purely because there was
so much mystery that remained that it let
[SPEAKER_01]: me be in wonder where when I'm in
technological systems, I'm amazed at the
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity of the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a disconnect that's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd spent so many years, decades,
you know, grinding out indoor operations
[SPEAKER_01]: that I wanted to finish my career under
the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like a complete reversal
of no tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I call it like, you know, natural
tech, where you're using natural systems
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're forced to bend to that
constraint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may only get, you know,
a true vintage year, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: every just like wine 2020, you know,
two out of 10, four out of 10 tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of 10 year period, only two to four
of those are going to be what we consider
[SPEAKER_01]: a vintage year where phenomenal
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that moment in time, the product's
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like coincidentally, this was one of
those years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was one of those vintage years where
this is probably one of the best years of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation we had in the Triangle
probably last decade minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to be part of it was
incredible to be able to watch this this
[SPEAKER_01]: climate just bring out these qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig.
[SPEAKER_01]: But does that mean that I think it's the
only way?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because I like it and I think
that it has a low impact on the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, does that mean that everyone
has to follow what I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole point of me being buck
wild my whole life and running around was
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get told what the fuck to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get told the fuck what to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't usually try to tell other
people what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what we try to do is put
information on the table so people can
[SPEAKER_01]: take from it from the open plate as they
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they want to refute it,
they refute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to use it, they can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it allows us to be able to work,
I think, more cohesively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's what I really
wanted out of the experience of like
[SPEAKER_01]: public cannabis was being able to look at
a thousand different things and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand different viewpoints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all able to kind of come
together on some generalizations we all
[SPEAKER_01]: agree on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some shit that nobody
agrees on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what lets us stay hungry until
we find out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I said this before, but we don't
want to be influencers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to be people that inspire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, I'll tell you how I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're inspired by it, then that's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I wanted to ask you is,
do you know a guy, he's a teacher here in
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonoma County, Bob Kennard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Bob.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send you a video to watch from him.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like to talk about him because he
was my organic gardening teacher at the
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonoma County at the Santa Rosa J.C.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was so inspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: What he told us was that we had to grow
two plants for the earth, for every plant
[SPEAKER_06]: that we grow for ourselves, so that when
you went to his farm, at first sight,
[SPEAKER_06]: all you saw was weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like weeds everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as you walk through the field of
weeds, you see the plants that are
[SPEAKER_06]: growing, you know, basically almost
covered in weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the food that we ate there was it was
like from the Garden of Eden.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while I live in Sonoma County,
I loved growing organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the one that made me realize I
can't really do this in a short period of
[SPEAKER_06]: time in a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's, you know, it's like it's the
Synganic version.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, people think when I talk
about how I don't think you can grow
[SPEAKER_06]: organic in a pot in a couple of months,
they think that I'm a hater of organics.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I just feel like it's a long term
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he bought a piece of land that was in
really bad shape and he didn't go and dump
[SPEAKER_06]: truckloads of compost to grow in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: He built it, you know, using the biology
and by using plants to feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, I just wanted to ask you
if you knew about him because he's really
[SPEAKER_06]: inspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to just send you a link on
some YouTube videos from him because I
[SPEAKER_06]: think you'd enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what got me really
fascinated with simplicity was the one
[SPEAKER_01]: straw revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea that this this Japanese
gentleman changed the entire country's
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to agriculture through the simple
fact of putting straw on the ground and
[SPEAKER_01]: then having chickens shit on it or ducks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you only, you know, and he knew you
only need to have, you know, like 10 ducks
[SPEAKER_01]: for every quarter acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over the course of, you know,
20, 30 years, he ends up adding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, two inches of topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this forever view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got lucky that I got to do I spent a
lot of time with the regenerative groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that it's a forever process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a race.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't like you build this thing and
it's done and it just works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows you to understand that if
you just work towards your goal,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get to it at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the process of working towards
the goal, like everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like whatever we do, the work is what
really defines the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you win a lotto ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You scratch the ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the odds of that are like,
you know, one in four hundred million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very limited chance of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we work towards a goal,
and you chip away, you'll get closer to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you don't get the exact goal,
the process alerted you to many pathways
[SPEAKER_01]: to where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you end up having alternative routes
that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that we as a culture have
become so instantaneous in what we demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't ever want to put the time in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't understand that it's the
actual time that's the gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end product as much as you
think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process changes you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sands off your rough edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like being out in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind in the sand just slowly starts to
round off all the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that worn smooth look is comfortable
to the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that we've become so
instantaneous that we don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that, you know, to me,
you never get to the end because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: get to where your goal was, it allows you
to be able to see other goals from that
[SPEAKER_01]: vantage point that you couldn't see prior
because you didn't have the skills or the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience or the wisdom to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you spend five years trying to
figure something out and you get to a
[SPEAKER_01]: point, you're like, okay, this is how much
I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how much I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're able to kind of figure,
do you want to continue down that road or
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to start a new path?
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that is the world of
agriculture and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just mysteries we don't
understand because maybe we're not meant
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think I want to know
every detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of engineering humans sounds
great because you'll get rid of all these
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll get rid of all these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also take away the very thing that
makes human life valuable is that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live forever, would you appreciate
things the same way?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you grow older, you realize it
because, you know, I got a lot of friends
[SPEAKER_01]: of mine that are dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make sure that you are a little bit
more thoughtful in the interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you make sure that you enjoy these
little moments a little bit more profound
[SPEAKER_01]: because they could end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that when you start to have,
you know, no risk, what's the reward
[SPEAKER_01]: worth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I'm not saying everybody's got
to live that life, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the struggle is.
It's a philosophy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a philosophy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it reminds me of the conversation that
we had before we ever recorded together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I laugh about this now, and I actually
brag about it, is that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: master gardeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said, oh, you said you're a master
gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what I did was now in my bio,
I write Gabby Bronstein or Gabby Staten
[SPEAKER_06]: Island, open quotes, master gardener,
close quotes by Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Kevin Jodry called me a master
gardener.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like one of the.
[SPEAKER_06]: I blushed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's genuine.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I want to say is, yeah, what I say is
I don't want to master anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I said to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like you to repeat what,
you know, what your response was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the master gardener term was
kind of like, well, this means I've got
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing left to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am not going to learn from you
because I'm your master.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and you gave me a different definition
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only did it make me feel good that
you said I'm a master gardener,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it also made made me think about
things differently, just like you did when
[SPEAKER_06]: we had the conversation about,
you know, what is craft cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because honestly, after talking to you,
I think I was wrong, which, like I said,
[SPEAKER_06]: I like being wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like what I thought about craft
cannabis today is different than what I
[SPEAKER_06]: did after our conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: What people do is they they they put
titles on themselves because it makes them
[SPEAKER_01]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all we all need some self-affirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're talking about a craft,
something done by hand, then we can say
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's craftsmen, craftspeople,
and almost all crafts have an evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start out as as apprentice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you're unskilled and you need to be
supervised.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you develop that ability, you become a
journeyman.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're somebody that can work
independently, but you're not qualified to
[SPEAKER_01]: run a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have big picture perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you become a master at a craft,
you have an ability to run a project and
[SPEAKER_01]: educate journeymen who then supervise
apprentices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my family was filled with master
welders, master carpenters, master
[SPEAKER_01]: plumbers, master electricians.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in the military, I worked for a
master diver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that that master diver and
the first master diver I worked for was a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy named Payne?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them ain't Master Chief Payne.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a what an appropriate name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got as hard as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at no moment in time to any of these
people at the master level ever think that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not more for them to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they know is that they're
probably the most qualified in the room at
[SPEAKER_01]: that moment and that their job is to run
the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're a master cultivator,
you're able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a master.
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said that to somebody and someone
said, and what makes you think so?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, University of California,
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking took a program and I passed the
test and it allows me now to do one very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets me communicate agricultural
principles based off of the database of UC
[SPEAKER_01]: Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way what we have is we have
consistent information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do I think that that's the end or be
all of all things?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just that they know that we can
say this because there's proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's why footnotes there are there
are footnotes, you know, when you read
[SPEAKER_03]: literature, there is footnotes and
footnotes means that you go and search for
[SPEAKER_03]: because this information that somebody
writes down has to be valid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people today don't even know
what footnotes are and why they are
[SPEAKER_03]: standing for, you know, sometimes one book
can be I mean, for example, here is a book
[SPEAKER_03]: of bamboo, it's called the big book,
The Book of Bamboo by David Farrelly,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's American guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a it's an encyclopedia where you
have after each chapter, you have
[SPEAKER_03]: footnote, you have like the secondary
literature where you can search for more
[SPEAKER_03]: books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this book is actually the gateway to
like 500 books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which is really specific,
really, really specific, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're taking they're saying that
this does this based off of the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: this person did prior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a respect for others work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not trying to say you invented
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just saying, hey, I endorse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm letting you be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the person who came up with
the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so otherwise, it becomes this,
you know, everyone's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a master.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like people use the word
improperly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in trades, the master
plumber who's running the project doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: say, I'm not a master plumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking title.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like saying, you know,
CEO of the company or you're the CEO or
[SPEAKER_01]: the CFO or the CTO or whatever the fuck C
suite you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your title.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that you're the only one on
Earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it mean you're the best one on Earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're if you're talking
about, you know, somebody running one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these venture capital firms and they're
carrying a trillion in value, I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably a pretty intelligent CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, it just states a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis, to me, if you're a master
at it, you're you're so I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: consider myself a master indoor grower
because I no longer like I study and I
[SPEAKER_01]: research and I work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not where I put my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shifted over to how to plants work with
operations, how to plants work with
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lets me lets me work on what I
like, which is biologically driven,
[SPEAKER_01]: sun grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I want to spend my time as a
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I research indoor and outdoor and mix
light operations continuously so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: understand impact on cultivar selection
and on cultivar performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of figured out where I really
enjoy what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to understand how your operation
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know rivers of people that are far
smarter than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in in all these different areas that
I'm involved in, I just try to be
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent in integrating all these
things simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like my skill set is that I
can pull out of a giant bag and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: together into a ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ability for me to say,
hey, I know someone better in every room
[SPEAKER_01]: is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then what it does, it always makes
sure that you're crystal clear about your
[SPEAKER_01]: level and rank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that isn't something that most people
want to do because you have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with yourself to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have is, I think, a society of
people that unfortunately have been beat
[SPEAKER_01]: down because you're living in the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not if you're not rocking
really nice shit, you don't have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you need you need validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's like with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the big issue where when the
world of legality was coming in,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone in cannabis said, well,
they don't have our skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, they fucking do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, they don't have our genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it that you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have if everyone has all your
secret shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have anything except pissed off
and anger and rage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what needs to happen is you need to
say, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go and tighten up my shit and
continue my educational process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who wants to do that when you're
making lawyer money out of your closet?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough when you when you
incentivize things financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you think you're smart because we
measure everything in money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money is the only thing that can be
anything and everything is measured
[SPEAKER_01]: against.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I try to figure this out a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cash has a really unique position in
the world because everything we do is
[SPEAKER_01]: measured by that pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can become anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So money is this is this flexible bill of
exchange that that doesn't rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: coincidence of wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we use that as this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're making a lot of money,
you don't think you're making any
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, look how much I'm making,
look how well I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really understand that it
sometimes and a lot of times it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even with investment, you get into
something early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that shit again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to find out that you're
not necessarily so good at that is what
[SPEAKER_01]: you thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's earned to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of us got lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got lucky in that I realized in my
late 30s that we were going to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: living shit kicked out of us when this
went legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no question because I was
researching commercial ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to school for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go into you know, like
floriculture, you know, development of
[SPEAKER_01]: potted plants, flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start to really look at those
operations because I get access to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, we're going to get
murdered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to kick the shit out of us
because their level of efficiency is
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the public in America, as much as
people don't want to admit it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're a mids country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would rather have schmuggers bought all
you can eat than 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's America, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rely on it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been we've been taught to be bulk
consumers since birth.
[SPEAKER_01]: For generations now, we've been shaped to
purchase indiscriminately, buy,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy, buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just said, Oh, we're going to get
murdered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been like, Whoa, and it forced
me to start to really relook at what I did
[SPEAKER_01]: and relook at my approach and try to
understand where is my pathway forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I know I'm not going to get to
compete with infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't compete with people that can
raise 200 million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because you raise 200 million
doesn't mean you're going to exist either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while that money is in play,
everyone around you that's competing
[SPEAKER_01]: against you is getting bloodied because
they're able to use the money as the
[SPEAKER_01]: beating tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they succeed, they continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they fail, they go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're trying to if you're trying
to compete with somebody that's operating
[SPEAKER_01]: at below margin and they're dumping and
you can't and the market doesn't give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, the market's like, what,
six dollar weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they people talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the primo shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, America's pretty much
low end shit or we wouldn't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferation of fast food the way we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love we love cheap shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think the what is happening now in
Europe, in Germany, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it will change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The game also in USA, because,
you know, like you are not federal yet,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have certain states have legal
legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, for example, Germany started in
Europe like a like a first move,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in the direction of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many countries will follow,
actually, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in Germany, like, well,
I work, I work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in Germany, but I work in other
countries that provide the German.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we still have our position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at some point in time, when the United
States, when the United States goes
[SPEAKER_01]: federally legal, when the US turns on its
machine, it's hard to compete against.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not China because China can
basically outcompete anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of it is because in China,
you know, the Chinese are brilliant
[SPEAKER_01]: historically for, you know, fuck
millennia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also have very low restrictions
on on OSHA, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Job safety and environmental EPA and OSHA
is a little off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it allows them to be able to have,
you know, competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get into cannabis,
that's going to be going through the level
[SPEAKER_01]: of scrutiny that they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now they're talking like
category four, you know, more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: stringency on the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States has an ability to
absolutely turn on a factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're so caught up in our own
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made so much money for the
government off the drug war that they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't ever want to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're addicted to that drug war money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you wouldn't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of look at it like you look at it
historically in the U.S., right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Methamphetamines in the 70s legal,
you get them prescribed to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, right, when I was like
12, 13, you go to a party, there would be
[SPEAKER_01]: all this methamphetamine in pill form at
the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd have a couple of beers and grab
some of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be wired out of your mind,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit was coming out of your
grandmother's medicine cabinet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit wasn't on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they get rid of the prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do the analogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into like diet pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just begins the whole meth
revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go into opiates, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We schedule all these synthetic opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We schedule a schedule three, which means
they're easily accessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saturate the country to the limit
beyond comprehension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we restrict, same with meth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saturate, restrict, create an illegal
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a drug war we can wage since
the 70s against meth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been the last so many years against
an opiates, but you take a look and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fentanyl crisis is across the country
because people can't access pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: oxy like they once did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the drug war is we have drugs that we
create, we saturate, we remove,
[SPEAKER_01]: we penalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it, I mean, I can point to
a whole variety of different products that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been done with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're addicted to that duality of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make the money on people using
the cash to influence the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: to add that money into the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we want to punish the shit out of
them so that we can keep the prison system
[SPEAKER_01]: moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people catch the American
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't catch it either, but I got a
dude I was in the military with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went on and got into a prison
guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: His family got him into the prison guard
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a good, it was a good world for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did well financially and had a good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he and I maintain our relationship,
but he was saying, you know, I run a
[SPEAKER_01]: cabinet shop and I'm like, what,
for rehab?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, no, we sell the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, how much you make?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, my division in this prison does
180 million a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, let me get this straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the fucking prison in Pennsylvania,
one division of this little prison is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing 180 million in fucking woodwork
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, how the fuck is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, we create the GSA products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We create the products for the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, it's all contract, Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, we make the metal desks or the
wood desk if they put in all the offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, so the desk is like 25,
$30,000 desk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, it's costing us fucking 200 bucks
to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, where's all this money going?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes into the investors that built
the privatized prison industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started laughing because it made me
realize just how fucking undereducated I
[SPEAKER_01]: am about this reality that the American
system of, of, of drug enforcement is
[SPEAKER_01]: really feeding prison systems that create
products that get sold to the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the money chain is so thick and deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll never get rid of this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the U S we just, just like we just
kicked the farm bill down the road another
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on the THCA hemp issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I don't, I don't really care one
way or another how it goes because it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's above my control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea of how they manipulate and
move this, it depends on how much money
[SPEAKER_01]: they're making and who benefits and the
ability to maintain that duality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same with California.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talked to the, I had the,
I had the governor of the fucking state in
[SPEAKER_01]: my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I don't really, I don't know any
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the dope growers that had like every
major politician in their state come and
[SPEAKER_01]: have lunch with them in their office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked him, I said, why do we have
all these, you know, cannabis deserts in
[SPEAKER_01]: California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why are there so many places that
we're not going to be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, it's a capitulation to law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, law enforcement won't approve
legality of cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't give us a go ahead on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll fight me politically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that fight politically will keep me
from being reelected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he goes, so they use their lobby to
control what takes place because the money
[SPEAKER_01]: that you make from drug interdiction isn't
part of your like discretionary budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't get to keep all the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to cut up the pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is they're able to have a
budget that they use, and then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to go and steal as much money as they
can get their hands on that they get to
[SPEAKER_01]: use to do all their other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, they're fundamentally
addicted to the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So which governor said this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gavin Newsom.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that I'd like to see
printed right there, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, it's like he's admitting
to... You can't say that shit out loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you because we have the
conversation in the office.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it out loud or it was privately to
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he said it out of his mouth to my
ear, but we were in my office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's not going to get on a stage and
say that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him, I said, what's the power of
law enforcement in terms of political?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, they have the most powerful
lobby there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, the number of times an election
has been won by somebody who is not in
[SPEAKER_01]: favor of the police group is almost
negligible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost none.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this risk where you have to
support law enforcement so heavily or what
[SPEAKER_01]: they do is they give you a vote of no
confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it states to the public, hey,
we have no faith in this person keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: you safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done such an effective job in
creating that illusion that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the problem with the US is
that we're making so much money off the
[SPEAKER_01]: drug war shit that there's no need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same argument that I got to meet
one of the lead scientists from Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met at an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually had followed me online,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he approached me and said, hey,
I follow your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, and I just wanted to talk to
you about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm asking him, I'm like, are you guys
in weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, and I said, how come?
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, we're global food.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, we feed the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, we don't give a fuck about weed
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, when we get into weed,
you will know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, cause we have a couple of million
dollars a day in disposable money we can
[SPEAKER_01]: spend just on weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, so when we enter weed,
there is no question you will know
[SPEAKER_01]: Syngenta is in the room because you're not
going to fuck with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was no need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, so just not the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, no, it's also the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, if we build infrastructure in
America in a country that's federally
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal, he goes, we could have
nationalization occur and they could take
[SPEAKER_01]: our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a good example of that is,
years and years ago, I had, remember
[SPEAKER_01]: Franco that used to work with the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Franco, he was a sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a lovely guy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a former military, got into
hospitality management, and then he
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes Aaron's partner and they do all
that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he comes into Humboldt County in like
2007, maybe 2008 to see if we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: contract to make seeds for the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was hysterical because he comes to
me and he's like, we want to pay you
[SPEAKER_01]: $100,000 to make seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're laughing because at that time,
you know, you're making that shit a month
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're like, and he was going to make
millions on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking 100,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, look, you got to go to some
other country and go fuck those people
[SPEAKER_01]: over because that doesn't work for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, why don't you go to Africa and
pull that shit there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, we did, but they nationalized
our whole operation and took it from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this risk of working in countries
that they'll take your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so me and me and Franco become friends
and we maintained a good friendship
[SPEAKER_01]: because he was a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll never forget that $100,000
because it was like fucking Dr. Evil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they laughed a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the same deal in that you don't
really understand what's at stake and how
[SPEAKER_01]: many people are making money off of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we see it as it would be good for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not really, if any American
believes they have any value as a citizen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're fucking deluding yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just a cog and a gear and a big
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that at some point when the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: gets involved, you'll see some changes
globally because that's what we do is
[SPEAKER_01]: global fucking business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd be able to, we'd be able to
utilize our tariffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be able to utilize blockages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will manipulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until that happens, we're siloed,
you know, California siloed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't sell to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon can't sell to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hemp is what got around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp is what's letting everything
move.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were to build a business today,
how much money would you risk if you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that the farm bill is going to be
revisited in a year?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the farm bill is going to get
revisited in a year, does that mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have any longevity after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just don't worry about it as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I, what I look at is I look at
countries that can produce product and
[SPEAKER_01]: sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be, you know, in my case,
Canada, South Africa, those countries then
[SPEAKER_01]: I can work with to get product moved into
Israel, Australia, Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just lets me come in and help them
understand how we would adjust the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain and how do we find products that
work in these markets and how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize the production of those products?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can do all of that, then I'm
doing what I need to be doing so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how to function when I get to that
point where the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my whole game with my farm was I
figured at some point we'd be able to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: our product in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I wasn't trying to produce 10
million pounds of flour, I'm only trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce, you know, a thousand pounds,
half a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have such a brutal time
getting rid of it globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would allow the farm to have a good
resonance and let the farm do what I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted it to do, which was produce good
herb because the farm's impact is
[SPEAKER_01]: positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this farm still Port Royal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because that's like the brand name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has another name in terms of how the
county, you know, the state sees it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Port Royal is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the place, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the lip of a caldera, of a dormant
volcano.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the whole fucking caldera falls
off behind me thousands of feet and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: above the fog and I get true south
exposure and I have incredible water
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of that mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I'm the watershed for Butte Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess really interesting shit going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just spent the last eight years
brawling it out with the county over who
[SPEAKER_01]: owns the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So California is obsessed with owning your
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took me eight years to win this
fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they said, hey, in 2045,
we're going to come back at you again and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if you still own the water because
that's what they want is control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that mountain just always produced
really good herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have an emotional connection to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how I wanted to finish
my career was just running that farm up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the edge of that hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and don't give up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't end your career yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need your contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is I want to spend my life
doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not because someone said, you know,
when you retire and I said, what do you do
[SPEAKER_01]: when you retire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you get old and die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, I want to continue with
my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just comes down to what your desires
are and also to understand your reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the reality of your existence?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kind of got to be comfortable with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the U.S., the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're able to work in any other
country, then you can start to practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start to get the experience you
need to be able to understand what's
[SPEAKER_01]: needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is these more highly regulated
production methodologies and distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies that are required and what
works in these markets and what doesn't?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you optimize supply chain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mean, I'm having a great time
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's worked for every company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies that I did the work for in
Canada succeeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies I did the work for in South
Africa succeeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just lets you practice and play and
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, I don't sit here wondering
like what's going on in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mean, our whole our old cannabis
system basically collapsed, which is mind
[SPEAKER_01]: bending that Michigan is making more tax
revenue than California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's it's almost it's it's people
like I'm talking, no, no, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: you understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing against Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan is a beautiful place and they
grow some really good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're talking about economy,
you're talking about California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fifth largest economy on earth,
L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: County by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That six million people cluster is like
top seven, top eight in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just broke L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: free from the rest of the United States,
it would be in the top 10 in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: global performance financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're we're over here down in like one
hundred eighty seven, two hundred million
[SPEAKER_01]: tax zone when it should be in the
billions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a total mismanagement of a
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the nature of what we're
where we're at today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that I just quit
complaining about the lack of fairness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, fuck it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I love growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, I can at least enjoy what we
have, which is the ability to do what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're I'm fucking lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about dope growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just it blows my mind because
you remember when you first started out,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I never wore a weed shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no weed shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I changed clothes and cars and spots
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never looked like anybody that would,
you know, arouse suspicion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were living under cover so much you
didn't have a normal life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the only your only friends you hung
out because if you hung out with regular
[SPEAKER_01]: people and they found out what you did,
a lot of them would get so fucking mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized it wasn't because they were
anti drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because you exemplified freedom and
the idea that me, a regular person,
[SPEAKER_01]: could have a life better than you,
where like I don't have to go put up with
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it patty cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't got to go play patty cake at work
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most people, they didn't really
get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to play the go to work,
put up with the boss's shit, work with
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy ass coworkers, get paid minimal,
suck up 40, 50 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimum of your life a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have a weekend off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't afford to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going on vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I'm over there flying to Hawaii
during the middle of the week just so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can get out of the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like we had a pretty good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made people upset that and to me it
was they were upset because I was just a
[SPEAKER_01]: regular guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like they were mad, you know,
and it's the difference between envy and
[SPEAKER_01]: jealousy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jealousy is boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And envy is like how come that prick has
that jacket?
[SPEAKER_01]: One is you want the thing and the other is
you're mad at the person who has the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we had was really envy over our
lifestyle because we didn't have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the ability to take a Tuesday off
and go to the park with your kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I when I wanted to go to Europe and
travel around Europe and do stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I took my kid with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When when my son got the opportunity to go
and get invited to Russia to train with
[SPEAKER_01]: the national team, I could afford to
fucking fly him.
[SPEAKER_01]: When my brother got opportunities to
compete globally, I could afford to fly
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like we had privileges that regular
people didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were angry because they did
everything they were told and they
[SPEAKER_01]: followed the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did all the right shit and it wasn't
real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that are dying to this day still
won't use cannabis to help with the issue
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the stigma that's been put on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I just I can't I can't
change the world, but I can I can try to
[SPEAKER_01]: be decent to people in person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you want to be an inspirer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, not influencer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could influence anybody and hopefully
be influenced children to be nice to other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if when I see my kids being kind to
other people and when I get the report
[SPEAKER_01]: card and I see the good grade of nice to
other children, polite and respectful to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people, I know I did well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the other shit really is just you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you're bright, you're fucking
bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm somebody that did well academically or
I do well in those situations because my
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking brain works well that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I got to struggle with other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the things that I'm really proud
of is the shit that I don't do that well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had to work so goddamn hard to get
good at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's if you're laughing because you
like to no one else is at anything high
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to you, you basically started out on
your hands and knees and now you can run
[SPEAKER_01]: and know you're not the fastest runner in
the world and you're not trying to say you
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to you, you know damn well you used to
crawl on your hands and knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's those type of
internal victories that give us
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're fighting the struggle on
your own and you're doing things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're very different to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't attack them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for me, when I look at like online
trolls and shit, I laugh because if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: spending your time trolling, I'm like,
oh, you're a miserable motherfucker in
[SPEAKER_01]: real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can see thousands of your
prolific, I'm just like you spending your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole life online talking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means you're not doing anything in
your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a really good indicator of the
quality of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that unfortunately many
don't have, they haven't found yet a place
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you're happy, you really
don't give a fuck about other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to get in their shit and
fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it when they troll me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I even help them because I'm
like, you're not trolling hard enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you some more info.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know for real, you don't have to laugh
because I'm just like, I ain't worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shit doesn't matter to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the internet fucking blew apart today,
I'd still be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd still be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd still have your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm still doing what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the electricity went out,
then I'm cracking seed and I'm doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: only in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what, it'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just really bending to that
reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a beautiful attitude you have,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the power went out, we'd still be
cracking seeds in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what, I'm doing what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't get so caught up in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just know that if I spend my time in
rage, I can't turn that off and be with my
[SPEAKER_01]: kids and my gal and my animals and my
friends and be positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And positive just means you're not
bringing negative shit with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do a thing, say a thing,
be a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You enjoy the small things, the small
moments, the real moments.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what life is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the nuance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we talked earlier about,
this forever life or the thing was
[SPEAKER_01]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with cannabis, it made me realize
just be grateful you experienced it when
[SPEAKER_01]: it was at its peak and be aware that the
things you see today are gorgeous also and
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're seeing them at your peak and
that when they change over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not that our memory is faulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that there's change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like going back to your neighborhood
where you lived in a place that was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You come back and now it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been cleaned, it's been gentrified.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to places that were good and then
they become bad in the way where they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been gentrified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cleansing of gentrification helps
bad areas, but it also removes all the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just enjoy it while you're in the
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is one thing I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Rashomon, the perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody sees the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Rashomon, you have your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I live in Europe,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have these grapes here because I live
in a vine producing area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about it in the last podcast,
a few podcasts ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is called the Isabella, the grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's called, it's very sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big blue grapes or big white grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a really certain,
certain aroma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a cut which is like the Vapa
cut from Paradise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has this aroma, you know,
like the grape, the Isabella grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last time I listened to the podcast
with Not-so-dog and Crybaby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Crybaby told like in one moment,
you know, the Europeans, they don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: how skunk smells because they don't have,
you know, we have skunks here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we don't have your skunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: In USA, you have those skunks that you
call skunk and we don't have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually realized that I never
smelled skunk like you would say it's
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know that what this smell is
skunk for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else is skunk for me,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a different, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for example, in my area,
everybody that smelled in the 90s that
[SPEAKER_03]: started, the wheat, indoor wheat started
to be present in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that smelled indoor wheat said
it's skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if it's hay,
or if it's not hay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not matter with the type of
genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody says indoor wheat is skunk,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is still today, the slang word skunk,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like the word amnesia for the hay in
Amsterdam where everybody forgets the
[SPEAKER_03]: wallets and they don't know where the
hotel is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's why it's amnesia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's hay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super silver hay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that word came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like right now, gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas to us implies petroleum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It implies this petroleum-like aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to kids today, gas just means heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gas can be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we say it's gas, someone goes,
yeah, this is gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, that's not gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, no, it's gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're using it, it's connotation
denotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what the word means and what we
believe it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these arguments are that
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody gets triggered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the internet, it's funny, but the
internet creates a situation where people
[SPEAKER_01]: can get triggered quick and then instantly
call you a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call you a name right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this is so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I wonder what you're like in real
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can guess what he's like in
real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't allow there to be real
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, the problem with that is that
there's so many people that lurk,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're online, but they lurk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never get involved in the discussion
because they don't want, it's not that
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't know what they're doing either.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably the smartest people in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't want to get caught up in
the dispute.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to get engaged in more
drama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I do my best to not get caught
up in not getting engaged in drama,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I just don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we can go at me all day long,
but yeah, but when you happen to attack me
[SPEAKER_01]: personally, especially if you don't know
me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know me, but you're attacking
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, you're just looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best thing that anybody can do is
basically ignore that person because it
[SPEAKER_01]: destroys them because all they want is
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they post on their own
platform, nobody looks at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they fuck around on yours,
they get engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny you say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows them to be able to feel
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody needs to feel good in the way
they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the problem is what we do is
we dissuade people that don't like drama
[SPEAKER_01]: from entering our space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's like the issue
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at cannabis and it's the same
thing where, you know, cannabis was this
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely diverse industry, incredible
amount of diversity in every aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when you take a look at it,
it's almost no diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't care what equity
program they create, it's still run by
[SPEAKER_01]: basically a bunch of white guys like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though I fall under the equity
guideline, meaning multi-time fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: felon, it's just not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take a look at the number of
women that are in the industry and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: minuscule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you have is you have this
filter that basically filters out people
[SPEAKER_01]: who want to get in, who don't want to deal
with all your bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just want to get into a new
career.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought that being a cannabis would
be something positive, being around people
[SPEAKER_01]: and can't be positive, but that's not the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's cannabis consumption and
then cultivation, meaning that you're your
[SPEAKER_01]: own cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing at your house and I'm
growing at my house and Slava is doing at
[SPEAKER_01]: his house, we can all have a conversation
about growing and feel the goodness of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're not trying to monetize that
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the minute you monetize it,
all of a sudden it changes it dramatically
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cannabis industry, the fucking
mess, no diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, and it's not healthy and you
can see it because it's so narrow band and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's overall with, we have a million
different categories, but at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, that it's a very limited
selection, be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin, a very simple question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next season, what, what are you going to
grow next season?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, genetic wise, you know,
cause you obviously are high profile guy
[SPEAKER_03]: for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really interested what you will say
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you were going to grow next season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I, I know what I'm going to do on my
own, meaning like I have a, a,
[SPEAKER_01]: an Afghani cherry pie that I did some work
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And went through and selected out a
stunner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to see that as a rosin
product hit the market because it just
[SPEAKER_01]: threw down, but it threw down a product
that just shakes you like almost,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost unpleasant level strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to see that get out into the
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the, the people I smoked it with
just loved it, but I'm lucky in that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce product without white labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can produce product that I don't have
to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can produce it for a company,
but I get my name on the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm, I work with cookies on that
and I produce varieties that come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the R and D facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the team tells me what they would
like to see produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I produce those products and we turn
those into fresh frozen and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they go into the cookie world as a cart,
but it's a great relationship because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: my label.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, it's not like I'm bought
white label and I'm actually getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: full credit for the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ability to do that is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, um, only the most respected
breeders and cultivators will get that
[SPEAKER_06]: honor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, because also putting your name on
the bag is bringing up the brand at this
[SPEAKER_06]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for both parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, you know,
the farmers have a hard time getting their
[SPEAKER_01]: product into the, into the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I can produce a product and get
it into the store, that's a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I like to be able to just do what I
want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grow what sells and then I can work
on some stuff that doesn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I have one question I want to ask you
before we go and then we do a wrap up.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so one question I wanted to ask you
was your thoughts on breeding and
[SPEAKER_06]: selection of males.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, and I'll just give you my quick
feeling on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel like I have the experience to
choose a male.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that in many, for many people,
I think it's a bit of undue arrogance that
[SPEAKER_06]: they have that saying that they can select
the male because how do we really know
[SPEAKER_06]: when like a female, you can see it,
you can smoke it in advance.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what you got a male.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making your best guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, the best way to do breeding and
it's difficult is, you know, if you have
[SPEAKER_06]: many males, you cross your females with
them one at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you see what comes out from male
one, two, three, four, as many as you can
[SPEAKER_06]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, but you know,
people are like, well, I did a stem rub or
[SPEAKER_06]: I reversed this male and made it fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like, how can that actually tell
you what you're going to get?
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like choosing one male is
arrogance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is if you, you're going to select
down to one though, because sometimes one
[SPEAKER_01]: male is the only male that carries the
traits that moves on into the project.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's after testing all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, what I do is I look through the
population of males and if it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be open population preservation,
I'm using every male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's trying to be selective,
then I need to choose the males that have
[SPEAKER_01]: the traits of interest that I'm attracted
to mostly and then see that they pass that
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes, you know, you go to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem is that when you go to
do breeding work, what we do is we chase
[SPEAKER_01]: current money where we're like,
oh, it's hot right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth of it is, is that what we
want is we want to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, the thing that I'm working on has
real value period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now it takes away the time frame and
it lets you say, okay, it's going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: me a year and a half to really figure out
what do I want to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and once you start to work with the
line, you can start to notice that certain
[SPEAKER_01]: traits come along with it where the plants
that have these profiles seem to have this
[SPEAKER_01]: odd leaf anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants that have this trait seem to
also pass this trait on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll start to see odds, a propensity
for things to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only way you can determine
anything at the end of the day is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is through testing the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, you know, working on
marker assisted stuff is that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to say, look, this plant,
we've identified the trait of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where it exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can find it on this plant,
that means that plant has the potential to
[SPEAKER_01]: pass it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that trait doesn't exist in the
plant, there's no ability to pass it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most, most breeding is kind of,
that's why I say it's kind of half ass
[SPEAKER_01]: because we don't we don't go at it from
this comprehensive view, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that we haven't created some
beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, we don't have a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a cluster that we select from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal is to be able to put as much
into this line as possible so that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you fuck with the line, you get a large
portion of that pretty desirable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I appreciate that response.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I think we will wrap it up
and let Kevin get to his family and to his
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did want to say, I did want to say
again, I don't feel like we've even
[SPEAKER_06]: scratched the surface of your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some guys I want to introduce
to you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think I love your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's, oh my god,
people that would love to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get back on it, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grady, I appreciate you both of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_04]: Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_04]: and seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are the only place that you can
get the Gabby Staten Island collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
