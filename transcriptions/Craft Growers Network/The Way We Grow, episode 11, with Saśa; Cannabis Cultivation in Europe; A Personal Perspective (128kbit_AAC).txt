[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the way we grow podcast production of the
[SPEAKER_01]: craft growers network I am your host Nick
wolf today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guest is Sasha the Slovenian Hobbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show Hey, man Nice to have
you Yeah, no, it's great to have you back
[SPEAKER_01]: as a guest You've kind of been a great
co-host for Gabby and myself over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of this Podcast as we've started it
up and providing a different worldview
[SPEAKER_01]: Than what we have You know, where can
people find you on on Instagram before we
[SPEAKER_01]: get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complicated for US citizens to
find me actually because my Instagram name
[SPEAKER_00]: is Gartenswerk dot by dot heretics Which
is actually Gartenswerk is a term in
[SPEAKER_00]: German, which means a garden dwarf the the
caregiver of your garden, you know Like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in German culture There is people
who have a lot of people have these
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and they have this little dwarf
hidden inside of the garden somewhere He's
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding, you know, I I actually few years
ago I did it purposely when I open up my
[SPEAKER_00]: own company that I wanted to target the
German speaking market Actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not interested in US market at that
time or any other market So I purposely
[SPEAKER_00]: did it because I'm small guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little beard and I have like
ponytail and You know, I'm a I'm a I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: dwarf, you know, I'm a garden dwarf So
this garden dwarf is Gartenswerk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will open up I will open up a
account now very soon I think before this
[SPEAKER_00]: video goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be Slovenian Hobbit so this will
be me will be my picture and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened the rock two months ago with you
guys for me still I live in a place that
[SPEAKER_00]: is Very much illegal to flower cannabis
You can grow it but you cannot flower it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, right so that kind of area and
it's very interesting times for for
[SPEAKER_00]: Decriminalization and legalization in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's it's it's going up and down and
it's you know when you look to Germany now
[SPEAKER_00]: in this moment is very Very very difficult
situation because we don't know in this
[SPEAKER_00]: moment If they gonna make it illegal again
They are talking about it that they will
[SPEAKER_00]: forbid it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I cannot even Think about how
how can this you know, how people we go on
[SPEAKER_00]: the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a Riot, you know, this will be
this very problem because they allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: people to grow at home three plants They
can possess like 50 grams a month This is
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Germany Yeah So now the because
of the government is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's like the they are You know
building the government which is not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not Going well now and now the the parties
are on the rise which is actually against
[SPEAKER_00]: the legalization So they want to make it
illegal again Sure, which is impractical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it's possible to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No But let's see Okay, and I will not talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have guests who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Vincent wheat was on the on the on the
show a few weeks ago We will do another
[SPEAKER_00]: show with him in soon so he maybe can tell
much more than me But I hear something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because I'm in Austria,
but I live in Slovenia But I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: business in Austria with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are quite depending on the German
market also so it's like Maybe in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot ship anymore there again That
would be crazy that would be really
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will keep you updated about this
definitely so for sure Well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that you know, you have this
Awesome clone business where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: selling unique genetics that are sought
after in the European market From some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our previous talks and so I would
definitely suggest the guests go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to those So that we don't have to
retouch on too much of that here because I
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to get into your growing style
knowing that you Are in a completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different market than what the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is and that you know, you have some let's
call it past experience with growing
[SPEAKER_01]: flower out, you know in different
scenarios and settings so What were some
[SPEAKER_01]: of like so I always like to start this
show with talking about some of your first
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences with plants And I do feel like
we talked about that before but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't mind kind of taking it back just a
little bit for some of the newer listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: and telling us a little bit about your
Your personal history with plants where it
[SPEAKER_01]: all started and how it evolved into
cannabis or if it evolved from cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: into you know, a desire to grow vegetables
or other Other things in general just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of take us a little bit along your growing
story Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually that you mentioned if vegetables
were my first inspiration Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I grew up in a garden of my
grandmother which in that time in
[SPEAKER_00]: Yugoslavia and timed it was in the 50s 60s
she everybody after the Second World War
[SPEAKER_00]: grew food at home because It was you know
After the wars normally everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed all the economy is gone So
you're depending on your own few meters of
[SPEAKER_00]: garden to have Maybe better food than you
know, you can do what you do So I grew up
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very beautiful beautiful garden which
my grandmother carried so much about and
[SPEAKER_00]: she she gives this knowledge to my mother
and my mother also to me but my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother actually was more of a because
you know, I grew up and my grandmother
[SPEAKER_00]: still alive and she actually Let me play
in her garden all the time and I had to do
[SPEAKER_00]: work also, you know my first experiences
with with plants is potato tomato salad
[SPEAKER_00]: You know herbs a lot of herbs I have you
know, my grandmother even let me have my
[SPEAKER_00]: own patch when I was like five years old
That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she she said you remember what you
grew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah carrots It was carrots and some salad
one tomato nice But you have to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that in these times you we did not Buy
seeds all of the seeds were made by my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother for that sure you took you
take because this heirloom Varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know where we know that this is a well
into my but at that time We didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: about anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just take you have one variety of
tomato or two maybe and one variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: carrots one variety of cabbage one variety
of of potato or two maybe sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot, but all of these were very
stable and they performed in the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the terroir, you know, the it was the The
stuff that grew here for 50 years already
[SPEAKER_00]: before right they select they selected so
much it was acclimated to it was Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and this is also the basic knowledge
for cannabis after Okay, we are talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it right now because this is the
basic knowledge how you select Because
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor growing, you know, you have to
understand until 2003 I'd never saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah From my childhood from the end of 70s
Until the 2003 I never saw a plant grow
[SPEAKER_00]: under light never okay always under Some
always which are with all the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: which means very good soil Very good soil
means for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on a river very near a river and
the river bed You know when the river this
[SPEAKER_00]: river is very big and it's not controlled
hundred years ago and it went You know it
[SPEAKER_00]: how you say it flood a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like overflowed overflowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it is a lot of sediment the river
is alpine river it has a lot of magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium a lot of iron a lot of trace
elements already in the water so it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: and The river is like few meters away from
my house here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big river.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a yeah, it's called Mura and yeah,
so To go to cannabis then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like growing up in a garden in Yugoslavia
at my grandmother's place You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have also we have animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had rabbits We grew I mean one of
very near there was a butcher here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like There is a lot of you know,
it's like a farm, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I saw a lot of reality in the beginning
food production was for me very very
[SPEAKER_00]: normal When I was 10 years old I knew
everything You know about food about food
[SPEAKER_00]: about the plant to to the ripeness of a
fruit and Produce that fruit or even if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not vegetable, it's meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw everything, you know Traditionally
in Slovenia at that time when I grew up we
[SPEAKER_00]: used to kill two pigs and in the in the
winter time like no and As kids we were
[SPEAKER_00]: all there, you know to see that,
you know how an animal was opened and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything Was taken out and all the meat
was used and every part of the animal was
[SPEAKER_00]: used Really every part not a lot was
thrown away So It is like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when you grow up in this kind of
environment that you actually use
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you produce yourself and then
when the first cannabis came when I was 13
[SPEAKER_00]: years old, you know and because it was not
It was that the first time you smoked or
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time that you saw it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first time I smoked Okay was when I was
12 or 13 years old Okay, and then because
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it is a flower and it has seeds
inside For me was of absolutely the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I did was take all the seeds and
plant it sure I wanted to see it once,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was 1993 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Yeah, so I planted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course something grew but you know
in the beginning was like, you know 1993
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 1994 I Got seeds from my cousin
And he got it from a guy that came from
[SPEAKER_02]: India Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have a lot of land races here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like yeah Everybody that grew
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it Doma cheats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, which means the machine's a homegrown,
you know, okay Doma means Home,
[SPEAKER_00]: right like a missile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like this is homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So homegrown means you did it yourself on
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the Doma cheats I was really
like the average week with what maybe five
[SPEAKER_00]: six percent THC only Yeah, sure,
but it was land-raised but already
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So then in 96, I got some seeds from
Amsterdam and those Were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we grew all the time from 93 to
96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you are you are you 16 now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were born in 1980?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nineteen seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But the thing is, you know in the
last podcast I told you about Mongolia was
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 21 when I was Yeah, like 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was in that moment when you asked
me about didn't country real But I was 21
[SPEAKER_00]: years old when I was in Mongolia But when
I was 16, you know, I left, you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to high school here in Austria I
mean I was born in Slovenia, you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: Yugoslavia and I went to primary school in
Yugoslavia and Then the war came and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were our own country Slovenia with a
separate country not a was loving anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then the high school came and high
school I could go to Austria to high
[SPEAKER_00]: school for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went Over the border after after high
school you you graduate with Matura and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can go to study to university
Yeah, so I went to Ljubljana, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Slovenia, you know, okay So I was
in Austria and I went back to Sweden now
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back in Austria again for my company
because they they allow growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: until you flower But let's jump back here
the the before anything came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam The things that were grown here
were very Phenotypically very different
[SPEAKER_00]: from each other and all of the stuff was
grown outdoors in compost You know compost
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening style that we do, you know when
you do vegetables when you do everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else You know how to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with economies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same code that the plants speak
the same language definitely, and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming you're doing this in some sort of
either like raised bed or Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like hugelkultur Sort of like Well tilled
or well cared for yeah plots of land or
[SPEAKER_01]: little patches of earth Yeah, so yeah like
Europe you're applying compost to
[SPEAKER_01]: replenish all of your organic matter and
making sure that the microbial colonies
[SPEAKER_01]: they're healthy and you have good
vermicompost activity in there and So,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean yeah, but then still you know,
then still it's from plant to plant It's
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know the same plant in the
same bed One will perform one will not and
[SPEAKER_00]: why because they have a different
background for feeding, you know They have
[SPEAKER_00]: a different background from parental side
and then they have because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this different demand for the
food an OG from Pakistan You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I say always that the OGs come from
Pakistan Afghanistan region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Afghanistanica It is not Indica not
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not through the rallies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Afghanistanic the the base of
this Family of plants it has it does not
[SPEAKER_00]: demand a lot of nitrogen It does not but
if you lack calcium magnesium and iron
[SPEAKER_00]: with this with this OG related plants You
always have problems OG OG always want to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed on the trace elements so much and my
assumption is because it's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: these regions Where there is not a lot of
nitrogen at all in the ground nitrogen You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, there is a lot of other stuff with
nitrogen is not so much present.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not yeah, you know so with other
strains like sativa related or more to the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator, let me say and Of course a lot of
rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because everybody knows equator is
volcanic activity is high So you have even
[SPEAKER_00]: the trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have this composting which is
really all the time There is like layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: compost there, which is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah microbial microbial life always I say
to people when you know a plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors planted in the ground Not in the
plastic container but outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground It is like communicating with the
with the base again, you know and There is
[SPEAKER_00]: like this tale of you know, there is
enzymes and they live in these cities You
[SPEAKER_00]: know the roots go and there is cities
around those roots and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cities are producing for example There is
enzymes there and these enzymes go to work
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plants one day says to them today
today I need a lot of zinc and they go to
[SPEAKER_00]: work and they Gather the zinc and and the
mycorrhizal it's transporting the zinc to
[SPEAKER_00]: the to the veins and it's going off to the
plant Yeah, for sure the neck the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: the same or the other or other,
you know organisms are Trying to get iron
[SPEAKER_00]: or trying to get Molib then or trying to
get you know You know sulfur for for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, but it's what the plant
tells those Things it comes right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah in Yeah, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it makes so much sense in a Like in
it in a limited amendment sort of way
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're you're kind of just
maintaining a We we've talked about it
[SPEAKER_01]: before with other guests where if you look
at an organic Substrate that's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: high in organic matter you have sand silt
and clay as your main constituents of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil right and then you have whatever else
is in there whether it be like leaf litter
[SPEAKER_01]: or more organic matter if there's any sort
of like pumice or Stones in the soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: allow for drainage, you know a higher sand
percentage in your in your soil you have
[SPEAKER_01]: this like battery and the the more that
you care for it or the larger it is then
[SPEAKER_01]: that like battery has like a Greater
potential for the plant so it the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: can tap that Battery and get all that
energy it needs Even though it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the nutrients that supply for the the
energy cycles from the Sun, but it's It's
[SPEAKER_01]: a I feel like it's a good analogy to look
at it where you are Like you care for the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate substrate takes care of the
plant versus in like a hydroponic setting
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to make sure that your
hydroponic Nutrients are correct and that
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH and the EC are where you want it
and then your irrigation practices are in
[SPEAKER_01]: place Not saying that you don't need
irrigation practices in place for
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're in like this Like
directly in the ground, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: oversaturate and create some muddy or
anaerobic condition No exactly and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: very good point because people ask me when
they come to my facility and they see They
[SPEAKER_00]: see the mother plants like grown more than
six months Like sometimes I have two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in a one a liver liter pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we Have one gar animals clone,
which is also from finest, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: American clone We put two plants in
11-liter container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows up and it's you can get a lot of
clones like that, you know, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed it a lot and then people ask me
how do you do that, you know, like in
[SPEAKER_00]: every 11 it because they are looking like
trees really dark green and I mean dark
[SPEAKER_00]: green green as lime green some strains has
not to be Too dark because then they are
[SPEAKER_00]: too overfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to you have to know your strains
to know that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark green are normally the OGs that I
have in my company and but the lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: green are more the sativa ish the plank
and you know, the big but and yeah But but
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing is with feeding Which people
always forget is that the roots need a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of oxygen If you grow in soil,
which is actually a mix of light mix what
[SPEAKER_00]: we have which is speed based a Lot of
perlite is inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually very near hydroponics
already because it's not this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil what we used to do because we
need for production and If I would grow at
[SPEAKER_00]: home and when I do I never do any Leave I
do living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do live not a life soil,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, but in but in the company where
there is a schedule and protocol and It's
[SPEAKER_00]: a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to this big scales, it's a total
different story It always people are
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting each other against you know,
if you're organic or you know Ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: grower or if you are a hydro grower and
chemical, you know but but actually it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not right to to actually It depends on
your environment and depends on your
[SPEAKER_00]: demands, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's setting dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just say that one style needs to
work for everyone That's a little no
[SPEAKER_01]: Centric I guess I it just doesn't really
work Because yeah people have different
[SPEAKER_01]: demands in their gardens and they have
different desires for their outcomes So
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't just say that one is the only
way to get it done But let's take it back
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit so Because I want to I want
to kind of learn about your transition
[SPEAKER_01]: from you know It sounded like you had your
one outdoor crop a year of whatever was
[SPEAKER_01]: growing there and save seeds from it grow
some more Maybe get some seeds in from
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so what was your first experience
then when you really went into it with
[SPEAKER_01]: intention where you were like I want to
make sure that I get really good flower
[SPEAKER_01]: out of this and was that in an outdoor
setting or Was it in your first indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: setting and then, you know kind of talk
about the transition between those two and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you what you did as a grower,
okay Until I went to study in Ljubljana
[SPEAKER_00]: for you know to study I studied German
language and literature and Germanistic
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professor for German language,
which I don't do now what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is when you go to study To
university you have you know, I had time
[SPEAKER_00]: in your life that you will never have
again Just doing your study for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Chose this and I went to live for six
years for free, you know to be free travel
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever I want It was easy living cheap
living a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a lot of friends all around the
world It was really good time so in this
[SPEAKER_00]: time I Realized that people grow for
example in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this guy who grew indoor wheat
and I saw that in 2001 I never saw in the
[SPEAKER_00]: in the wheat and heard about it,
but never saw it Because we grew so much
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, but even before that,
you know It is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growers, you know, because we come
from rural areas We live in very you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of forests and a lot of
patches and We were guerrilla like you
[SPEAKER_00]: call it guerrilla growing did this what we
were And today is like that that still
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of people exist and are still my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provided clones also for my facility
These people are still living this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: way and through this kind of people I saw
That thing what you asked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you realize I realized when we
started to buy seeds from a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar and then try to find Between
those seeds to try to find Something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would like to have again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so those people already Cloned so
cloning was on the end of the 90s 98 I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I saw cloning right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but we did it for outdoor first We
didn't flower indoors but indoors under
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it first time in 2001 I saw it What
was your impression of that when you when
[SPEAKER_00]: you first I was I was blown away It was it
was purple wheat what they saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I first first thing that I saw on the
lights It was really purple wheat really
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was shaman by Dutch passion the strain
Okay, which is actually a outer strain and
[SPEAKER_00]: we we used to grow it a lot of other after
that But those guys already had the moms
[SPEAKER_00]: and during the you know in the winter time
when the the month is not there for those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones They were flowering them indoors
Yeah, so they already made those
[SPEAKER_00]: selections and I actually saw that they
they did it like, you know from few packs
[SPEAKER_00]: they popped they have this numbering and
then Fewers the winners, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they were reproducing reproducing
all the time and you have you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy wheat from them you have the same
Wheat for years, which is like you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat and it's the same and you buy wheat
It's the same you buy another wheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: half a year later It's the same because
they were doing the clones and that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: we realized it's it's standardized and the
story standardization Standardization of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is very much good chosen,
you know, somebody that choose really good
[SPEAKER_00]: at that times It was like you could be the
master of ceremony, you know people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the whole so you you know the
Whole concert scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in music business man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right whole people everybody knew
about the strain because everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it it was like so Prevalent,
you know the when the amnesia the Shiva
[SPEAKER_00]: super silver haze cut came.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so obvious It's like smelling like
incense stick all around, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like yeah So when when you first
encountered this?
[SPEAKER_01]: realization of this of the standardization
by using clones and and reproducing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same environment and you know reproducing
in an indoor environment rather than in an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor environment where you know If you
get one crop per year, maybe you use a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of clones for it But the quality of
that product one month after harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: versus ten months after harvest is going
to be pretty different and you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: know that as a consumer as well just as
the different Progressions of if it was an
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor crop versus an indoor crop where
then in the indoor crop, you know you get
[SPEAKER_01]: Four or five four or five different
harvests a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're maybe having stuff
That's three months old at the most four
[SPEAKER_01]: months old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and and so you have a much higher
level of like a standard of what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting So when you when you experience
this where were you at in your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: career?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what were you doing at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the thing is what I want to tell
you is like a friend of mine was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: already But which is Californian orange
skunk for a long time like six years in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row Through from seeds all the time brown
buying seeds and doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So in the first two years,
he had really good crops But I mean the
[SPEAKER_00]: the the weed was the same almost like
really that all from seed all from seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it changed he bought the same
packet pegs somehow the weed was Not the
[SPEAKER_00]: same anymore And it was not depending on
the season of the weather it was weather
[SPEAKER_00]: the weather was the same but the quality
was lower and He always relied on seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: always the seed form of it always because
it's stronger plants It has a better root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stronger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has better root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more Strong in sense of against its
predatory in the sense of No, no issues
[SPEAKER_00]: with We call pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's much more like that if you have
a good line But if the line gets bad and
[SPEAKER_00]: you sell it as a producer, which is a big
producer in Europe Actually today very
[SPEAKER_00]: well known company That you do that and
most of those companies are like that If
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not a small breeder anymore,
you don't have that anymore because they
[SPEAKER_00]: already Rely on white label production,
which means it change You cannot have in
[SPEAKER_00]: your menu hundred fifty strains and tell
me that you are producing them in house
[SPEAKER_01]: that is absolutely impossible the HVAC
system alone to be able to handle all
[SPEAKER_01]: those different pollen sources without
there being any potential of
[SPEAKER_01]: cross-pollination is a little bit
ridiculous you're talking about like a
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-million dollar facility alone just
to be able to have the infrastructure in
[SPEAKER_01]: place to handle that and Sure,
there might be like lab grade facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: in different parts of the world that are
seed producers, you know that produce like
[SPEAKER_01]: row crops, right like wheat or corn or
other things like that where it needs a
[SPEAKER_01]: high level of standardization and Safety
protocols to make sure that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination But no one's doing that with
canvas seeds like you can't You wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to find the backers for the
infrastructure for something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: just due to the legality reasons Yeah,
because you're still producing flour Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know you asked me when I did
realize, you know, I realize you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: my crop got stolen in 2000 And my father
called me I Was in Ljubljana study,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know with my guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a radio journalist I was watching a
radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad called me like, you know,
hey, I remember the day I was crying He
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me your Durban poisons are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trees at home here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even got I Was crying man on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my dad called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was crying also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That's how we were, you know,
like we were depending on this shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know We have a crisis in you know,
there were some heroin junkies in the town
[SPEAKER_00]: here, you know They needed it,
you know more than us, you know They were
[SPEAKER_00]: stealing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but all those these guys are already
gone You know, you know because karma
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back and you know, they're not alive
anymore these people but You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that time that people come to
my place to steal my ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to Move to another strategy to
get the ganja done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we moved indoors and me and my dad made
indoor room and I Flowered in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: from 2003 till 2019 until when I opened my
Facility in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's keep it as anonymous as we
need to or you know So I have a few
[SPEAKER_01]: questions though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this the first time you grew indoor was
this before or after you saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: High-pressure sodium setup while you were
in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew before because we used to make the
cloning We go to the clones and we put
[SPEAKER_00]: them under artificial, you know CFL lights
sure, you know to grow them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first experience with
growing but I you know it was like Just
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe one two years just to prepare
the plant a little bit before you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: outside to not flower To not flower to too
soon in the season, right if I get them in
[SPEAKER_00]: March I have I can put them out in May not
not in March because it's too cold and The
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time would be too late to too
short.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that yeah already because we we
read the books, you know, like Some some
[SPEAKER_00]: guy have this Connor Clarke book Okay,
one one other guy had Horta Cervantes book
[SPEAKER_00]: some other guy had at Rosenthal book,
you know So you just cross-referenced it
[SPEAKER_00]: found out the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we found out because it was no
internet So we also had to be like these
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this grow magazine, which we have
also But there was no internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no phones man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like right for Season to season we
saw more than this this when the magazines
[SPEAKER_00]: came and this internet and everything We
already knew that you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you already know that from
experience because you see it all all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time And then you were like, okay I'm so
interested because other people have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same experience like overgrown,
you know, I was watching man It was like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my community was overgrown,
you know, because at that time you have
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody to talk about it sure and then As
soon as you see someone else write
[SPEAKER_01]: something down that you've already been
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh it confirms it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell Yeah, I was doing yes and has a
picture with it, you know, right like and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have like a good explanation versus
the Anecdotal evidence, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like even with like the
photoperiodism of the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying you can't just throw
a clone outside in March Even if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a good climate your lighting depending on
where you are in the world you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have You know pry close to 1212 lighting
and you're gonna initiate flowering in
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're gonna go into a revegetative
stage of the plants and then it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: flower out again and you know Some people
might say oh that way but it works with
[SPEAKER_00]: some strains, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not it's not the method to to
rely on no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah No, we've even found growing outdoors
that sometimes we'll just we won't start
[SPEAKER_01]: the outdoor plants until you know late
July
[SPEAKER_01]: You just throw the small clone out there
and it has two three weeks of Vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and then boom flips the flower but
also has like this robust amount of root
[SPEAKER_01]: growth at the same time You get this kind
of synergistic Growth where the roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorous the upper growth is vigorous and
you get these huge plants from nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and the best have no time to to to be
you know, that's another part Less pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen that when you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes late late July crop like you say That
you put out side vegetative state clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really hardening, but then it's
like much less problems Right much less
[SPEAKER_01]: less pressure overall because if pressure
builds up on a day by day basis and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can only do so much through spraying or
applications of Beneficial insects or
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise, you know before it becomes
either cost prohibitive or too late in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower where you don't want to affect the
final product then you know if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: adding on a Month or two that's a lot more
pressure to be built up and one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: we've also found is sometimes your your
yields can almost be the same in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: cases depending on how Close you're
planting if you're doing like either a row
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants with some sort of drip
irrigation or something You know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have them At a five foot center like a one
one and a half meter center between plants
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have You know if you give them
those extra two months of growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna just grow into each other in
the roots as well They're gonna sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have now limited space to grow and
their yields aren't going to be like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, if you if you have Three weeks of
veg versus two or three months worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna have three times the
amount of yield No that extra veg time and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna have all the extra pest
problems like you're talking about So
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something that you know as a as a
grower I always thought you know if you if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing big plants outdoors You
need more a lot more veg time and in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases sure but in other cases,
it's almost not advantageous You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very simple to make a giant plant
Actually, it's not it's not difficult You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's like you put it all you've
sprouted in February and then grew it in
[SPEAKER_00]: inside as if you can and then in I saw
that in March they already put putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them in tunnels and they are prolonging
the light of course for six four to six
[SPEAKER_00]: hours you have like HPS lights that give a
little bit of heat and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you may they already have these big
plants which actually then outgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: everything there, but actually man,
you know how much waste it is to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is only for the eye to do
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not economical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not economical It was in the time
when in America you had this plant count,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that still do yeah Well,
and it's also if you look at it from like
[SPEAKER_01]: an agronomic standpoint as well the the
nutrient assimilation from the grounds to
[SPEAKER_01]: create this huge plant all this biomass
like the actual Yield from that total
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass the percentage Or like the
fraction of the total biomass is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot less than if you have smaller
plants with really healthy robust growth
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the the fraction of that total
biomass that's going to be your end
[SPEAKER_01]: product is going to be way greater in a
smaller plant Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't it doesn't make sense,
but it is impressive You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see these people like the Mendo dope
boys or these different groups that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're gonna grow the world's biggest
cannabis plant and flower it out and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like alright, you know, like that's fun
actually, but it's not It's not like a
[SPEAKER_01]: production purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a production purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, definitely But I mean I appreciate
everything some people do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know over the stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you saw that man?
[SPEAKER_00]: They they grow something over stone like a
bonsai It's like fun it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that is some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like that but it's not yeah,
it's not like Monocropping in a no setting
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce a bunch of flower No,
no, you know what is very very much
[SPEAKER_00]: important what I wanted also to touch on a
little bit the quality of the water that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are using is I Think this is
something, you know when you see you need
[SPEAKER_00]: light you need soil and you need water You
don't even need soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what the medium is it can be local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can be yeah, so But the water
quality To bind the nutrients in the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah Aerated water living water Drinkable
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we have a lot of luck here in my
country where I live especially I mean My
[SPEAKER_00]: place is like you drink the water,
you know, it's not so it's drinkable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not that good as in the mountain
region They have it from the tap man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah drink it drinkable water everywhere
here It's so good that it's drinkable from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy bottled water ever here ever I
don't buy I have bottled water here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's we're on this well and the electrical
conductivity of our tap water is 1.7 So Oh
[SPEAKER_01]: my god, you might have 950 parts per
million or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 0.4 From the diet man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just blows me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god So we want to use it for cooking
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh The thing is with water and the
people don't realize here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How easy it is to grow Actually,
the water is drinkable water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can drink it the plants will drink
I have always have to put a pH minus here
[SPEAKER_00]: or always because of It's it's 7 so I go
to 6.3 6.2 for the for the pit based
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and when I do cloning on rock wool
and on Easy plug which is speed based I
[SPEAKER_00]: for the pit based I do 6 0 6 6 1 and for
the rock wool I do 5 7, you know when you
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you have to with rock will have
to always do a pre soak for 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum Because you know the rock wool
itself has a pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put it in water, it has to
balance out this pH So the water is I put
[SPEAKER_00]: in five point zero when I from my tab I
have to put five point zero the water to
[SPEAKER_00]: put in direct rock wool So next day when
we come to work to do the cloning,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's five point Seven five point six five
point eight, you know the rock wool and
[SPEAKER_00]: you do this pre soak And it's working fine
But I already also saw that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the medium only Yeah, so the water is
so much important what I want to touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: that the water quality will bind the
nutrients and You have a lot of more play
[SPEAKER_00]: room to do with this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a water EC of one point
something from the tab, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have a lot of room, you know
Because you have to know what is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water already, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't add it, you know This here
here is like I I like I know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: economist likes a lot of iron Right many
don't many people don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean don't know don't talk about they
know but they don't talk about That iron
[SPEAKER_00]: is as much when they always say calm mark
calm mark calm mark You can add calm mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the If lack of iron comes then no no
calm mark will help you No NPK will have
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing will help you right because there
is locks, you know, they should lock down
[SPEAKER_00]: All of all of these trace elements are so
much important to know about them and to
[SPEAKER_00]: be careful what kind of medium you're
working on and to be kind of aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: with some cultivars you need to add them
with some maybe don't need to but You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's it's dependent a lot of this
because people always think that some
[SPEAKER_00]: brands of Fertilizers don't work all of
them work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple to do a fertilizer You
know, you make it you make it from scratch
[SPEAKER_00]: actually or had told us already how it's
you know, it's very easy to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer but To make to make a good
fertilizer and to balance it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so you know speaking of fertilizing
and Kind of the grow style in general so
[SPEAKER_01]: when when you and your dad first then
started having to grow indoors because you
[SPEAKER_01]: were worried about losing your crop either
to theft or I don't know if you had any
[SPEAKER_01]: other sort of crop failure just due to
weather or otherwise before that but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know indoor growing kind of does limit a
lot of those issues or potential issues
[SPEAKER_01]: and so what was Your first setup like it
sounds like you used Some of the CFL bulbs
[SPEAKER_01]: that you were already using to keep your
veg plants alive that were going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor garden Yeah, but when you when you
first set up your indoor garden for
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, what did that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your media?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you decide how to keep your
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertilized whether that be through the
medium as a like a living soil Did you
[SPEAKER_01]: just pull some soil in from one of the
beds outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I mixed my own soil first,
you know I knew about that the soil but we
[SPEAKER_00]: did not buy soil at that time We we mixed
our own and that means I bought some
[SPEAKER_00]: pit-based stuff In back everything must be
sterilized, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could not take some good compost
from outside and bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so My secret additive was warm compost
warm driplings from from red worms Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they sold them here for like a 50
litre bags or 20 litre bags And we mix
[SPEAKER_00]: this inside and we mix the guano the the
bird and the butt guano inside and You
[SPEAKER_00]: have to understand that was 2003 2004 2005
and we let it sit For two weeks before we
[SPEAKER_00]: planted and we were not putting them in
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were putting them in beds So you had
beds inside we have beds inside man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were these beds built out of they
were built from It was plastic bed it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like you can buy it, you know You it was
like this plastic container which can hold
[SPEAKER_00]: on each side and you can carry it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew we just drain hole But it was like
we put two or three plants in one bed sure
[SPEAKER_00]: and we saw this technique With Soma,
you know Soma Amsterdam Soma seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote articles for the German Magazine
and he has this that has don't use pots
[SPEAKER_00]: use the beds and so the the plants connect
with the roots and We had clones already
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never put seeds in indoor In the
beginning we have we have this access to
[SPEAKER_00]: these people my friends who having this
standardized clones, right the Supersunk
[SPEAKER_00]: the Shiva in Ljubljana the friends in
Ljubljana, which is not actually from
[SPEAKER_00]: Ljubljana But all of them are from all
around Slovenia, but are in Ljubljana
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are students sure and All of
them are living every from the mountains
[SPEAKER_00]: from the seaside from the you know All of
these are still my guys still growers
[SPEAKER_00]: still doing their shit still still Really
good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them my family, you know So still
it's like You know some growers and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: not talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask me What was the light man at that
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could only get HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not or MH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah metal halide for the vegetative time
and HPS Yeah and after they put out the
[SPEAKER_00]: Phillips Put out the awesome awesome put
out a light that is can be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative state and the flower stage At
once they do need to change it anymore We
[SPEAKER_00]: use that one, you know the awesome now pay
for Epsilon something it was 400 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, you know, and then we change to
600, you know, and we use the old Trafo,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the magnetic one the really heavy
sheet, you know, you cannot carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so heavy We use that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, you know when the first
ballast came that are Digital,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were so yeah, it's so light
man You can carry two of them in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands because otherwise First of all,
the ballast man was so heavy and it
[SPEAKER_00]: started to broom after two three years
when you use it it started to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: song It's like broom song, you know like
And it is not good sign because it uses
[SPEAKER_00]: more electricity for less efficiency Yeah,
you see it is always and then you know
[SPEAKER_00]: when the the light came to with we saw the
Keramic metal halide, you know the Keramic
[SPEAKER_00]: cm Did what we tried this it was good for
vegetation but maybe not for flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I Never went into it so much that I
could tell but I saw it and I worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit And now I work with lead
lights, you know, it's a it's so cost
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient to to the HPS I still have HPS
at home somewhere hidden, you know when I
[SPEAKER_00]: use it maybe one, you know, because it
produced a really really good flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it has it had its own qualities even
if it's 40 year old technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're um, what were some of those
first harvests like that you that you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your dad had Not so good the first I mean,
but it was clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like we instantly knew something
is wrong Okay, you know because we saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: product from my people and we saw it from
indoor and from outdoor and we saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: Same plant like it how do you hate and
then we wanted to reproduce it like them?
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was like The first round was a
disaster and you know, what was the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation I Was going to ask yeah,
we did not put the strong we then on the
[SPEAKER_00]: second round We have it was like a
revelation sure even this the second round
[SPEAKER_00]: was so much better It was so much better
than anything and then we tried to Keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this level for some time and then you add
a little bit more and we we adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: wing the you know the wings were better
because before we had these small ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: sure cool tubes and Fucking shit,
you know some shit like that at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: from round to round from strain to strain
You get better and it was like we have
[SPEAKER_00]: five Crops intercrops a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm So we were like, you know each year
five so ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 50 crops Yeah, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 75 crops right, you know,
like after hundred crops You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so like when you When you first
noticed that you needed more ventilation
[SPEAKER_01]: did What were you seeing and some of that
in that first crop were like did you did
[SPEAKER_01]: you realize that they were like heat
stressed or Was it was it a humidity issue
[SPEAKER_00]: or was it both it was it was like a
condense was starting to Put the walls
[SPEAKER_00]: were condensing, you know dripping
dripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man It's like what the fuck you
know, cuz my dad was like I said to him
[SPEAKER_00]: Like ventilation, but he got some small 20
watt, you know think like small
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation what this That is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you have to understand at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot get just into a grocery You
know, there was no grocery here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You have to get this shit, you know,
like even the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no carbon filter the first two
years The room like 90 degrees a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent humidity the first yeah,
but then the second man it was already
[SPEAKER_00]: like 50 60 the percent of humidity and
Temperature wise was much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a heater then and then everything
went much better And the ventilation after
[SPEAKER_00]: we because we were very focused on
ventilation because one time in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year I think we get powdery mildew right
and we need First time I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I saw it on wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what Powdery mildew is and you know
how we cure it at that time with milk We
[SPEAKER_00]: we we have farmers here who have cows so
when you put 100% cow milk on Processed
[SPEAKER_00]: milk you diluted 10 to 1 You spray your
plants with it and the powdery mildew is
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard that as well,
but but it's really Stinky it's so stinky
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to repeat it ever in my life
ever so this you spread this on your
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor plants and Yeah, and then it yeah,
you just had like rancid milk smell It was
[SPEAKER_00]: like yeah, but the crop was really good at
the end It was it was I mean we have just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of powdery mildew We sold it
and after that we really got into what was
[SPEAKER_00]: the Reason with the reason was that we got
the powdery mildew with a clone that we
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired from Graz from our facility It
already had that because other strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know with the powdery mildew plant the
New York City diesel plant was like
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning on the st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sistar plant Which we had no powdery
mildew, but the the New York City diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was like white It was like somebody
would put flour over it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like so this is so this is the the true
story Of how sour diesel was created then
[SPEAKER_01]: right you just took New York diesel and
sprayed it with milk and let it go sour
[SPEAKER_00]: But but this clone you New York City
diesel at that time it it was Produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma But it has nothing to do with your
sour diesel or nothing to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical or nothing to do with anything
like that It just like version of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were trying to get close to yeah,
but I think Soma just made up a name,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know for specific specific cut he made
Soma is a great breeder for other stuff I
[SPEAKER_00]: know but for this cut, I mean it was very
Specific weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it was so smelly that this shit
when it grew I mean it was it has so this
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma was like I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean people in Austria will know about
that cut It was in the 90s and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s New York City diesel cut It it
was I was puking, you know like The aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: the aroma was like every whether you like
it you don't like it I'd never like I just
[SPEAKER_00]: got one clone one time and it had powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It infested my crop It was like not good
relation with this plant with me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, you know, which something I
don't like right but doesn't matter I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that Some people liked it because they
produced it and it worked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my place it was infested with with
PM so I saw PM then and I from that time I
[SPEAKER_00]: was really Trying to you know fight
against PM all the time, but it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about the VPD the vapor pressure
deficit Powdery mildew has no chance if
[SPEAKER_00]: you create an environment that is not
possible to connect to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am I like to explain to people that
powdery mildew is It's a mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a it's just it's just like other
fungal Organisms where you need a Wet dry
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle as well as like a hot cold cycle in
order to sporulate the the the mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: spores and so if you think about it like
the The forest floor right where you would
[SPEAKER_01]: get edible mushrooms or something from if
you are out foraging You're gonna have all
[SPEAKER_01]: this leaf litter on the top of the forest
floor So below that where the mycelial
[SPEAKER_01]: colony is is growing it's gonna be cooler
It's gonna be wet right and then when it
[SPEAKER_01]: pushes up its fruiting body above the leaf
litter on the floor it's gonna be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: drier and a little bit warmer and so if
you have Cold wet nights and dry warm days
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have this sporulation event
in your grow area where you're gonna allow
[SPEAKER_01]: for because because powdery mildew spores
are everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna be able to produce
powdery no spores unless you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: completely sterile environment with like
HEPA filters and UV filters and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you but if you're creating the
environment for it where it's like wet
[SPEAKER_01]: cold then hot dry then wet cold then hot
dry you're gonna have all these spores
[SPEAKER_01]: just love and life because they're The
mycelium can grow at night and then it can
[SPEAKER_01]: spore it can produce its fruiting bodies
in the day which produce more spores and
[SPEAKER_01]: then those sporulate at night and then
they produce more fruiting bodies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day so it's just unique, you know why
actually because there is this spore this
[SPEAKER_00]: spora on the leaf the you know,
when you look at the microscopic way of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf it has this spora and it has
stomata stomata and it has wax around the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata when you have this dry hot instead
of wet cold The the wax is dry out and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's crumbling and it makes the leaf
susceptible for the spore To connect to
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf it can end it can enter the plant
through this gate after that's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: point Yes, you always notice when you have
a really good steady VPD like because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you want a temperature differential
Day and night, but that means you also
[SPEAKER_01]: need to adjust your humidity day and night
so that the overall Vapor pressure deficit
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of remains Uniform day to night
without having too much fluctuation you
[SPEAKER_01]: can have some but not a lot But when you
have that limited fluctuation and all your
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters are set you get that awesome
Waxy cuticle where the the leaves are
[SPEAKER_01]: shiny shiny straight and they never have
healthy and happy Yes, you can you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: it on like tomato plants too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like a really nice healthy tomato
plant is gonna look waxy and shiny and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you know if you Allow for that tomato
plant to maybe go too long or get
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthy then you start to get powdery
mildew on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah Yeah, it's very very similar
things where yeah vapor pressure deficit
[SPEAKER_01]: is huge and it sounds like you had a huge
experience early on to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: ventilation is one of your friends if you
don't have like air control or air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning and Air-handling systems like
that For example, you know you in my
[SPEAKER_00]: facility when I moved my first facility to
the second one when where I am I always
[SPEAKER_00]: have this this calculation in my head I
have to remove the air from the room eight
[SPEAKER_00]: times an hour I Can be able to do that
eight times or ten times an hour if I can
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the whole air space There to change
it then the VPD is okay, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It never have problems Well before we get
in to too much of what you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: currently I just want to wrap up a few
questions about kind of some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier experiences with indoor settings
So did you run this living soil that the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate that you would create?
[SPEAKER_01]: And put into these beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you ran the entire time that
you did your home growing or did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Move into hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Never did hydroponics instead of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it But the other the stuff was at
that time I had no You know, it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that you have to learn and you
learn by mistakes sure always always you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn by mistakes and Because if you
cannot question something that you did
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong What is the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have to ask what is the
problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this thing and the always is your
fault?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get rid of the of the ego
think that somebody give you a sick plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the plant was in the beginning
when you got it it was already Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetics must be it wrong Wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's always the growers fault
first of all 99% right let me say like
[SPEAKER_00]: that So let when you go through this
concept then by mistake You make all the
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes You you don't you know with and
then of course when you cultivate clones
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of seeds you always have the same
plant and With the same plant you can
[SPEAKER_00]: masterize the process very much quickly
very much better because this plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: always the same genetic material Of
course, it's depending on how the mother
[SPEAKER_00]: was cut and how was yeah, the clone
sometimes is better Sometimes it's worser,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is the same cut So if you're good,
you have your good environment even from
[SPEAKER_00]: very very bad clones You still can make
really good plants if you put all the
[SPEAKER_00]: dedication into it and take time and Don't
rush things, you know so actually it is
[SPEAKER_00]: always been a lot of a lot of Empiric work
that means grow grow grow all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor outdoor, you know I was doing
indoor but in these times man,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were doing outdoor too because sure to
do to do Indoor in the summer was never an
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it would you'd need this all this
sorts of air conditioning and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have this air conditioning We
don't buy this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I mean And you know all the
crops That I got from this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know from these years I tried many
many many different genetics from Austrian
[SPEAKER_00]: clone market, you know, I buy I mean There
was there was so much genetics that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, trying did the Austrian clone market
open up like when was that available?
[SPEAKER_00]: around 2000 Even before yeah, it took 25
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, yeah, but it's so long,
you know, actually the clone market is
[SPEAKER_00]: that yeah my guys before that are we're
working on it already, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't get those clones from
Austria, but they made them themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's but in the sense of the Austrian
clone market is so big now and We don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get too much into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't want to talk about it too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like I'm a part of it You know
Gartensberg production by heretics is a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it We are quite a big wholesaler
now and people know us and genetics we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to represent them and this is the
story how I got to those Genetics actually
[SPEAKER_00]: because without all this work when you ask
me as a home grower to see all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: clones in the market I could not I could
not even have any Ability the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about the genetics It is like for me
when you say to me orange, but Orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is the same shit as Californian orange
skunk tangerine dream tangy Everything
[SPEAKER_00]: with orange orange punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all based in the same family of
plants the parental genome Sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: or purple earth, you know the earth We
have a clone which is ice cream runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's like purple earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same It's the same thing a little
bit variation of it, but it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as purple earth It grows the slowest
plant to grow ever Produces very dense
[SPEAKER_00]: purple buds very spicy No issue with mold
no issue with pests outside performer
[SPEAKER_00]: totally, you know that how you know the
plants because Through the years of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing as a home grower years and years
And trying different cultivars until you
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make your own crosses Of course,
you know you end up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you make your own crosses but then
you know, it all ended for me when I You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I have a family man I have to kill
children and I have to feed them and the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is that I needed a Real job,
you know, I mean I was working a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I we didn't talk about that, but I was
Involved in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved into theater but big
theater, you know I was translator for a
[SPEAKER_00]: very big director who was working in
German market We were doing very big
[SPEAKER_00]: productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stayed I was paid very good there So
I could actually be a home grower and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know coming from a production and living
for six months without a problem From that
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after you know Then it turned out,
you know time time tells so now I started
[SPEAKER_00]: my own company in Austria And after that I
knew that I have to quit flowering Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the story that how I stopped
flowering I know it's like yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started a legal business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to stop Yeah, let's talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean as someone who I I think cloning is
one of the It's such an essential stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis lifecycle if you're growing
for production and The different methods
[SPEAKER_01]: of cloning All seem, you know,
there's ones that work really well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then there's some that might just be
You know like a home grower Clone in a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple plants here and there where you
know, they they can be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: laissez-faire They don't necessarily need
to produce the nicest clones but with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the standards that you You've mentioned
before on previous shows When dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the European market where you have a
Different regulators coming in and telling
[SPEAKER_01]: you how you have to do certain things and
certain precautions and standards that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have in order to ship clones over
a country borders, which is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I feel like a lot of American
listeners will kind of be blown away by
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's just something that's part of
your regular business model How did you
[SPEAKER_01]: develop your grow style and what are some
of the things that you do there that you
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are some of the things that you
do there that you feel are working really
[SPEAKER_01]: well for your your cloning operation and
Where do you feel as though there might
[SPEAKER_01]: even be some hindrances due to these
different regulatory bodies that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: beholden to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is To transit to from home growing to a
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very big thing you many Growers who
are home growers now, maybe think that
[SPEAKER_00]: their model of home grow could work in a
big facility Normally, it's not The SOPs
[SPEAKER_00]: are so, you know, we go out from home grow
and you don't have no experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: industry And actually I did work for some
other people in the industry here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have no SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all It was all Anarchy,
you know Yeah, I've seen like and I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: that and I didn't want to work for them
anymore No, and I opened my own sheet and
[SPEAKER_00]: I created my own system, you know And the
system is like that that you keep mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants of specific strains specific
cultivars That is actually personally
[SPEAKER_00]: connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I am that is My opinion is is very
high quality one from the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: already because they were really selected
for years already they were not a Clone
[SPEAKER_00]: from last year what I got in my company
from my people, you know They were like
[SPEAKER_00]: already close that they're like eight to
ten years old at that time And now they
[SPEAKER_00]: are like almost 15 20 the world,
you know, it's like and the thing is I did
[SPEAKER_00]: not go to the Australian market and get
clones from other shops and open my own
[SPEAKER_00]: business with those clothes Because
normally people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 90% of people did that and that
curated your own library.
[SPEAKER_00]: I curated my own library, you know Of
course, I got a few strains which I got
[SPEAKER_00]: from from a library That is in Austria
also, but this is a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it was it was classical
strains Which I needed for my customers at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time stay still I need but now I have
additions which I only I have and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that they have those Strains they
got it from me and I have no problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: it when they sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not of course It's a free world man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want, you know, it's like I'm not
I'm not having no problem with that with
[SPEAKER_00]: you Resale the genetics that I got Of
course, it is sure it is like that
[SPEAKER_00]: compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's compete with quality of the of the
core clones Then you know how it's rooted,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how the mother plant how you
shape it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you how you produce it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that I tried in the facility
that I was working before I opened my my
[SPEAKER_00]: my own facility with the business here is
Although they all also used hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I am not really professional in I'm
really more professional in sense of Pete
[SPEAKER_00]: based stuff and soil cocoa mixes and You
know mother plants which are grown for
[SPEAKER_00]: like half a year or seven months and then
I change them all the time I don't I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow old mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have my own mother plants
to be old and woody And it is woodyness is
[SPEAKER_00]: not a good thing With clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you saying you you still keep
mothers around for six months or you've
[SPEAKER_00]: lowered that time now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I I still have some strains you can keep
for six months Others you can't I mean to
[SPEAKER_00]: have us you can Obviously you can keep
them for years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some some shops did like when I start my
business some shops had mother plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: a year or more They were also bragging
with it It's really funny to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: it to knowing what we do know now about
how soma clonal variation and Like
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen buildup or other buildup of
Exogenous sources on the plant that are
[SPEAKER_01]: causing it to express differently than its
unadulterated genetic version,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say and how those can build up over
time in older plant tissue and How I've
[SPEAKER_01]: even worked for some people at one point
that they you know They wanted to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: mothers around for as long as possible
because the idea behind it was that that
[SPEAKER_01]: mother the clones they get off of it are
going to be uniform to the product that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were used to growing and that Product
changed over time because that one mother
[SPEAKER_01]: was around for like a year and a half,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the clones you were getting off of it
at 30 days out from the transplant versus
[SPEAKER_01]: you know 360 days after the transplant
they're gonna just be lacking almost in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit And so they thought that they
were doing it to keep the genetics at a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific level Whereas using healthy
growth and recreating new moms
[SPEAKER_01]: successively And you know on a regular
schedule keeps the plant in more health as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as you're choosing your healthiest
clones from those batches and and Making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you're taking care of the the
mothers and the root system of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: so that they maintain health And so,
you know as someone who does have to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: plants alive and to keep these genetics
You know in a sense stable Where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, very consistent results with the
clones that you're shipping out What are
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the practices that you're using to
maintain those mothers at a very healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: At a very at a very healthy growth as well
as water and then from there talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: some of your cloning Practices that you
feel as though create your best clones
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Mother plants as I said not to be too
old but not cause them too early for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know You have to call them for structure
for sure but some of those Clones are like
[SPEAKER_00]: like you saw this these big steams and you
think it's gonna be the you know Some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them you can root very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them you can't It depends strains
because when you keep like 35 different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars It depends it depends on
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So But the thing is normally it is very
simple Don't do not over water your moms
[SPEAKER_00]: My first rule do not over water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important That's something that
a machine doesn't know a pump doesn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: when to stop pumping, you know That's why
I have two gardeners for the moms Two guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that are paid for their jobs to do that
like every third day, you know and even
[SPEAKER_00]: before they have to go through because
Regular checking because we have different
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes of pots, but do not over over over
water your mothers ever because if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that It's a very big big, you know to two
steps back yeah The the second thing is do
[SPEAKER_00]: not keep your moms too old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third thing is Experiment with
different mediums when you clone for
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we just we just realized that for
example very old cutting from white widow
[SPEAKER_00]: very old cutting a new cutting from
America the ice cream runs are rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: much better on rock wool instead of Easy
plug easy plug is a pit based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but rock wool is rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grow down The grow down has its
advantages, but you have to keep a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: pH for the grow down then then for the
Rock then for the easy plug it to
[SPEAKER_00]: different mediums different strains react
better in different mediums also maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: many producers talk about it a lot,
but when you have a variety of exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like me have like You know all the
American strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work much better in easy plug now
than they do on grow down, you know for me
[SPEAKER_00]: I use yeah, and I use now very Experiment
now with different kind of rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones Okay, I use I use powdery rooting
hormone, which is phosphorus actually
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is actually for I buy it here in
Slovenia and it's actually, you know for
[SPEAKER_00]: all kind of cuttings, you know for soft
for half hard stems and for woody stems
[SPEAKER_00]: you can Root everything with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's called core X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Correx or core X core X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah The producer is in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we use now a one that is clone
91 We got this product clone 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like ethanol, which is like
strange thing I use it first time last
[SPEAKER_00]: week to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is It is liquid liquid and you
can root, you know before you plug them
[SPEAKER_00]: You have like a handful of clones and you
put them in to soak for 20 seconds Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we try this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always tell people never be Because I
work with different stuff a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: until you know, I try something else and
sometimes you never be To stop born on
[SPEAKER_00]: something that okay something works But
don't be stopped born that only this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the it and over because that that that
goes into a narrow point Sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not available, you know, you want to buy
the material that your production goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not there It's like what what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what should I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know sure you have to have a second
pathway, you know to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, this works, too So all the time you
have you have a solution, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to I like to Point out to
people what some of these active
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients are like in rooting solutions
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll usually have It'll say IBA or end
all three butyric acid or maybe NAA which
[SPEAKER_01]: is naphthalene acetic acid and you can
find those different components in other
[SPEAKER_01]: products and you can look for the ratio at
which they're put into your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: product and either dilute to that ratio or
Find something with a similar ratio or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe just like you're saying try
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be too stubborn to not want to try
something else because a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, especially when it comes
to horticultural practices like Cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been cloning plants for over a
hundred years at production levels and
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world and There's plenty of
information out there on what to do for
[SPEAKER_01]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Being stubborn in one way is yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't you can't do that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did experiment I tell you this in
my facility We did the guys did experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: without any rooting hormone at all To plug
it into the easy plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it, you know 50 of those we did
without hormone 20 rooted Without hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: just because the mom was so healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right the plant itself, but with with
hormone Almost everything will root right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's well and even like it like the IBA
and the NAA are just different Oxins and
[SPEAKER_01]: cytokines right and those are already
produced Indogenous Lee in cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for yeah, you know apical growth root
growth all these different things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're like applying them to That you know,
it's already It's already there we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: applying extra to try and promote
something and so yes, that's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to know that there's different
ways to get to it and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you asked me before you know about the
agencies come into your facility to get
[SPEAKER_00]: The paperwork done for you that you have a
European blood passport of the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and Those agencies are actually
there to have an insight and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: control Over pests and diseases that can
occur on the market, you know and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a I have actually very good relation
to them and I work with them closely for
[SPEAKER_00]: exports which is outside Which is European
exports?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to to to extra to talk to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I export outside of Europe,
I have to organize a meeting and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to come to make you know, always is a
different if one country demands something
[SPEAKER_00]: that they need to step inside they will
always sure it is the paperwork Is done
[SPEAKER_00]: like if somebody from outside of Europe
wants clones from my facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple You give me an import
permit and we did this import permit I go
[SPEAKER_00]: to to August to this agency and they come
to my facility and Go through this import
[SPEAKER_00]: permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have what is the demand on the import
permit?
[SPEAKER_00]: from this demand They will check all the
facility and even beyond of that And you
[SPEAKER_00]: know if the demand is checking for all
kind of viruses they it is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did it So it's it's it's a deep
scan People call, you know, you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: to me genomics stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have this kind of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all valid valid, but it is also Very
unaccurate also on the same point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not distinct the the
standard for shipment outside of borders
[SPEAKER_00]: of continents, let me say It's much more
different standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it has to be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to spread pathogens or
invasive species or other things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: that could potentially harm crops or other
Like native species of plants or other
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that can that can be devastating and
so it's you know, there's a part of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the level of bureaucracy behind that much
Oversight I'm sure can be a hindrance in
[SPEAKER_01]: some people's eyes, but then the ability
to also help prevent Issues like
[SPEAKER_01]: catastrophic sort of events potentially
from occurring Like could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's just say something with hops
late and viride right if something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that entered into a market where there's
like a CBD manufacturer and it somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: makes its way into That facility due to
mislabeling or something from lax
[SPEAKER_01]: standards it could It could ruin,
you know destroy let's say it just ruins
[SPEAKER_01]: one crop, but this crop is over a hundred
thousand acres or something that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy amounts of wasted resources and
wasted time and all these different things
[SPEAKER_01]: that could have You know gone into a
productive crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's I think it's really valid
to have stuff like that, especially When
[SPEAKER_01]: you are shipping over country or continent
borders, which is something that again I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think that a lot of people in the US
market are thinking about how much
[SPEAKER_01]: standardization and Oversight will be
required if something like that were to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen It's already it already happens if
we are shipping other production crops
[SPEAKER_01]: that are through some sort of clonal
tissue like whether it be like apple or
[SPEAKER_01]: Orchard crops things like this oranges,
you know all these things that are they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're single cultivars, you know,
they're cloned on to existing root stocks
[SPEAKER_01]: or you know it's a whole market in and of
itself that has extremely high levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oversight because it you know you if you
ruin something like the orange market it
[SPEAKER_01]: not just ruins, you know the the
capitalistic sense of it where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody gaining money from their oranges
anymore, but you also lose a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: potential Nutrient source for however many
millions of people that that would provide
[SPEAKER_01]: it for so it is It's important,
but it requires so many different angles
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at Yeah, but it is Actually,
you know that these agency people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: officials government officials That's a
very helpful people for my facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you know, I always Followed
their advice their advice was for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was shipping to Israel one time few
years ago and They told me That two years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago one Austrian farmer Tried to ship
apples into Israel And just just apples
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, right apples apples man and
all the apples When they arrived in Tel
[SPEAKER_00]: Aviv Were destroyed Because they didn't
ask this standard as they didn't pass the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard and what was the problem he told
me because it was like when I contact them
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have from Israel the inquiry,
you know and They give me the import
[SPEAKER_00]: permit So on the import permit there was
listing of stuff that I have to check for
[SPEAKER_00]: before I send it Man that was like a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a list It's when we talk
about whole plate and virus and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: not only whole plate and virus There was
stuff written there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is stuff written there all viruses and
as I know like tobacco virus Latte and
[SPEAKER_00]: something virus then mosaic virus from
some different mosaic virus again sure
[SPEAKER_00]: some like beat Curly top virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like Every fucking thing that
is possible to check for they they wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to have it checked And we did that then,
you know, and actually he asked since he
[SPEAKER_00]: told me that the thing is why the apples
were destroyed from this farmer because He
[SPEAKER_00]: was using Some stuff for prevention,
you know some oh You know like a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: or something that was allowed in Austria,
but not allowed in Israel Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big one Yeah, yeah, this is like
thing is that oh wow He used that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I hit for you They give you this
checklist what you are allowed to use and
[SPEAKER_00]: what are not allowed everything you get
every share These are really documents man
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like you have to go through and
you have to check what is actually on your
[SPEAKER_00]: market because most of that stuff On the
list is not there on your market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have To find stuff that is there
on your on your market in your country to
[SPEAKER_00]: check for it because Israel is a different
environment It makes me think of in the US
[SPEAKER_01]: every state that has a legal like a
recreational or a medical market for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has different standards for
testing some of them will test for
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides some of them won't some of them
will test for mycotoxins like from a mold
[SPEAKER_01]: or some Something like that that could
have been produced on the flower some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them don't Yeah, some of them test for THC
percentage using one protocol some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: use another protocol all these different
things where it's not standardized at all
[SPEAKER_01]: but some people are still wanting to use
the standardizations we have in place and
[SPEAKER_01]: then open up interstate commerce or
international commerce and How can you do
[SPEAKER_01]: that when the product from you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Market is just gonna go to this other
market if it gets tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna fail and it's gonna get either
trashed or Returned but it was still all
[SPEAKER_01]: that shipping cost is gonna then fall on
the initial It's gonna get destroyed onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market, you know destroyed
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna get destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely destroyed so it's it's
not something where I feel like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: mature enough within the market to be able
to even start to think about that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: until we start creating a little bit more
standardization and Less of this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: fog that is the cannabis market where you
can't necessarily know how it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: even Be tested within your own state's
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different standards of testing
for each facility within a Specific state
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can't even know like one one
Company might test your your product and
[SPEAKER_01]: come out at 20% THC Another company might
test your product and it'll come out at 35
[SPEAKER_01]: THC And the only difference is is that
they pulled it from the top of the bag
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the bottom of the bag Yes,
you know, it's it's stuff like that where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like how can we use those that level
of discrepancy within our standards and
[SPEAKER_01]: Say well, we can apply this to a larger
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just doesn't make a lot of sense to
me And you're making a very valid point
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know within a market like you're
operating in where you have to have all
[SPEAKER_01]: these standards Something as simple as
using one pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally fine within your market It
causes the entire shipment to get
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed all that money gone all that
production Yes, all that time and effort
[SPEAKER_01]: gone, right all because you didn't read
somebody else's standards You know what is
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed in your country what is allowed in
those this country where you try to export
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have two papers and then you
have to make you measure you like what You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and then you find this cross like oh
fuck we using this and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing it Oh fuck, you know,
yeah, this is the shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah That's a lot to deal with the thing
is that I always you know, I am a lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: one that I Really don't use a lot of
pesticide in my facility I try my thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of course I use some but it's
really soft one plant wash also But the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important thing most most important
thing clean your fucking floors Yeah walk
[SPEAKER_00]: in with the shoes that you are walking
into your facility have a changing You
[SPEAKER_00]: change your clothes change your shoes
Always like to use a bath or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: a shoe baths We have we have a mat which
is like you step on it and it's like this
[SPEAKER_00]: infecting stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but most most of it this will not
prevent No anything if you don't use extra
[SPEAKER_00]: your shoes in the company is your shoes
You don't you don't walk with those shoes
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else and when the floors of the
facility has to be so clean That I can I
[SPEAKER_00]: can lick it away, you know, absolutely
that is the thing that is most I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can make maintain The most pest
free environment through this first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because when the clean clean floor
is there then there is no more There is no
[SPEAKER_00]: more room for these things to to be really
impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not they don't have hiding places
So, um We already talked a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about your mother practices and your
Cloning practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the other parts of
your facility that are either unique to
[SPEAKER_01]: your setup or that you Really feel as
though you have dialed in Because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in a mixed light setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a it's a greenhouse with
supplemental lighting Actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a greenhouse but it's like it's
like You know, it's made from panels,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like industrial complex But
one side of this industrial complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glass wall Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so just the wall is glass not the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not the ceiling The ceiling is not
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceiling is sunlight, you know,
it's the light is Austrian producer that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have for lead lights and this this
producer Developed these slides that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have this line the evil line for six years
developed On cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lead lights are specifically made
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the company again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard of them not with you and
son but as a and sunlight It's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start to sell in European in the
American market.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they just know that they're really
they're really really good They are really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive also, but also very quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is the top top shelf lamp Are
they or are they high bay lights where you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you're keeping them still six seven
eight feet above the plants or are they
[SPEAKER_01]: The bar style arrays where you're dropping
them right down, you know 18 to 20 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: above the can do both with those Okay,
actually when you do the vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation like I do I always keep them
very high Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't go but when you do
flowering with these lamps because they
[SPEAKER_00]: are full spectrum lamps You go close You
can go close and this whole facilities in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland and all I mean this facility
really big facilities they are providing
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities with these lights for years now
and they are really like You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see no actually they will come to
your market now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So And they are actually like Steve Jobs
one guy made it, you know Martin is his
[SPEAKER_00]: name Yeah is a guy that made you know,
he was a grower and that guy Produced his
[SPEAKER_00]: own lead lead labs, but because he was not
satisfied with the lead labs What that was
[SPEAKER_00]: that was on the market at the time and he
was in a garage And from that garage a
[SPEAKER_00]: million million company Came to light no,
you know, and they are really good
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and we have a good relation I
was supporting them in a time when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were not so known actually and I bought
all the B stock From those lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had you know, I bought these
lamps Which is perfect, you know the same
[SPEAKER_00]: lamps that they sell now at Evo line but
thing is that the glass because the
[SPEAKER_00]: protection is E 65 that means you can
spray in this environment with these lamps
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can they are waterproof lead
lamps and you can spray sulfur sulfur also
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like coating for because lead
lamps you can destroy it with sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Maybe people don't know that and they
spray and then they are wondering why the
[SPEAKER_00]: lamps are going off at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because Sulfur will eat your Diodas,
you know, it's like it's like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so actually with these lamps I
produced most quality moms Because HPS was
[SPEAKER_00]: good also before that but in a certain
time, you know in winter time when you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need so much eating then but Now
it's like the electricity went so high and
[SPEAKER_00]: you need sufficient light You need a
setting when the the light the density of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light is so that You can see it on the
internodal spacing of the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it on the on the stem How you
can see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is they need more feet Then
you need to feed them more calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium iron sulfur zinc Mangan boron
molybdenum, you know trace elements and
[SPEAKER_00]: audio stuff because they will eat up more
because to use all of these photons that
[SPEAKER_00]: come down right now lead light Some people
will tell that is not so good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it Why because they were used
to grow 30 years under HPS and metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halide and the product was Really good and
now lead lights the product is not there
[SPEAKER_01]: for them because they Went from one
facility where they had HPS and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, I have all this Air
conditioning right and I don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of dehumidification I won't need that and
then they go to LEDs and it's the inverse
[SPEAKER_01]: right you have less heat production So you
don't need as much HVAC in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: the cooling but you need a lot more
dehumidification because your
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration Under LEDs is just way
higher because your photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: potential from that LED is it's just more
ideal light then HPS for for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, so you just I I've seen other
people run into that problem where they go
[SPEAKER_01]: from one to the other and they say oh LEDs
don't work that well and it's like just
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your temperatures a little higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your humidity a little higher,
but make sure that it's not getting out of
[SPEAKER_01]: whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yes There is always a balance of
things, you know the Meta stars of your
[SPEAKER_00]: body, you know is the same with those
things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like the metabolic rate Yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the metabolic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, absolutely Yeah,
it just goes up when you have more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: input So for example, you know when I
caught a mom that is that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: Reveging for the last three weeks what I
was not cutting her for three weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: she's like putting out these really
branches You know like wah and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: caught her the next time I'm not gonna
feed her a lot You know, I caught her I
[SPEAKER_00]: when she's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give her a normal pedigree and then the
next time when I Water her Then she gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of food, but I need to cut out the
babe the basic of her from from beneath To
[SPEAKER_00]: up just to leave the few Nodias that I
want to shoot right that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how I create good stems with
clones that you don't have a lot of When
[SPEAKER_00]: you have too much density the all these
small branches underneath They don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything away the energy for the clones
that you want to cut from your moms Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what are you typically feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what strength of electrical
conductivity for your normal moms?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you feeding your clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you cut it back a little bit
after you cut moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of those different
parameters you run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the water From the tab is zero point
four zero point five right with my place
[SPEAKER_00]: normally have a regime of for the the
Clones in the in the chamber for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feed them at all from the time
They are caught that don't feed them And
[SPEAKER_00]: from the 10th day on they gave I give them
zero point three AC so Zero point zero
[SPEAKER_00]: point seven zero point eight when you when
you measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I use a very specific You know a
bill Nova company bill Nova Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've heard it is a green green one
and they have hydro super mix It's a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a specific product which is working
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made for one part vegetative It is
one part vegetative application and you
[SPEAKER_00]: you use it like it's empty And you use it
as that and you just you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like made for made for hydroponic
systems It's a mineral stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you it's do you find that you have to
add any additional calcium or?
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add also from Kana, you know the
isotonic There is a tonic is always it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: route route babe route booster or What's
in the right booster again a rhizotonic
[SPEAKER_00]: it's called And it's you know,
the tree that is made that is growing next
[SPEAKER_00]: to rivers It's very if you cut a branch
from that tree and you stick it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will root Willow tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay willotree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes And the willow tree is the base of
that product That is what guy the guy told
[SPEAKER_00]: me from comma, you know that he said
actually the concept of the rhizotonic of
[SPEAKER_00]: the of the product of a root enhancer
Sure, it is actually from willow trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got that's like it stinks like
like it stinks like you know It does not
[SPEAKER_00]: smell very good when you open the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but Willow was where people found
What was it aspirin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe initially was like willow shoots
you could you found like the the same
[SPEAKER_01]: component for aspirin and then I think it
also even has a significant amount of IBA
[SPEAKER_01]: the indole 3 butyric acid and so people
could use that for Giving to their their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to help promote health and one
thing that I found out recently that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know a lot of people don't know but you
can use aspirin if like if your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: have Like a viroid like hops late in fire
or something like that If you add aspirin
[SPEAKER_01]: like just your regular aspirin to your
nutrient solution, and I don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact amount so Look it up people but
It'll Promote a healthy plant and reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those viral symptoms which is Like
if you need to limp along to a harvest or
[SPEAKER_01]: if you need to keep something alive Just
long enough to make sure you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy cuttings off of it and then either
put it through tissue culture or something
[SPEAKER_01]: if it is a viral pressure you can use
Things like aspirin to do that and with a
[SPEAKER_01]: willow extract you're getting both,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting yeah the promotion of this
oxen for heavy root development as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: this potential Pathogen suppression
overall health tonic I guess you could say
[SPEAKER_01]: so that that's really fascinating I I
could see how that especially for moms if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeding that you know, you're maybe
raising the overall Oxen count in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant so that you're rooting your cuttings
root fast, you know and yeah vigorously
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be hungry Yeah, you know not
hungry that they start to yellow on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf because they start to to get the
nitrogen from the leaf stable socket
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes when you root it on the
rock wall, it happens much earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is no you know, there is an
it's neutral medium It has no food inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this speed based stuff the easy
plugs They have a little bit of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and so but this stuff doesn't so if
you don't use the hydro super Mixed stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some some kind of MPK You get
faster yellowing, but the root is still
[SPEAKER_00]: there Sure as as soon as you put it into a
medium, which has some nutrients it will
[SPEAKER_00]: work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But the thing with the mom that you
asked me before where do I go with the EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have in regimen a regime that would be
between 1.0 to 1.3 EC for the Vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: months, you know sometimes now where I go
until 2.2 or 2.5 But I do it once every 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days only Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wait, you have to know what I put
inside to get this 2.5 Not night not
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and not phosphorus It is all Iron
Calcium Magnesium And all the trace
[SPEAKER_00]: elements, which is zinc boron mangan
molybdenum It is you know it all the trace
[SPEAKER_00]: elements with the Micro elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah macro elements is NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the macro elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micro elements is calcium magnesium
iron Yeah, and then you have this zinc and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the trace but the trace this Is so
important for the mom health That normally
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to give her a decent amount of
those stuff every 14 days when she's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting older Because if you don't do
that, she cannot eat anything else She
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot if she doesn't have this she cannot
eat the phosphorus and nitrogen and Calium
[SPEAKER_00]: and nothing She she will look you will
lock it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will add the nitrogen, but she will
not eat it So you found that with your
[SPEAKER_01]: mom's the the limiting factors are Usually
the micro elements rather than the macro
[SPEAKER_01]: elements you feel as though you can yes
You can provide a steady amount of macro
[SPEAKER_01]: elements to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by increasing the micro elements you
Sustain healthy growth over a longer
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you keep keep up the you keep you
unlock Because if you don't have the micro
[SPEAKER_00]: elements the macro elements are Not
available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just limiting the whole like
Robisco cycle and yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's that's super
fascinating because I we we've just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of slowly increased the EC of our mother
feed over time because we've just found
[SPEAKER_01]: that in because we were under LEDs for all
of our plants indoors and Once we reach
[SPEAKER_01]: the certain level the limiting factor
seemed to always be the neutral Because we
[SPEAKER_01]: had like high PPFD really nice vapor
pressure deficit Airflow was great high
[SPEAKER_01]: co2 levels when needed And so we just were
like well if they just need more food and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've now gone all the way up to I think
it's like 3.8 to 4.0 EC on our on our
[SPEAKER_01]: mother feed and they're just wait healthy
as can be Yeah, no, no just on the mothers
[SPEAKER_01]: for in veg Because they we just get these
super thick pithy stems now where there's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's no hollow stems and I
know that's a whole debate within the the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis scene as well as hollow stems
versus problem to Hallow stems are a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in general because it just means
that you're missing something in the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall plant food There's there's no
benefit to the plant to having a hollow
[SPEAKER_01]: stem people like oh, it's a it's a
nutrient straw That's not where the water
[SPEAKER_00]: goes We call it the hemp trade hemp plants
make that right because that which is
[SPEAKER_00]: which is cannabis But but hemp we don't
like to have it hemp way, you know No,
[SPEAKER_01]: well cuz like the phloem and xylem,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are gonna be contained within the
outer part of the stock of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the inner pith is just kind of
like the bones if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just building structures so that the
plant can hold itself up so if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy plants in flower or in veg you
want a lot of of Pith in it, but if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: you know growing for fiber alone,
then yeah You don't want pith you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to put all that energy into fast vertical
upward growth all in the xylem and phloem
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've heard that before that it is
a hemp trait and that it you know if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for drug Cannabis then hemp traits
aren't necessarily what you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting and one secret Wolf one secret
is if you pick males and Gabby would
[SPEAKER_00]: disagree now, but it's my version If you
pick males never pick the first flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: ones because they carry a hemp trait
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, don't it will not people say like
yeah The faster flowering males will be
[SPEAKER_00]: the faster flowering females.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it has nothing to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all Not it will not relate you can
have a late flowering male Which will be
[SPEAKER_00]: much more drug trait but that's
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard that as a drug versus
hemp trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it as a Potential for intersex
trait where if you choose males that
[SPEAKER_01]: flower too early It means that it is
really want to show that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but but Nick Intersex traits are
actually hemp traits also because sure
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex traits are wanted In the hemp
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to produce a homogeneous
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's intersex traits,
that means that it's No longer what
[SPEAKER_01]: diocese, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's almost more monacious at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be very stable production
You know, you have it all in one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the male and female parts of one
plant You have it see that already you can
[SPEAKER_00]: drive through the machine through it and
you harvest it and you have seeds That's
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so but we don't we are not industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So So this thing is let's let's I can just
tell people that if they looking for males
[SPEAKER_00]: from one line Try to find the middle to
late ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones those other sure Yeah,
that's very fascinating because I whenever
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked for males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have always Looked for the first flowers
because I like to have the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: initiation happen early, especially if I'm
gonna grow outdoors in northern latitude I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure that I have a fast
initiation of flowers so that I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: faster finish potentially as long as I'm
still shooting for those Those traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica or like Himalayan Afghanistan
varietals that are gonna have a shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time So that's really
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really interesting how
Everyone has their unique approach to what
[SPEAKER_00]: males they look for I will not tell that
I'm right, you know, this is not this is
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is my theory only I I'm in love
with cannabis like you are also so
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's like people have too much
of You know seriousness in inside of like
[SPEAKER_00]: no, you're not right and you know,
he hates you know, I Don't hate nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's it's up to the person how
you approach a thing and what is your own
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with it, you know Why I would
lie now here to you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about You know how much
anybody hates me now because I said
[SPEAKER_00]: something that he's not agreeing with but
I like to Have kind of people also to be
[SPEAKER_00]: invited into the show to have a different
opinion than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would be great You know,
I like if we all have the same opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be an echo chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that The yes, man,
you know always say you say something I
[SPEAKER_00]: say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes There would be no conversation and
honestly like I don't even Look at
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering times as my first indicator of a
male when I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at structure You know,
I want I want healthy side branches big
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorous, you know giant leaves Healthy
green growth all on my uniform Feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule, you know, I'm not gonna change
something for one male or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be like which one does the best
at this standard It's it's really you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, sometimes is this team rub,
you know, I choose because Between yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to choose sometimes between two,
you know, I painted down already to two
[SPEAKER_00]: males and then I had to choose one of
those males how how the last thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: did because sniff it or everything what
you said now is was there with those two
[SPEAKER_00]: bears but then how how it's like rub it
rub it rub it smell it smell it smell it
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this one or this one this one or
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna be this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it, you know And then it's
funny because the next year you might have
[SPEAKER_01]: had a different A different choice because
your palates maybe they would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know This maybe we're not
smelling that right that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's like but something do you
think that people that are High-class
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders today that all of these people
are able to just find males like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know No, it's like I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like it It is like, you know,
nobody can really tell I would just say
[SPEAKER_00]: like Nobody can really tell and people
should try try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not, you know That I said the earlier
one that they don't should be used use it
[SPEAKER_00]: now So you will see and you can go and
fuck me up You know like Sasha you were so
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong when you told this look I got this
elite clone now from that male that was
[SPEAKER_00]: too early Look how nice this plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's funny I mean it is something
people have to have their own experience
[SPEAKER_01]: to make their opinions On something like
that and you know, you have your
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you have your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my experience That's why I have my
opinion But it's not like either one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them is correct or wrong or you know,
it's it's just our own opinions,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, so, you know since you you
know, you've grown for I don't know more
[SPEAKER_01]: than 20 years, right you've done outdoor
crops indoor crops pivoted into a Clone
[SPEAKER_01]: company from where you were made Making
you know your own flower for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption So you've seen a lot of the
different aspects of the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially working with these European
European standard committees that require
[SPEAKER_01]: you to have You know one set of standards
for one country that you're shipping to
[SPEAKER_01]: another set of standards for another
country that you're shipping to So you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to tie all those together and make
your own set of standards to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're compliant You know you you
have a lot of experience witnessing these
[SPEAKER_01]: different sides of the industry and we
didn't even get into it on this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: but from previous episodes that we've had
you on, you know, we know that you travel
[SPEAKER_01]: to events like spandibus or the the German
cannabis exposition all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different things that you've
seen that you've had experience with makes
[SPEAKER_01]: you I Feel like I always say this but it
makes you a great person to ask this
[SPEAKER_01]: question Where do you want to see the
cannabis industry go over the next five to
[SPEAKER_01]: ten years?
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's make it more specific About your
area not necessarily on a global stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like within your market What would you
like to see change or where would you like
[SPEAKER_01]: to see it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would definitely like to see it being
decriminalized, you know I you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria where I have this business is
still illegal In my country where I live
[SPEAKER_00]: is absolutely illegal everything even
clones are not allowed to do you can only
[SPEAKER_00]: grow hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But the thing is the industry as
itself, you know my problem with it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that The big players will take over,
you know, like there will be no this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: I my wish would be to have a craft flower
Dispensary, you know one day, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: behind What I do as a business of my
library that all of this library would be
[SPEAKER_00]: available to people that come to my place
Like all of these clones are also in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower form here with good wine and good
beer and good something to eat You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: right like a touristic stuff, you know,
like spotting, you know, like enjoy your
[SPEAKER_00]: life think yeah, but industry as itself I
would like to see it to be decriminalized
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense so To be to be able to grow
your own wheat at home for your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: use and then the industry that would allow
people from all kind of You know areas to
[SPEAKER_00]: join it, which will not be possible
Actually, I know this is all like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: all like fairy tales what I tell now,
but Corporations are taking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Here like even more than US
market it here is even more specific They
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even want the people to to to get
access They want straight to the hardcore
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceutical wheat and it's there is no
social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no Home growing there is no you
can just buy it, you know for big money
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but actually it's so problem that
people grow it already so much and it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: embedded into the culture already That is
actually then it's even more You know the
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen will even more protest and even
more he will be self-sufficient You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he will even more try to get his own good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because Home growers will always
produce better wheat than the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that that is with tomatoes the
same thing sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah tomatoes from your own garden will
always taste better than the one from from
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same on all Actually,
it is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah The industry will the industry
Besides us, you know, it will if it start
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize here then after few years like
Kevin Jodry already told and I agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: him the US market will Come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely It will be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stand no chance here against your
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have we have no chance But we can have
little islands Of craft Right auctions
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be maintained I can tell you
this until I leave I will maintain this
[SPEAKER_00]: but This will be something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's not for the masses Like
good music was not for the masses in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, but then the people
realize the truth and then again we come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to You know, it's history repeats
itself again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's just too much stigma
still and we need to be able to break that
[SPEAKER_01]: down a little bit podcasts like this help
because we provide a more More insight to
[SPEAKER_01]: just each of our lives how we go about You
know promoting this plant caring for this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant Producing this plant and you know,
I feel like a day brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and there is so many people that
still look at it as this criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, but Normalizing the conversation
like this is very important because we
[SPEAKER_01]: allow for people to see that These are
just two people out there growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know clones for you Flower for me all
the like we're just doing it right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that big of a deal It's just like
any other any other crop and we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that our what we're making is
Not I don't know if we want to say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the best but it's the best version that we
want to put out there, right and So I do
[SPEAKER_01]: feel as though, you know a little bit more
or a little yeah more decriminalization
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily legalization with
standards and Let's be realistic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know because it's a plant Yeah,
I always lived like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now man after so many years of
Listening to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a First of all, let's
decriminalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put a foot in the door first,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it shouldn't be a question of
legality and illegality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant We should just be able to
grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if that's if if the need is to
make some sort of dichotomous key of
[SPEAKER_01]: Legality versus illegality then we're
already kind of fighting a losing battle
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's how I I feel about it Me
too, but it's like I've been born into
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal market already and it was always
illegal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in it for my grandfather's maybe it was
not But that was in the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: century, you know, right for it was
Illegal, you know night it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that that footage of Henry Ford
banging a hammer on a Ford car Have you
[SPEAKER_00]: seen yeah made of hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that was before it was illegal,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right after that because he wanted
to make cars be built from hemp material
[SPEAKER_00]: fueled by hemp fuel, you know,
he was crazy guy and Actually the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: system, you know DuPont came, you know,
which made plant nylon right nylon patent
[SPEAKER_00]: and DuPont sent Henry J Anslinger to be
the head of The DAA right what we know
[SPEAKER_00]: today as the D drug and drug enforcement
Agency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And had Henry J Anslinger is the guy and
his people that actually turned cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: into this kind of stuff that we know
today, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely, but behind him is DuPont and
DuPont is the Corporation that owns the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent on nylon Which is plastic Right and
they didn't want to have hemp plastics At
[SPEAKER_00]: that moment we lost the war we lost the
war because nylon was created and
[SPEAKER_00]: Destroyed our planet our oceans are
polluted with it Instead of hemp plastics,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be the second option We fucked
we fucked up It is interesting to look
[SPEAKER_01]: back at history and see These inflection,
you know, it's where something changed and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like it could have been different
You know, Jack Herrer was the guy that
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with the video you saw that hemp
for victory Yeah, it is a video that he
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get from some some archives and
he released it as you know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans see that in 99 1943 the
government of USA Legalized hemp again,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they really are legalized wheat Just
to make materials for for the army,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know again for the wars, you know,
I didn't know that Yeah, hemp for victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to look back into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man haven't for victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it's a day It was illegal
wheat was illegal for 1925 or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1926 and then it was legal between 1943
and 1945 Yeah for production sure of Fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Navy and for you know,
and it was that and and Jack found that
[SPEAKER_00]: video first They don't want to give him,
you know, that would be a story man Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody in the community knows about this
story But I know as a Slovenian guy that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that this video this footage was
found by Jack and he released it and first
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't want to give it to him Sure,
and then he released it that that he
[SPEAKER_00]: actually show how corrupt the government
actually how Hippocratic it is to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: allow something in a certain time and then
forbid it again Like they they they make
[SPEAKER_00]: it illegal then make it legal again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it illegal again and now make it
legal again That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's It's a giant hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's very frustrating at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know with when you smoke your first
joint, you know Exactly, I've seen those
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences happen real time Well with
again with all of your experience One of
[SPEAKER_01]: the questions I do like to ask is What
would be some advice that you would give
[SPEAKER_01]: to new growers if there is something like
one little piece of advice that you think
[SPEAKER_01]: is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Up there amongst the highest of value
advice that could be given to a new grower
[SPEAKER_00]: To a new grower now in this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would That my advice would be Google
shit Google because at our time we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have Google we don't have the internet We
don't have no source of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to make all the mistakes You don't
need to make all the mistakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But be be patient and try to to be focused
on information not not Try, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the way that everything should be
thrown at you and then you have to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: information like What you know,
of course plant seeds Yeah, and then of
[SPEAKER_00]: course try it here and also not only
cannabis try to grow your own food That
[SPEAKER_00]: would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's all the same thing Yeah,
just get into the garden start doing get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the garden stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you if you're living in big cities No
problem have a balcony if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: balcony have a you have a on the south
side of the if you have a south side
[SPEAKER_00]: Window you can plant anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's for the mind You know one
thing you have built for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I know that one thing people
don't think about especially when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just like those within the cannabis
community is you can take your Extra grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tent set up and grow some tomatoes or some
cucumbers or something else in there It's
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, and you'd be surprised at how well
it's gonna grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, you know, it's gonna Cannabis is
such a heavy feeder That when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you know a little a little
easier like a cucumber like a lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: cucumber or something that just grows very
Vigorously and prolifically you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to not know what to do with all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those cucumbers all those tomatoes
or peppers Yeah, you know definitely and
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be like a whole nother outlet for
the hobby if it is like a Home-growing
[SPEAKER_01]: hobby that you're developing and so yeah,
just start growing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard and it it's really
rewarding it is For the for the mental
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we need we need this as people It is
we are connected to this stuff so long
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wish everybody that You know,
you know, we don't live in very easy times
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a lot of things are going
on in the world and we will not get into
[SPEAKER_00]: it now me and Nick and It's like we all
should be aware that your Your neighbor is
[SPEAKER_00]: your brother Don't treat him as somebody
because maybe it will be a situation that
[SPEAKER_00]: you will need your neighbor Don't be don't
be like stop born and look just like that
[SPEAKER_00]: in your life money is not everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you should Actually human relations
are much more worth than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a I mean, that's a great sentiment
to sort of wrap up the podcast on I do
[SPEAKER_01]: have a couple of last-minute Questions
that I like to ask and I feel like you
[SPEAKER_01]: might have heard them before from me So
we'll just get right into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is your favorite strain of all
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Fuck As a librarian you have too many
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a big problem One of those
would be the headband and one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the the super silver case Man
that are so very different strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny that you said that because
headband is my partner's favorite strain
[SPEAKER_01]: and Super silver haze is the first strain
we ever smoked together So the odds that
[SPEAKER_01]: those are your two favorite strains is
really funny Yeah, but they are combining
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing about cannabis what I really
love the energetic Racy sativas and the
[SPEAKER_00]: headstone coach lock body like golf balls
smell You know, I'm not really really into
[SPEAKER_00]: skunks, you know, I was and skunks are
okay, but It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I always liked you know,
do you like You know how the market has
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of changed into this whole like
purple candy Gas thing where that's all
[SPEAKER_01]: the people want I am one of I feel like
I'm one of the few people that has no
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with that because You know if it's
sweet and gassy all at the same time that
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds delicious and oh, yeah the fact
that we're going for all this photogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: quality to the the buds that we're growing
just makes it that much more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's always a visual aspect of
Picking up the flower breaking it apart
[SPEAKER_01]: grinding it up rolling a joint looking at
it, you know, that's It's a whole part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the the experience one of my favorite
smokes in the last Times now is American
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that I got from finest it is called
cross data and it's Sunset sherbet
[SPEAKER_00]: sherbert biscotti Sunday cross It sounds
and it's like it's it's candy gassy Which
[SPEAKER_00]: is normally it's gassy but can it's very
fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure very very like fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable Smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do find it really funny when
people are like, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want something You know, I want some old
good green weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like feel free, you know, I don't I
don't mind that at all, but The stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: really tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is it is but sometimes when you then
get this super silver haze again Which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really like green, you know like light
green And then you smoke that like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like the incense somebody comes into the
room it will He will be like instantly you
[SPEAKER_00]: were smoking the amnesia Yeah,
it's everybody here in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you it's amnesia Amnesia is
super silver haze that men don't not many
[SPEAKER_00]: people know that but Amnesia is just a
coffee shop name for the weed for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: there were there was no amnesia I mean
soma will be angry now if if I tell it
[SPEAKER_00]: like this soma released amnesia haze But
amnesia haze is just a super silver haze
[SPEAKER_00]: version I mean the super silver haze
crossed to some hazes But it's this the
[SPEAKER_00]: super silver was always shorter on the
flowering time for hazes because cases go
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 13 weeks and The super silver
hazes that we grew here are like 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weekers 10 11 weeks, maybe maybe Nobody
goes to 12 weeks Yeah, yeah Here some some
[SPEAKER_00]: some people do but in general people who
grow for market then they used to if they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow haze They go for the for the amnesia
for the super silver because it has this
[SPEAKER_00]: some even Get it in nine weeks You can put
it on the market in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually some people will think
that is right Because it has the effect it
[SPEAKER_00]: has the quality but if you go over 10 or
11 week you have top shelf, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the that's it And that is,
you know still long, you know in 10 or 11
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks for for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a problem Yeah, yes, absolutely and
you can't because it like for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part you can if you produce really really
nice sativa versus really really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: indica and just using those terms as a
representation of the flowering time Also
[SPEAKER_01]: like an eight week versus a 12 week,
right you can't then charge one and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: times For the 12 week, right if you're
getting a thousand dollars per kilo,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say right You can't then of you know
a runs or a candy or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You then can't say well, I have this super
silver haze that I grew for 12 weeks I
[SPEAKER_01]: want fifteen hundred dollars per kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no one's gonna say oh it's worth that
much more because you Grew it that much
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say this is still a pound of weed
I can only sell it for yes so much per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only you know in this area here
where we live in the Balkans and Austria
[SPEAKER_00]: and here these areas the amnesia cut of
They call it the core cut core cut because
[SPEAKER_00]: a guy from England named core His his
synonym on the forum is core.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm, and he put out some cuts That's
why he's the core cut because one guy
[SPEAKER_00]: named core put out the cut So is the
amnesia core cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is high proceeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Holland based company But actually
the genetics as itself as a bay parental
[SPEAKER_00]: genome is the super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah But they they they popped a lot
of seeds to get these nine to ten weaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, which is so popular since 15 20
years it's around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and yeah, it's still it's still
people still grow that and It's still
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still sold in many shops But you have
to understand that this is a very rare
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype of super silver haze is very
rare because Normally, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: productive and very fast finishing for us
for a super silver sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean normally the super silver Haze will
give you in 12 or 13 weeks a product like
[SPEAKER_01]: this one Well, you know, yeah,
it's yeah I mean that's also why you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: change your your price per pound on those
things because no one's gonna say Oh like
[SPEAKER_01]: how prove it that you grew it for 12
weeks, you know, like I found someone that
[SPEAKER_01]: grew this for nine weeks It's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the college strains came and they
actually they dropped the the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of amnesia here and there's the Shiva cut
either the The super silver haze cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: super it's very it's grown very very much
less than it was before Just because of
[SPEAKER_00]: college strengths sure because they took
over the market here in the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: years It is the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy Three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started the first college strains came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and now it's like It's going
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's everywhere and it's gonna go
back also I think so, which is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the market fluctuates It's you
know, that is the demand for what people
[SPEAKER_01]: want is all based on what I feel like is
commercialized You know, like what is
[SPEAKER_01]: popularized through Instagram or reddit or
all these other different forums or even,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in pop culture, right you can
have a a an artist of some band or or you
[SPEAKER_01]: know rap group or even rock and roll just
all these different Music genres where
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they'll mention some sort of
cannabis train in their music because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just what's popular to them at the time
and all of a sudden the demand for it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: up and Everyone's got to start producing
that because there's just you know
[SPEAKER_01]: increased demand within the market So it's
it is a fickle market and it just it is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to continue to fluctuate It is and I
think that headband and super silver haze
[SPEAKER_01]: are also some of those You know that they
have a good foundation where I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna go anywhere people are
always gonna want them because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: good experiences with them and So with
those being your favorite strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: who would you say is your favorite
breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shanti Bobo Yeah right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what makes him your favorite breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: his his down-to-earth mentality his When
you meet him you look him in the eye you
[SPEAKER_00]: ask a question He will tell you straight
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'd know we'd know I Mean I love
this kind of Persons, you know down to
[SPEAKER_00]: earth so much and the accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there will always be beefs again
You know people will some people will
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like him or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care I met that guy and I talked
to him and I really Loved the conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: really well, I mean there is other there
is others But for sure straight away to
[SPEAKER_00]: say how much he is influential to me and
how much he has done for the community And
[SPEAKER_00]: that's he still is producing keeping a low
profile and having Much more love for his
[SPEAKER_00]: family than his business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is very Impressive for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean sometimes, you know breeding
cannabis isn't it isn't rocket science,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can just have a little
pollen chucking event and create some
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds find something great and all of a
sudden You call yourself a breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So They they they asked this something,
you know, they asked him few years or ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago they asked him So what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this time it was already,
you know out of flowers immunized was
[SPEAKER_00]: taking over the market everywhere And what
are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your new strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when he was looking like that new
strains, you know, like I'm he did the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: crew at that time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some new strains, but it was really
scientific based Company which produced
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD based strains one-to-one ratios like
Three-to-one variation like really CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knows about breathing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this guy was asking about new
strains, he was like Same old story,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, same all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we do Nothing when I steal and we we
use males and females, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so all breathing techniques what we use
You know, that's that the base why right
[SPEAKER_00]: why you know, you know You have so much
tools now today labs that can pretend If
[SPEAKER_00]: it's male or if it's female sex testing
you have kind of innovators.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have everything more accessible today
So why not stay on the stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Systems that provide good stable genetics
sure and then just apply the analytics to
[SPEAKER_00]: it Just apply to analytics for breeding
purposes then to have like for female ice
[SPEAKER_00]: production Okay, it's okay, but don't you
know for for breeding for purposes of
[SPEAKER_00]: collection and preservation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminization is not the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you you can pin it down to one
phenotype Selfing you know, that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not preservation, you know preservation
would mean open pollination and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: genome Hidden in a group of family,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that is preservation and I think
the real breathing has to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation more Than it has to do with
pinning down to specific phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean they are two different Goals,
right one two different goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to preserve genetics then
open pollinating using large large
[SPEAKER_01]: populations of plants to provide large
Phenotypic variants so that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: bottlenecking your breeding projects
That's one style and then if you're you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Inline breeding reverse back-crossing
back-crossing trying to lock down certain
[SPEAKER_01]: traits for production qualities or for
desirable quality For an end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a totally different thing and both
are valid, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know because we like our drug cannabis
So it's gonna require some very intensive
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding practices to get to something
that people are really excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus you know if it's just something
where we're trying to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't lose the access to a genetic pool
for maybe future breeding practices or
[SPEAKER_01]: just for preservation sake just for the
sake of preserving what What's in that
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic pool then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah goals one other it's it's It really
depends on what you're trying to do and I
[SPEAKER_01]: agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you have somebody like Shanti
Baba who is He's kind of sticking to what
[SPEAKER_01]: he knows doing it as best as he can and
trying to perfect those practices versus
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating or chasing some hype,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Again, those are just two different
mentalities in two different mindsets So I
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really I see why you have a lot of
respect for him in terms of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain stuff Especially as yourself as a
librarian of cannabis Maintaining things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard work and And also not a lot of
people want it right now No, I still keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it as yeah, they will and always it's the
same thing people come back And they ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you then you know why you kept it for so
long again Because from time to time you
[SPEAKER_00]: have these deals for these cuts and then
still you are like, yes You know and these
[SPEAKER_00]: people Yeah, and also they they give you a
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks, man It's the real thing right
like for the plank cut for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like hey, man Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the plank cut back again from you
It is the same thing that we use To smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cut, you know, that's it Yeah,
that's what for me was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if I have one of that kind of
customers, I'm so it's worth it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely Well, I just have one
more question for you then What is the
[SPEAKER_01]: most memorable cannabis related experience
that you have whether it be smoking or
[SPEAKER_01]: growing or just anything cannabis related?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow For example, definitely will be more
than smoking growing It is even more a
[SPEAKER_00]: virus to me than using it as a drug
recreational drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually more The growing part was
always more Infectious for me than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a specific memory of cannabis
would be for example, you know Smoking it
[SPEAKER_00]: in Spain like, you know The best sativas
in Spain the bubble harsh the Moroccan
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh that there was imported the the you
know, the the Mongolian ditch weed the All
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of memories that you you you
were smoking cannabis all around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the best homegrown weed is was
always here for me I was I never met but I
[SPEAKER_00]: never saw better weed that I could produce
it myself for sure So it sounds just like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the growing aspect of it like
it's just a large memory all with a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of aspects tied together that you know,
there's just been something that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: such a part of your history that maybe
there's not just one that stands out but
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the overall aspect of there's been
so many good memories, but the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: always bring me back are the you know
homegrown Cannabis I have you know my late
[SPEAKER_00]: dad, you know He died like 13 years ago my
father and he was really one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie generations in Yugoslavia No,
they smoked hashish in the 70s you know
[SPEAKER_00]: are imported from from Turkey and He was
like also he told me about LSD and those
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you know, like he he his idols were
Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that stuff, you know I grow up with
that kind of music so and actually when he
[SPEAKER_00]: found the first Rizla That I was like 12
years old 13 years old and he found the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rizla in my room What's a Rizla?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rizla is the paper the smoking paper The
big one the big one, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a small one for tobacco He found the
big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he asked me what are you using
them for and and I said for tobacco I say
[SPEAKER_00]: are you smoking big cigarettes right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So next day man, he waited with a rolled
joint and he smoked with me the rolled
[SPEAKER_00]: joint I was 13 years old my father It's
like you will first smoke with me and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can smoke with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool And if you need weed you come
to me first and that that's what I did
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, you know It's like because he
knew what was good not yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome I had a similar
experience and I'll get into that enough
[SPEAKER_01]: in a future episode but I think you know
when you have your first experience or One
[SPEAKER_01]: of the really memorable experiences if
it's with like a parent or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's awesome He had you
know, that is not bad parenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually he was he was he cared so much,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He cared as a parent that I would not get
into bad circles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was there was a lot of heroin There
was a lot of cocaine was not at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a lot of drugs man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hardcore, you know,
so Better was that he you know to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what your kids are up to is better than
not knowing right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely when there's a lot of You know
set and setting in terms of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: experience Almost everything right,
you know, whether it be a drug or food or
[SPEAKER_01]: alcoholic beverage or even just you know a
concert right something just like an
[SPEAKER_01]: experience if you're in the right mindset
and the setting around you has Maybe an
[SPEAKER_01]: energy that you're looking for or you
know, if if it's like an upbeat positive
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing then you're gonna experience it one
way if it's you know, negative angry
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna experience it another way and
so to have someone who has as much care
[SPEAKER_01]: for you as you know a parent potentially
could then you might maybe the idea behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it is to provide that set and setting
where it's not gonna be a a problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: not an unenjoyable experience,
you know, the sentence would be do not
[SPEAKER_00]: deny your kids the education ever Fair
enough, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if it's like rolling the joint,
you know, like don't deny your kids the
[SPEAKER_00]: education, you know, yeah I love that a
little bit of joke aside, but it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of truth in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely be honest To your kids be
honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean if you lie to them they're
gonna yeah Telling them not to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something is the easiest way to get them
to do something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean by by showing them that
it's safe that there is or that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: safe ways to consume cannabis that there
is You know different products on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market some that are benefit, you know
that are good Some that are potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: bad harmful, you know, these are things
that yeah I I don't think that it
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily needs to come from a parent
but someone who's experienced older With
[SPEAKER_01]: care, you know and they're and they're
doing it for a place of care and concern
[SPEAKER_01]: versus Punishment and authority,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a really important
thing Well Sasha, this has been a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful conversation and I really
appreciate you For the listeners that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know he just kind of hopped on to
this podcast today because we had to pivot
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit from another person that was
going to be joining us but We have been
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting to get Sasha's story about growing
and a little bit more of his Gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques and thoughts behind that on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much I really appreciate you
coming on today and doing this with me
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's nice to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely it is, you know getting this
information out there Like I always like
[SPEAKER_01]: to say it helps grow the community and
that's the way we grow That's the way you
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll talk soon Bye Bye You You
