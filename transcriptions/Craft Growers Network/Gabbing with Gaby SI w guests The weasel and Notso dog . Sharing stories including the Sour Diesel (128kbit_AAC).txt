[SPEAKER_03]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_03]: Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeds, and they are the only place
that you can get the Gabby Staten Island
[SPEAKER_03]: collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Gabby Staten Island doing the
Gabbing with Gabby podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: With my co-hosts, Nick Wolf and Cosmic
Charlie.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also joined today by Natsodog who's
helping us out with this interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Natsodog, just watch your
positioning on the screen because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: cutting off your face a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to put the camera back a
little bit and center yourself a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got my good friend,
Mike, who's also known as the Weasel or
[SPEAKER_03]: Klop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to ask him why and how he got
that nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the main focuses of this
podcast for me is to tell my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mike is a big part of the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, he's the guy that created the
Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get started one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Natsodog, you're cutting off your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's hard to see sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're not centered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hunched.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like a hunchback over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just center yourself a little bit that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have plenty of headroom, but you just
need to move over that way a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's better.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me start by saying the Weasel,
Mike, he's a longtime friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm super excited to have him on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lots of people have been asking for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike, I want to start by us telling the
story about how we met.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've discussed it a little bit in
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you want to just start off and tell a
story about how we met?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, I believe, fall of 92,
right after the dead shows at Madison
[SPEAKER_07]: Square Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 91.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, 91.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just already in California in 92.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, but you were going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's wait a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was sitting on my back steps.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll put it this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was spun from the show last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And some hippies walking by and he shoots
me a peace sign.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit him back with one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he turns around, comes walking over
and asked me if I needed any buds,
[SPEAKER_07]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll smoke some weed with this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because hey, I have two friends that are
around the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, he's all right if they come over?
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, can I go meet him?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the town Eltonville on Richmond
Avenue in the train station.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got long black hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got one single dreadlock,
a lot of purple on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's with a girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're sitting by the edge of the
street, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they introduced me to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next thing we know, we're going to meet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're up at my house.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys are camping out for a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we hooked up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we started talking about weed and
growing and ideas.
[SPEAKER_07]: The wheels were rolling right then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way I remember it is that we showed
you some indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had never seen indoor weed before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had grown outdoors for over a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over a decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was the first time you ever saw
some indoor kind bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember you saying, you can grow
this inside?
[SPEAKER_03]: You were just shocked and amazed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was shocked and amazed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wasn't really growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd grow one or two plants outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for saying to grow them for 10 years,
it's kind of, and you're only doing it a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The wheels were rolling right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, the wheels were rolling
upstairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went and I got a book.
[SPEAKER_07]: All my friends laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started growing in the closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, before the closet,
it was the fish tank.
Remember?
[SPEAKER_07]: That I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me remind you, because that's what's
great about having multiple people here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I remember is, you planted your
first seeds in a fish tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you just put some soil on the bottom
of the fish tank and you put some seeds in
[SPEAKER_03]: there and your cat kept digging it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he thought it was a litter box.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I was telling Natsodog and
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I love having these conversations
with people because we all remember
[SPEAKER_03]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I will never forget how mad you
were at that cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did it twice, not just once.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did it twice.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, I think seeds were hard
to come by, like good seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cat was disrupting them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think even when I put them in
the containers or whatever else I started
[SPEAKER_07]: to learn how to do, he was still digging
them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cat had to go eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in the cat's defense, there's
probably a significant overlap between
[SPEAKER_02]: like an indoor litter box and a nice
smoothed out bunch of soil on the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: of a fish tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smell and clean the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I tell people is that I inspired
you to plant those seeds and to grow your
[SPEAKER_03]: original plants in the closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after that, you were the one that
inspired me to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we inspired each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had seen indoor weed, but I had actually
at that point never seen it grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll never forget you had that closet
that you emptied out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like six feet by two feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you put like four foot
fluorescence in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had eight of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think it was that many.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had four on each end.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like eight feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight feet by two foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I used to have them on strings.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really primitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I think about it, it's kind of
embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's I don't think that's
embarrassing, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that it just goes to show
like how rudimentary knowledge was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was before the Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't just hop on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of times, like in my crew,
like learning how to grow weed was like
[SPEAKER_02]: secret knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you almost had to like become an
indentured servant to someone to teach you
[SPEAKER_02]: what was up, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first started growing,
I didn't know anything about electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had to like I plugged in a
thousand watt light and the circuit blew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to be like, well, why did that
happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's like now the stuff
that just seems on it like easy and basic
[SPEAKER_02]: and is easily available to discover.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all kinds of people to teach you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is prior to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you just you're just trying to
figure out how to maybe you could buy a
[SPEAKER_02]: book or two books.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't buy a book, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think it was around Halloween.
[SPEAKER_07]: All my Staten Island buddies, besides
Gabby, at the time, we went into the
[SPEAKER_07]: village for the parade and we were like,
yeah, I want to go over to Union Square
[SPEAKER_07]: first and get a book.
[SPEAKER_07]: I told him what it was about.
[SPEAKER_07]: They laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: How to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that Sam by any chance?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam, Kevin, Johnny Wheels, Jerry,
Johnny Wheels.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, all these guys laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon as that first crop came in,
they were all knocking on the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do we get this stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, at that point,
I was like, just like not so dog said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the one that you guys laugh at,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, it matters is who
laughs last.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all laughing still.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I wanted to what I wanted to say
is when I met Nick and Cosmic,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was in this group group on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Craft Craft Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the group is basically all about,
you know, showing photos of what they
[SPEAKER_03]: consider a craft flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes in the group, you know,
if it's a home grower and the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't look perfect, they'll say,
oh, you know, we can't include that
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's a much bigger garden,
you know, like hundreds of lights or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like, oh, that's too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made the argument that what makes
cannabis craft is how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's grown with love and the intention
to grow the highest quality product,
[SPEAKER_03]: then I consider that craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I use you and your first garden as an
example, because I remember that weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so first of all, if you remember weed
30 years later, that shit must have been
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can, if you held it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the one in the little closet.
[SPEAKER_07]: The closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the first stuff you grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under those fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you could hold those buds up to
the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see straight through them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you smoked it, that shit tasted
really good and got us super baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you grew that with love and the
intention of producing the best flower
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that's the greatest example
of craft cannabis, cannabis that's grown
[SPEAKER_03]: with love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the proof is that you inspire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, Sam, Johnny wheels and all those guys,
they wanted to grow too because of what
[SPEAKER_03]: you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you inspired a tremendous amount of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, not to kiss ass too
much, but thank you partner.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I remember out of that first
round the most that I learned about bugs
[SPEAKER_07]: instantly had a crash course because I
took soil from straight outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you couldn't like, you could go to
the store and buy it, but I didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: about Ross yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even know about him yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew about Kmart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sold soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could have gone there, but I didn't want
anybody to know that I'm buying soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you didn't even know that you,
that it wasn't a good idea to dig up the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil from outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we just, we just didn't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm battling spider mites from like days,
not like one month in I'm battling spider
[SPEAKER_07]: mites and I'm like, and I fought them off,
but it's all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got that round in, I think there was
maybe one round in that room.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was moved to the kitchen and
that's, that's where the RFK seeds went
[SPEAKER_07]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about the RFK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So June, Gabby and I in RFK with the
future Albany crew that's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're searching a lot for Bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my perspective of the show that
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hot, really hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody can find any Bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who comes back with Bud?
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabby's got a quarter ounce of looks like
greenhouse Bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like kind of moist, still kind of rolled
up, looked like a cigar almost,
[SPEAKER_07]: but in that shape, you know, but like,
just, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in that bag, there were, I think maybe
five seeds, something or right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there was seven seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got some, I got some, I don't
remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't get none.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't give me any of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we fought over them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I'm taking them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I remember I had these three distinct
different skunks that came out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one, two, and three.
[SPEAKER_07]: First one, we'll say the RFK one was very
much like a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: The number two was kind of sweet smelling
really nice Buds, but it had, it was
[SPEAKER_07]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the third one was fruity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: We lost that one right away, but the other
two survived for a few years.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were, they were nice plants that we
had.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting, you know, like indoor
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I can still taste that weed today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have a hard time remembering
like conversations and certain events,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I can, I remember what that shit
tasted like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I just wanted to
mention it quickly is you grew that shit
[SPEAKER_03]: for years, you know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So until I got seeds from Amsterdam and
once I came back, I ditched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe, maybe you go ahead,
dude, you speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how you kept plants around
for five years back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious what your process was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Learn the clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_07]: I learned to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was reading books.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking every bit of knowledge that I could
get out of a book.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, uh, I was hoping to get into,
uh, the horticulture system at Bronx
[SPEAKER_07]: community college.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got in, but I didn't stay in that
because it was really hard to commute like
[SPEAKER_07]: two hours from the other side of the city.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I cut that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so like, I just learned and read
everything I could on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, do you remember like what process
you used for cloning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when you were first doing it,
like, were you using any sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones for the roots or were you,
were you like, had you like discovered
[SPEAKER_01]: like Oasis, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ross was already in our life at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to bring that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get into Ross, but I'll
quickly answer the question is we use
[SPEAKER_03]: Oasis cubes and dipping grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing as now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some technology advances, some doesn't
too much, you know, you know, I was living
[SPEAKER_01]: around then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's just, I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, one thing, one thing that people
should know, I think is like these stories
[SPEAKER_02]: are, I mean, at least for me, and I,
I'm pretty sure it's the same for these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys too, is when we started smoking,
like the two kinds of easily available
[SPEAKER_02]: weed were brown Mexican and green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there could be various levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of compression or various levels of
quality or seed, but that was kind of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stumbling upon better weed or stumbling
upon bag seed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think back then the only two places
I knew how to get good weed were literally
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you wanted to go to Amsterdam and
most of my friends went to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_02]: first, because it was the literally the
only source of seed that anyone had any
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to get that wasn't Mexican,
because in the nineties right then it was
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of like, I don't know about New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Gabby had some like, you know,
Jamaican experience, but like in Chicago,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like, there wasn't any tie or
Colombian or Panamanian, like all that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff was from a different era.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Kind Bud was basically anything of
any quality that was better than the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was pretty much like it was
a, there was a huge range of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so yeah, you would go, like what he
just said, you would go before shows and
[SPEAKER_02]: you would scour the lot, the parking lot,
trying to find somebody selling better
[SPEAKER_02]: weed than you had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the core of the century right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind Bud was anything that wasn't Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 100% right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that wasn't Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, even like Gabby said,
it's homegrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind Bud could be like, grown in,
in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want $55 for this eighth and you hold it
up and you can see through it,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Gabby said, and you would still take
it because it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to pay to pay out the nose for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, and there's, this is,
this is obviously five or six years before
[SPEAKER_02]: the start of the internet or overgrow or
any of like the ways that people could get
[SPEAKER_02]: online and learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was maybe two or three or four
books.
[SPEAKER_02]: And high times that was pretty much the
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were blessed enough to have one
friend that was doing it, and you could
[SPEAKER_02]: like watch what they were doing and see,
and get some tips, however horrific those
[SPEAKER_02]: tips might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sort of like an entry way to get in
because the knowledge level was so
[SPEAKER_02]: rudimentary, you know, it really was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a while to find any swag anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had all those seeds from my
childhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to throw out the window because
we used to, I used to have to like my
[SPEAKER_02]: oldest daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to like go on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get muted Francis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hear anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everybody can hear me, but you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a check out the show later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like you guys hear everything,
but I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, we used to, I used to, I had to,
Google what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like brickweeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could show, like I have a adopted
daughter who's 26 and she grew up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she just never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to show her like, because when I
was trying to explain to her that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you got a sack, you had to break it
up and you had to take out all the STEM
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the seed and all the funky bits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could get a pile that you could
roll into a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was like looking at me all weird
because she grew up in the era of like
[SPEAKER_02]: seedless and like everybody knew what they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's the point I wanted to
make is that like in the very,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the very beginning, nobody knew what
they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the most rudimentary knowledge made
you seem like a wizard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just had to like, I mean,
I would get like Jorge Cervantes is like
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor marijuana gardening or Mel Frank's
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just read, um, this,
you know, like I learned everything I know
[SPEAKER_02]: about electric electricity, just from
trying to like figure out how can I plug
[SPEAKER_02]: in this dehumidifier and this light and
not have my circuit pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just went like, like stuff that seems
basic now, it was not basic then,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion, everybody had to like start
on this thing and then figure it out and
[SPEAKER_02]: then figure out a few more things and then
figure out a few more things, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, like he was just saying,
I'll shut up after this, but bag seed
[SPEAKER_02]: found in a sack of weed on the Grateful
Dead lot that came out of Kind Bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: super valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Mexican, better weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those seeds that, um, that we got from RFK
led to getting the chem dog from Greg
[SPEAKER_07]: eventually, really lucky to get at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't remember the story like
that, but that's again, okay, we should
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe just fast forward really fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Far since you're talking about this and
then go back because I know not so dog is
[SPEAKER_03]: only able to stay for a little while and
he's going to want to be part of this
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way I remember the story is I gave
him the, the skunk that I acquired by
[SPEAKER_03]: trading the Francine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never gave him the RFK.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, I never even had the
RFK.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I, I traded him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so that's how you got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I gave it to you, we went to this
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fish at the Roseland ballroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: After that, I went up to see him in the
Hamptons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I traded him for a cut with,
I went up there with Sam and I,
[SPEAKER_07]: we drove up, I gave him an RFK cut and the
skunk cut was another cut and I got the
[SPEAKER_07]: chem.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave him two cuts and I got the chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see, again, I'm glad we're talking
because the way I remember the story and
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly, you're probably right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always the first to admit that I'm
wrong is that I traded him and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought I gave you the chem dog,
but you probably had it already,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because I had, I was already in
California gave me the super scarf.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I think I gave you the, if that's the
case, that I gave you the skunk and the
[SPEAKER_03]: chem dog because here's a quick end of the
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a guy from Virginia that I met
at the Warfield and I smoked the Francine
[SPEAKER_03]: with him and he wanted the Francine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I drove the Francine across country and
I traded him for a few clones,
[SPEAKER_03]: including the VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the skunk from Virginia and that
was the plant that I ended up trading with
[SPEAKER_03]: chem dog for the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I traded him and you know, hope maybe we
can get him on the show too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his memory is probably as bad as
all of ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have a different story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I thought, you know, I gave you
the chem dog, but maybe I did or I didn't,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you could have traded him the RFK for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might've actually gotten it before me
because you lived out there and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened was you were responsible
for me making the deal with him for the
[SPEAKER_03]: chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like I was out East for that brief
period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to that fish show, but like you,
you became friends with him more than I
[SPEAKER_03]: did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think at the time it was like,
I didn't have a cut available.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had it, but it was flowering and I was
waiting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I was waiting for them to
root or you didn't want them that they
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't rooted or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I remember you asking me about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, I hope he's not mad at me
about the RFK.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I didn't have one rooted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could ask Greg if he's got one,
you know, because, or I don't remember
[SPEAKER_07]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's, I think that's the way it
went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I remember asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you did have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had it before I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked you for it and you weren't
able to give me a cut, but you encouraged
[SPEAKER_03]: me to make the trade with Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been taking the credit for giving
you the chem dog for years, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the funny part about weed history
like this really is that most of it starts
[SPEAKER_02]: with just small groups of friends doing
things that nobody has any idea will be
[SPEAKER_02]: important or anyone will care about later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a long time later, people start
asking for very specific details and
[SPEAKER_02]: people's memories are different,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to reminisce, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, you know, this is, this is like
way fast forwarding, but like when I met
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabby, he gave me the, he gave me a skunk
and, and the dog and the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought for years and years and
years, because that's how we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, that it was that it was the skunk from
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like a year or two ago,
I almost said his name, but skunk VA was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, no, I think that was a different
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he would have given him because I
think we lost it right before Gabby met
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can hear stuff and you can have
like, you can have stuff that just seems
[SPEAKER_02]: normal because your buddy told it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a skunk from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which got lost before I met you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had gotten seeds from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those who have a super scope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to throw something else out
there for a clock too, is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's this, we can, we'll fast
forward or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone wants to talk about the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the sour, I mean, essentially the sour
story, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that there was these, there was these
gentlemen that were, that were getting
[SPEAKER_02]: sacks off of Weasel, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the course of probably like an entire
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would, they would, anytime they
found seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They would hold, they would hoard the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed pretty clear for a long time
that Weasel, you were growing the chem dog
[SPEAKER_02]: and the VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it comes up that
like, you're like, no, I was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: growing the RFK one and the RFK two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might've had this other super skunk
and I had the VA skunk and I had the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, do you, I mean, do you even
remember what were you growing in 1994?
[SPEAKER_07]: I had probably 10 different strains going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: More.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me, I mean, let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all those ones that I mentioned you
had, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had all those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had NL and no, wait, what year did you
call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which year?
[SPEAKER_07]: 94.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm already back, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got big bud Oasis, NL five
Nigerian and the NL.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The super skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: The RFKs are now, they're being,
they're deleted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I came back from Amsterdam,
those are gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before that, I was growing the RFK one
and two and with the chem because I got
[SPEAKER_07]: the chem from Grayden and I had the
sister, the sister plant, the sister
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, whatever he had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't have that for long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I let that go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, also at this time, I had a room with
right after coming back from Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_07]: after the first round.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I make my seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I got a room of a hundred going of the
chem times in Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what, I don't know if this is true
or not, but what the story that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: told, I mean, I think I can say they're
like five by Vondo and swell is that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were getting sacks of weed off you all
1990, all 1994.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then anytime they got a sack off you
that they found a seed, they would just
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in like a little bot, like
everybody did in the nineties or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would just had their little stash of
like seeds I found in Heddy's or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or good nugget in a film canister,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little box, little this top of the sock
drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like the most standard
thing and nobody labeled them carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like good weed for later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said they gathered like 12 or 18
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over the course of a whole year of
buying bud off you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wasn't, it got more than that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, Mike and I had a
conversation, not a text back and forth
[SPEAKER_07]: about like he reminded me, and this is how
we were talking like, Hey, you see one
[SPEAKER_07]: side of the story and I see another side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had to point out to me and I had to
sit there and think about it for like two
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly why we're talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that moment nonstop.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, because it wasn't important to
me that I gave him the bag of seeds,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it was so important to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would have left an impression on
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, I got fucking a hundred
seeds already.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these seeds, I don't want to grow
because they have tendencies to be a math.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were all struggling at this point of
like these RFKs are causing problems,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like they hurt me, get fucking
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is, I don't want to fuck up the
genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm reading in the books how bad
it is, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was trying to like, no, I don't want
that for a breeding program, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: cause that shit was on my mind about
breeding already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, not so Doug, that's the way Vondo
tells the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently listened to a podcast from AJ
and he tells, he tells the story a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit differently and he gives Weasel here
more credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that this story is more
accurate, but you know, we'll see what
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike says.
[SPEAKER_03]: What he says is that he was buying the
sour diesel from Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever the, you know, I think maybe
AJ actually named it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what Mike was actually
selling him at the time, but AJ was saying
[SPEAKER_03]: that, um, Mike was selling him the sour
diesel and that, um, down the line,
[SPEAKER_03]: they found those seeds and that they
planted those seeds because Mike wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: come off of a cut, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean that both, all those things
could be true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, but the point,
my point is, is that the original sour
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel, the seed was from Mike and Vondo
takes credit for it because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he found the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I mean, the story that I was
told and everybody, and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and obviously we got Klopp on so he can,
he can differentiate is that these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: were buying seeds or buying, buying sacks
of weed and they would get, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting sacks of weed and that they would
pick out, they would find some seeds in it
[SPEAKER_02]: because whatever he was, whatever Klopp
was growing had would throw beans on and
[SPEAKER_02]: every now and again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they had this sack of beans that
they had collected over the whole course
[SPEAKER_02]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They planted them and I guess they kept a
couple that they called diesel one and
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess they called it diesel because
that was like the slang for really good
[SPEAKER_02]: weed in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then apparently they took a sack of
diesel two and they gave it to this dude
[SPEAKER_02]: called Manny, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to differentiate it from other
people's diesel, cause diesel wasn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diesel at the time was just a name for
fire weed, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wrote our diesel and Manny thought
that our had an S in front of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently that's where the sour came
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like what they told me was
the sour came was bag seed from weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was bag seed from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys still there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like there was a lot,
you know, for at this time there was a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of sour being sold to these guys,
as much as I could get rid of,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they wanted pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some had occasional seeds,
but I don't think it was, that was,
[SPEAKER_07]: they weren't buying a sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were buying the number two in RFK is
what they were buying.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't say they were buying this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the same now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I had the super skull.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were buying that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I crossed the Northern lights into the
super skunk and I had some weed,
[SPEAKER_07]: half a pound that I didn't want because it
had a whole bunch of season.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't fucking realize at the time,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like fucking, what am I gonna do with a
half a pound of bag and fucking whole
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of seeds?
[SPEAKER_07]: I took out what I want jar like this,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking sold those guys that I caught a
pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or half a pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: With seeds in it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Only people that I could think got that
bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they got so many, somebody got so many
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if it was JJ actually,
or fucking Bondo.
[SPEAKER_03]: JJ or AJ?
[SPEAKER_05]: The sour seeds got out right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: JJ or AJ?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, JJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: AJ really didn't buy too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: He bought weed for me, but he didn't,
he didn't get too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: We would meet at the wetlands.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I more dealt with JJ because it's just
easier.
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's obvious when you look at sour
that it has skunk heritage in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it turns out that, you know,
you had Neville super skunk and you had
[SPEAKER_02]: the Virginia skunk and you had RFK one and
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe like you had a lot more,
you had a plethora of skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: At different times, but you have to also
realize when, as soon as I was growing
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds from Amsterdam, there was no RFK one
and two in a room because I didn't want
[SPEAKER_07]: any.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't worthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't worthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want this anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, there's a bunch of
families of weed that exist only because
[SPEAKER_02]: they had a tendency to herm and throw
accidental bag seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, accidental bag seed is like,
you know, like as much history as I've
[SPEAKER_02]: done, you trace it back and you trace it
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turns out that it's some
accidental bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of, for all the intention we
put into breeding at times, accidental bag
[SPEAKER_02]: seed in the nineties is how like 70% of
cannabis stories begin, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's a big component and we
used to think they're so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I think of them as like the
biggest gem ever because they gave us all
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff on accident that we didn't
realize.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make them, you know, if you want
to do that, you know, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stress out your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it really depends on what's going
to pollen, you know, if it's a natural
[SPEAKER_04]: herm or if it's, you know, manners from
stress or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause as far as I know, um, you know,
when you create your own feminine seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're searching out the plants,
you know, whether it's chemically or what,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's very similar to,
you know, planting the stress out and
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing dinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, one thing that should be mentioned
is that I think that like herms and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm maybe like on a, on a tiny percentage
on this level, but I think herms,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we hate, we, a lot of people despise
them because they want to grow seedless,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that was like a very effective,
like, like breeding method for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if a male died, if something
happened, a lot of genetics hermed because
[SPEAKER_02]: it was another way for the, for like to
make seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only decided like sometime in the
eighties or whatever that we wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: seedless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of a sudden we started trying to
breed out this trait that had been in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for God knows how long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when everyone grew seeded,
right, or you're importing seeded weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: herms did not matter because seeds were
normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only when we started growing
seedless for ourselves that we decided
[SPEAKER_02]: that like, this is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we grow, can we breed away from it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I always would think that the farmer would
yank the male plant out and only
[SPEAKER_07]: selectively bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I actually think like for a long
time too, like the story of American weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, is that all this seeded sativa work
came in as bud, whether it was Panama or
[SPEAKER_02]: Yemenian or Colombian or Mexican or Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that like the Afghan stuff came in as
hash, if you even saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the beginning it was all sativa
stuff because that was the only stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: you had buds that you were going to pull
seeds out of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the rest was turned into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just didn't, and just wasn't shipped
over, you know, like what, like in,
[SPEAKER_02]: import, import weed had free seeds that
came along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got any seedless weed from import.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sometimes I'd get Mexican that was
green and only lightly pressed and it
[SPEAKER_02]: would have few seeds, but it still had
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as far as, as far as they were
concerned, they were still getting the
[SPEAKER_03]: money for the weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I mean, most of the weed,
I mean, most of my high school,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you know, green wheat,
green Mexican was the nice stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: like super compressed Brown Mexican was
the norm, at least for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like, I don't even know if I
would have been able to get good weed
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I have even started growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of my friends, and this is
probably true for Gabby and Klopp or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You started growing weed because you
wanted access to better weed than you
[SPEAKER_02]: could find.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because like occasionally I would come
across some like Florida citrus.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's nice, but I couldn't find
it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and I was, and when I did pay it,
I had to pay, you know, back then,
[SPEAKER_07]: like $40 for a quarter.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, why?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you pay $40 for a quarter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have to leave soon and I want
to get one topic out before you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it might sound like it's a little
off subject, but you gave me the nickname
[SPEAKER_03]: Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta let you know, I don't know if
you've heard, I'm not very happy about
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Staten Island is a fucking shithole.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your shithole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born in Brooklyn and I spent my last
year, hold on, wait, the first time I ever
[SPEAKER_03]: grew weed was in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just rewind a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're telling Canister, because I do
a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes difficult to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not that you want to lie,
but you're talking essentially about
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you might not, how do I put this the
right way?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people do not want to be public
figures, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, they don't want their name out
there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to out your friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to have privacy, they
might've moved on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have a different job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't blame you for giving me a
nickname, but Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is it like the first thing that
came to your head at the moment when you
[SPEAKER_03]: were talking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, if you really want to blame,
oh, I almost said his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to blame it,
who I got it from was when Skunk VA was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to the podcast about his story and
he kept saying my buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_02]: Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to blame him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I mean, we can mutually,
him and I can mutually share blame for
[SPEAKER_02]: popularizing, you know, and all that,
but it's kind of like, yeah, it's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know, you're just trying to talk
about people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times like, you know,
you stop because you're so used to saying
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's name and you want to protect
someone's privacy and maybe they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want their real name out there or
whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, you know, they, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My point in bringing this up, my point in
bringing this up is the weasel.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, we'll have to talk about how
he got that nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that, that might, and that's pretty
shitty too, but he's the real Staten
[SPEAKER_03]: Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was growing first on Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lived there before I lived there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lived there after I lived there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the, he was the man on Staten
Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask these other two dudes a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cosmic and Nick, do you guys know what
AJ's real nickname was?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asshole Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's AJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asshole Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about nicknames is that most of
the time you don't pick them yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are put on you by people in your
circle or your friend group.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put this nickname on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we were good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're calling me like Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're not asshole Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you're not asshole Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, luckily for AJ, AJ is a common
enough nickname that people probably don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think it means asshole Joe, but it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means asshole Joe, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my defense, Gabby, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was starting to talk about you,
you had been retired from growing for some
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were a legitimate business store,
but business store owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like this stuff was long in your past
and I didn't call you up and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you mind if I out you on the internet
for doing a whole bunch of like shady ass
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal shit a long time ago, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just avoided all that by like
talking about you with a name that wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: traced back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you've decided to say your name
and show your face, you're stuck with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, that's kind of, that's kind
of how it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure for, dude, I keep wanting to say
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: His real name, I'm sure skunk VA thought
the same thing when he was trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out how to talk about you five,
six years ago on the podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Without just saying, you know,
Oh, you know, and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't mind that I got a
nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just mind the nickname, but like what it
actually is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that like now I feel pretty
stuck with it, you know, like those are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us about yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people call you weasel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Asshole Joe fucking gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: See it's all shared pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all shared pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason he gave it to me was
because I was like a horde with all the
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he, he like brags on the pot on his
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he sold the shit for like a million
dollars a pound, you know, that he used to
[SPEAKER_03]: get like $1,200 a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not $1,200, $12,000 a pound was something
just ridiculous off the chain,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and he calls you a weasel.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he's, he's on my way from where
I live in another state to come to this
[SPEAKER_07]: house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I told him last week I was coming by.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't pick up this morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get to see him.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to make a stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, he used to sell,
um, you know, he used to sell tops for a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand dollars an ounce and bottoms for
500 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the weasel here wasn't getting paid a
fraction of that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you think you were getting for
it back then?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it wasn't an ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're both for an ounce straight up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting 400 foot all the way up.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had 10 pounds of it, I was getting
400 an ounce all the way up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, that's why like I didn't cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they would turn around and double
it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe says he's, I'm selling it for 800.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing that people
should know is that like back then weed
[SPEAKER_02]: like this was gold because it was so,
it was so rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I mean, growing up in Chicago
and stuff like, uh, he's, uh, he's passed
[SPEAKER_02]: now, but like one of Gabby and I's mutual
friends that I grew up with, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: he used, Sean, he used to like,
you could go up to a spot and you could
[SPEAKER_02]: offer a doorman a hundred bucks and he'd
be like, fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could pull out a small nug of
really nice indoor and hand it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd be like, oh man, you're getting
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was like currency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you knew someone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, I'll tell a story from my past.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how valuable stuff was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might've only been three or four people
away from a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew who they were, but that grower
would sell their herb to a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that friend would go through and like
pick out nug by nug, the nicest half pound
[SPEAKER_02]: that they wanted out of that herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'd sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then they would pick out,
they would pick out and they, the next
[SPEAKER_02]: person that get it would pick it out,
would pick out all the nicest pieces they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted for theirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I would get it, it would be like,
you know, a $50 bag of smalls,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was still better than Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like every nug was gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't matter the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't matter where it was from.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that you could get it,
like that you had access before it ran out
[SPEAKER_02]: was just part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now it's like we're drowning and
it's like a sea of boof everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just drowning in like enormous waves
of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like back then it was like,
it was currency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said it was like gold, but gold wasn't
worth 400 bucks an ounce back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were always like, it was way more
than gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where if you had the money, it was not
guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get kind, but I mean,
part of the reason why, like that story in
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning of like Gabby and Weasel
walking around the lot looking for herb
[SPEAKER_02]: before the show was because dead shows
used to be one of the most reliable places
[SPEAKER_02]: you could stumble upon someone selling a
sack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got him excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody across the country was growing
weed from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people on dead tour were pretty poor
and they needed to, they needed a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: get from show to show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and they needed to make
money somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the traditional ways people
would do it is like, they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if I bring X amount of herb with me,
I can sell eighths and quarters and half
[SPEAKER_02]: ounces and fund my whole run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was people that were going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're walking around the lot,
trying to find someone that was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once people figured out who they
were, that person could sell as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanted that day because it was so
rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you think it affected your
decision in letting us stay at your house?
[SPEAKER_03]: The couple of days that we had good weed,
we had no money, but we had, we had good
[SPEAKER_03]: weed, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was life changing, you know,
it put me back on the, on the,
[SPEAKER_07]: on the, on the dead lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to tie it in, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, the whole chem story starts with him
buying a sack of weed at a dead lot in
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana in 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that same summer, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Colorado and it was in the,
it was, it was at deer Creek and Gabby and
[SPEAKER_02]: that same 91 tour that same summer,
Gabby and weasel walking around,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the RFK, which is obviously in,
you know, on the East coast or whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, RFK stadium looking for
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they found a sack of weed that bag
seed came out of, and that was like on the
[SPEAKER_02]: same summer tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like, that was the standard
was people from all over America,
[SPEAKER_02]: would go on dead tour and you could bump
into Florida people, Colorado people,
[SPEAKER_02]: California people, Montana people,
New York people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was sort of like a cross section.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also anonymous because you
didn't know if you were going to see that
[SPEAKER_02]: person ever again, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but in all, in all honesty,
I mean, like just, just real quick weasel,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you could have bought seeds in
America, would you would have flown to
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I literally, left the country to go
to Holland, you know, so I could find
[SPEAKER_07]: seats anyway, because like for the
culture, I like to travel a lot and I've
[SPEAKER_07]: been to a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, at that time I've already been to
Europe in my life a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you wouldn't have brought seed back to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't have, you wouldn't have taped
the seeds to your package.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You told that story on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You taped the seeds to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Package.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the thing is that that was
where, you know, I mean, when,
[SPEAKER_02]: when Gabby and I first became friends,
it's like, we used to pour over those old
[SPEAKER_02]: catalogs of Neville Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would look at them too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, with him, I would look at them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd look at like, look at that,
look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd memorize, you'd have garlic buds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have different favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have different dreams about going
over there and which ones you'd grab when
[SPEAKER_02]: you were there, because there was just no
access.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were just trying to, you're just
trying to figure out a way that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: get some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only knew how to get it in Holland
and Deadshows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deadshows were like the open air market.
[SPEAKER_07]: But see in Holland, like we, like before
Holland though, like say like,
[SPEAKER_07]: like seven or eight years prior to that
though, I think it was actually 88 or 89.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Operation Green Merchant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a bunch of growers out in
California.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, all the top growers were out in
California growing these skunks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when that went down, they all went
over to Amsterdam and set up business.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were strange, strange dreams here
in this country that were being nicely
[SPEAKER_07]: picked over.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't being distributed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't as like, not just anybody could
go and get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, before the internet,
it was literally like the best way to find
[SPEAKER_02]: better weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say probably the best way in
America to find better weed at that point
[SPEAKER_02]: was to go to a Grateful Dead show and
wander around and make friends and hope
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody you backed into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabby just left, but like, when I first
met him, I'll tell him, I'll tell a story
[SPEAKER_02]: real quick before I got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was this weed that he called the Big
Sur Holy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was these guys on Dead Tour that
sold Big Sur Holy skunk and Big Sur Holy
[SPEAKER_02]: haze, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gabby said the smell was so
distinctive that like, if you walked by
[SPEAKER_02]: someone in the lot that had Big Sur Holy
in their fanny pack, not only could you
[SPEAKER_02]: tell that they had good weed, but you were
pretty sure it was the Big Sur Holy
[SPEAKER_02]: because of how it smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a- And Gabby would always
say they were connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know somebody from the dead family.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was kind of like,
that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to get that weed from him and it
was in little plastic, not plastic,
[SPEAKER_07]: wax paper bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave them to me in wax paper bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sandwich bags for lunches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sandwich bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it smelled so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it just exploded out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why everyone knew you had it
because you were fucking reeking.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave you these stupid sandwich bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to take my daughter to- She has a
little start today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do more soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to take- But it was- It's good to
see your guys' faces, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll do it again soon, I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, let's start off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that guy, Not-So-Dog, an asshole?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm only kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's my bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I wanted to talk to you about,
we had skipped over it because I knew that
[SPEAKER_03]: Not-So-Dog was going to want to talk to
you about the sour, was when we used to go
[SPEAKER_03]: to Ross's, East Coast Hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing I want to say is,
I'm trying to get Ross to do the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: and he tells me that nobody wants to hear
his story and that he doesn't like the way
[SPEAKER_03]: he sounds when he talks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can agree with one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: People want to hear his story.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I can do is not- I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not far from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he don't, then he's out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can ambush him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, ambush him and we'll get him to
talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want him to come here, why I'm here this
week, and say, hey, come hang out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I get him here, I'll try to make a
huge call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a secret camera up and just live
stream him without his permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, he doesn't, you know,
he was such a huge influence to so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, remember,
act and whatnot, so Dog said, a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: people don't want the publicity.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want the camera on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's always been that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can remember how freaky it was,
like, going, not the cops, not the cops.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was because of, you know,
maybe Green- Operation Greenrich.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like they came to his store.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, nothing happened, but you know,
like some of his friends in the operations
[SPEAKER_07]: business there, they got arrested at that
time for selling the equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I want him to tell his story is
because he had that history of going
[SPEAKER_03]: through Operation Greenmerchant and he
survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he continued, you know,
for many years afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sold me he sold me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_03]: He sold me my first light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like when I tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things, Mike, I want to tell
you the purpose of me doing this podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: is that I want to document my story more
for me than for anybody else, because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: forgetting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see, like when we talk,
we remind each other of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to record this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, I don't know if you call
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, we all forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: But listen, my memory is not what it used
to be for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, nobody.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's nice that you want everybody to
know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you ask people about it to help
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it dogs my memory.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you ask me questions, because I think
about it all the time, either like and be
[SPEAKER_07]: like, yeah, that's 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, and you have to sit and
think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you think about this stuff,
it'll come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like like that's why I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said about the bag seat because it took
me a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: We came out of Ross's store and handed him
those seats.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can remember now, you know,
think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, so what I was saying is Ross
is part of my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, East Coast hydroponics,
that's part of my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's our friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, by the way, he doesn't have to
be on screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can just do audio, you know,
like and, you know, as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: concerned, he's a pretty famous dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like you might want to like,
you know, try to be proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's already too late for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many people already know him,
you know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, at the time you think,
oh, my God, this guy's such a pain in the
[SPEAKER_03]: ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, he would leave a sign on
his door saying be back in 15 minutes and
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd come back in an hour and he still
wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, going to the grocery store
back then on Staten Island was shady as
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, we didn't want to have to like go
there, you know, nine times, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get our shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, while he was hanging out in the
back with somebody else smoking weed the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire time while he has a sign saying
back in 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like now, I mean, I honestly love the
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, back then, it was like,
remember, he didn't even go by his real
[SPEAKER_03]: name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went by Bill, you know, like he was so
paranoid that anybody would know his name
[SPEAKER_03]: was Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would call himself Bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is Bill his fucking name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have it backwards?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably would say 10 years before I
knew his first name.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason is because he used my.
[SPEAKER_07]: My kid's grandparents, the father was a
lawyer and he used him as a lawyer,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I was referring to him in a
conversation and.
And.
[SPEAKER_07]: My kid's grandfather corrected me on his
name, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you saying that I don't know what
his real name is or is it no comment?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you know, I think he's a.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an interesting part of both of our
stories, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so he's very interesting
character.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I remember getting like Oasis over
there and we would buy all the down to
[SPEAKER_03]: earth guanos and shit from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: At that time, when he had that small shop,
we were into the guanos, like everything
[SPEAKER_07]: we were doing was backguano, seabird
guano.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the maxi crop powder and promix was
that was stated a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting those bales of promix,
getting those bales of promix was shady as
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, and that's why I was like,
and he's not here, you know, like we
[SPEAKER_03]: borrow a friend's car, you know,
to go over there and have this window in
[SPEAKER_03]: our day to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all like, got our heart racing that
we're going to the hydro store to go buy
[SPEAKER_03]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the guy wouldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody sees you bring it into your
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you how do you hide that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We should.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, it's like this giant bell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a four cubic foot bell,
three point three cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those bells were giant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to like have a little
vegetable garden or something out front
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're just like, oh, no,
this is for my vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: At Mike's first place, there was no grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: He must have like he must have like gone
like to a neighboring woods to go get the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil that he grew in, you know,
because it was cement.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember the pond?
[SPEAKER_07]: I went over to Jack's pond and got it and
brought it back along with spider mites
[SPEAKER_03]: for a scrap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything, every other bug, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably it was I think it would work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, like I said, I still remember that
weed as being the best, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like no, no one on Staten Island at that
point had better weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think I didn't it was
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I like it was definitely different.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was I would think like the seeds were
probably high grade commercial Mexican.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I think it was, but it was
kept short and flowered really,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then but when we got the RFK seeds,
that was the best weed on the island by
[SPEAKER_07]: far at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I couldn't find anything better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, the RFK weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was super nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that we'd still do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like you were you're proud
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring it up a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, it's like the start,
like an indoor, like doing really indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, like changed my life
completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I realized not only you can make a
living at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was when I was like, wow,
like that was the first time you realized
[SPEAKER_03]: that that it was more than just personal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't have to go out there and swing
a hammer anymore if I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to go in the cold freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when was the last time you you grew a
crop this summer?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did this hour and I did the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's I should let you guys ask some
questions since me and not so dog
[SPEAKER_03]: dominated the dominated the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the chem that you guys remember
from like the early 90s?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's the what I did this summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: The chem 91 is the original chem dog from
the 91.
[SPEAKER_07]: The same cut that's been going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it the 91 now to differentiate
it from the chem D and the chem sis and
[SPEAKER_03]: the chem four.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so but back then it was just the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually just called it the dog
because we grew it organic and I refused
[SPEAKER_03]: to call the chem dog chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because I was growing organic at the
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually probably indoor does better
with chem with salts.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why he would be he he called it that
because he couldn't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like he was struggling.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to get it to grow correctly,
he hit it with miracle.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he told me.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll tell the story, too, since it's a
part of both of our stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went and picked up the cut of the
chem dog, he was growing it hydroponically
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called the Emily's Garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like a two by two tray that had
a wick that went to the reservoir below.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the first time I ever saw a
hydroponic system was with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he insisted that you had to grow the
chem dog with hydroponics because it just
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't make it if you didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't survive with just such a hard
plant to feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was the first time I ever saw
a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I refused to accept it when he said that
you can't grow the chem dog organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just called it the dog and I tried
to grow it organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did get flour that people thought
was the best shit they had ever seen in
[SPEAKER_03]: their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was because of the genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that genetic was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you didn't do it right,
you got something really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, now, when I learned about using
mineral salts and became open to it and
[SPEAKER_03]: then grew the chem dog, then it was like,
oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I really got to see what the
potential of this plant was, what the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic potential of this plant was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very difficult plant to feed even
with hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it didn't have much foliage on
it or doesn't have much foliage on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by difficult to feed with hydroponics,
with the knowledge and products that we
[SPEAKER_03]: had at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so the plant would want to
yellow and lose all of its leaves before
[SPEAKER_03]: it finished, you know, and if it didn't
finish, it wouldn't have anywhere near the
[SPEAKER_03]: profile it would have as when it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we fed it with hydroponic
nutrients, it would stay greener longer
[SPEAKER_03]: and the plant could finish and you know,
to me, it's night and day like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I don't object to calling it
the chem dog anymore, because on top of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, it's it's something that
encouraged me to be open to growing with
[SPEAKER_03]: mineral salts, where, you know,
there was a period of time where I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, no, you know, it's got to be
organic.
So.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find the plant is very hard to feed also
when you've got to have the pH just right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I do it in soil outside,
and if I just go with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Straight nitrogen and that guano and and
you know, the mixes that they have,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in the bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plant will struggle to get the proper
nutrients out of even out of the ground,
[SPEAKER_07]: even if I've enriched it and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: But once I add a few salts to the ground
outside and I have a problem with this
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're growing them actually in the
ground?
[SPEAKER_07]: In the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't put them in containers anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a seasonal crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: My soil is beautiful, you know,
and I can go away, which is the main key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not worried.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a sprinkler come on once in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to Italy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I come back and everything looks good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut things back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_07]: This year is really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a nice I have a 30 by 30 plot and I
do pretty good on it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been thinking about a lot
as well, and I don't know if he would do
[SPEAKER_03]: the podcast, but a good buddy,
Keith, you know, have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's very mysteriously.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how often you talk to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really talk to him that often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe like not even once a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to tell everybody else about him,
Keith was or is a good friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was part of the group that was growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm getting some weird sunlight behind
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope it's not too difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like his dad was a pastor, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a priest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had some like conflict within him
about growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, because, you know, it wasn't the holy
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to tell a story about Keith.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you remember any stories and I say
this with all I love the guy immensely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so, you know, sometimes I'd want to
buy weed from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would sell me these bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be really small, like like really
small buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one day I go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, and I thought that's just
the way it was turning out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just small buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one day I go to his house and we go to
his basement to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he breaks out this fucking cola.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I'm like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't believe Keith finally fucking
pulled off something just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like drooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what weed it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's got to be on the show to
ask him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was really dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Keith, why is this shit so dry?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, because I just have it
sitting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he takes a lighter and he's like going
like this, like close to the bottom,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, dude, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, watch goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that flame touches the bud,
the bud was so dry, it fucking ignites
[SPEAKER_03]: like a fucking like a candle goes right
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he fucking takes the end and goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he blows out the flame.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's no longer on fire,
it's just like smoking like a cigar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going like this with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, dude, what the fuck are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, I'm like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're talking about weed is so.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what he said?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was sacrificing it to the gun because
his dad taught him that you should always
[SPEAKER_03]: give a certain amount of money from what
you earn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was tied to the church.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he he couldn't he couldn't like just
take the weed and give it to the church.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he gave the money to the church
because he was making good money,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be like, where the fuck you get
thousands of dollars from?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just totally shady.
[SPEAKER_03]: So his way of giving it back to the earth
was to light that weed on fire and just
[SPEAKER_03]: let it fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have you have any stories or stories
you want to tell about anybody else or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything else you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_07]: And Keith, Keith, I remember, you know,
like people want to know is like like my
[SPEAKER_07]: first round with Keith was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And last.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went over the house one time and he
yelled at me because I went over early in
[SPEAKER_07]: the morning and I'm an early bird.
[SPEAKER_07]: He sleeps to 12.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is where like.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first batch of seeds that I did was
with Keith when I came back from
[SPEAKER_07]: Amsterdam, we did 100 seeds in a room in
his apartment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a pretty interesting journey with
Keith and occasionally I see him,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, him and Ross and I used to go to
a music festival all the time,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it hasn't happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The best story is the one that Gabby told.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we kind of we kind of played
around with the story with Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We told a little bits and pieces,
but I personally don't feel like I have a
[SPEAKER_04]: clear view of, you know, the actual
creation of of the of the Sour Diesel is
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was with Super Skunk and with Chem
Dog, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but the Chem Dog had already been
bred to the northern lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where that round the seeds with
Keith.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're muted, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys hear me now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, now I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was running my water bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people have been saying it's the Chem
Dog crossed with the Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, to a certain extent it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But just so let's play this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where so now I've come back from
Amsterdam and I have the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'm growing seeds and I like
the northern lights, the structure and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything, the size of the color,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like the taste and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I took a male of that plant,
crossed it with the chem.
[SPEAKER_07]: This room that I did with Keith is the
100th seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so the first batch from that batch,
I tell Keith, oh, I like this seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put the number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: We put it into the cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: We grew it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ninety nine plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of them got weeded out because they
were males.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were looking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kept the female.
[SPEAKER_07]: But out of those other seeds that I had
out of the 100 seeds, I grew another batch
[SPEAKER_07]: and I got a male from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same batch and I crossed it with the Super
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's chem lights times or chem times
northern lights times Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where that bag of seeds that
eventually got out that I said earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, there's a whole half pound or a
quarter pound of weed that got out that
[SPEAKER_07]: had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's NL five chem or NL five Super
Skunk to chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or NL five times chem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the NL.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just northern lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one lights that you grew out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like from seed from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like your own pino that you had
hunted yourself that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you used to breed with.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that northern light was bred to the
chem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from the chem took the first
generation of seeds, found the male,
[SPEAKER_07]: crossed it with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was your friend that bought
the weed that had the seed in it that
[SPEAKER_04]: actually grew it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I wouldn't say that like he's
got his seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm growing the same seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, this is how I feel like what happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got these.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my own.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can remember going to the cast guild and
asshole Joe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Moved in to the house across from where
Vondo had at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had two houses side by side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Joe moved in and I gave him a house
warming plant for his house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was my cut of my salad that I had
grown out seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like this plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vondo says or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maxwell says they did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like that's where I have my story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if they say they want to claim it,
they can claim it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought AJ actually gave you the credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in this podcast that I was listening
to, he said that it was your weed and that
[SPEAKER_03]: it was being called the sour diesel and
that and that you wouldn't give up the
[SPEAKER_03]: cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually they found seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And planted those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, but, you know, he said that
yours was the original one and that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, then afterwards, you know,
they grew some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I felt like he was I
felt like he was giving you the credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went back to New York with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the weasel shortly thereafter in
Sheeps Meadow in Central Park,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I I showed it to him and he was so
impressed with it that within two days,
[SPEAKER_00]: he called a flight to Amsterdam and and
took his first trip there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he came back, he had seeds with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would be the seeds that would
eventually potentially father the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that that bore the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, it was it was just
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're getting all these different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everyone's like, dude,
please just grow the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, fuck all this other stuff,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're a grower, like,
you know, like every time you try to show
[SPEAKER_00]: people something different, there's like
one particular thing they want from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like you can't you can show them
the most the best thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did eventually start growing diesel
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but this time when it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by now, these guys who who I had first
introduced to the diesel had had poached
[SPEAKER_00]: out the weasel and found him because it
was, you know, it was a small scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those guys were from Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those guys got weed with some seeds in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found one seed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and so that's kind of like where
it all began with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't listen to his side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't listen to someone else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would have tried to stop by to see
him this morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: How nice to have a fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to see if he wants to come on to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really interacted with him much at
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was already out here and he
was out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had, you know, I knew about
him from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I like you guys kind of floating
around now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gabby, you got to you got to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that you doing tissue culture,
Gabby?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the the clones that I have,
the original Sour Diesel had come had been
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue cultured from someone that I know
that had been growing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got the AJ Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_07]: But was it the sour like was it the sour
like, you know, sour?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to be honest with you,
I don't really know what you grew,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because we're living on
different, different, different sides of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to talk to you about this
after the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting with you know,
you obviously we got the original Sour
[SPEAKER_04]: Diesel here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got, you know, something that came
from, you know, the other side and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I wonder which which sour was
the one that became super popular with
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone that everyone had experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like we already know that even
back then there was a few different ones.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like there were two main ones
that that ended up into like the hands of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were calling it sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could have that could have been
either one either from it kind of very
[SPEAKER_03]: likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It very likely was more than two.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the East Coast sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know too much about the history on
that strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, this what we're talking
about is already originating on the East
[SPEAKER_04]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so the West Coast, I believe,
is the headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't have I don't have as much,
you know, like Francis or not so dog would
[SPEAKER_03]: have been a better person to talk to about
about that because he researches all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's probably already done,
you know, a few talks about it if you look
[SPEAKER_03]: it back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's actually more proof that,
you know, it's kind of like lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: gelato today.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people just start to add their
shit to the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the when they started calling
the headband sour diesel, it's like just
[SPEAKER_03]: because that you know, that was more
popular than headband, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but and, you know, I will talk to not
so dog about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clone that I have I believe to be the
original sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have the AJ Sauer, which is
actually something that he you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he agreed to put his name on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they call it the Philly cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's put his name on a on a
bunch of cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but you know, and now he has,
you know, his whole AJ Sauer line,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so now he has his own sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do you get royalties?
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if it's like the weasel on a jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I get royalties for that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I don't think you I swear
to God, like someone does that.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy is someone doing that a nice,
nice man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's got this sour that he says is
sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say it right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's selling it as sour and grown by
the weasel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, and he comes to me,
look, I says I did this for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, I don't know what to say to
the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did this for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where's my money?
[SPEAKER_03]: No,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using you're using my reputation to
sell your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like all lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna meet with him soon again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't have time right this minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna Well, first of all, it shouldn't
say grown by the weasel because now he's
[SPEAKER_07]: taking credit for like, I'm not I'm not
saying that, you know, product at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, this can't this can't be.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to break it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just too kind hearted in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you like the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says it goes to a lot of cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't, you know, like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to a good cause if he's
doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cancer, cancer patients don't care
that you grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, that's marketing calling
it, you know, saying grown by the weasel
[SPEAKER_03]: because cancer patients just want medicine
that makes them feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it doesn't matter to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's sour diesel grown by the weasel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the same cut of sour ever since
Yeah, you know, originally created it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my buddy here in the Catskills has it
also.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's from Staten Island crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's kind of funny, like the guys
from Albany lived here for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we came here, you know,
into the Catskills.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, so this is kind of like Humboldt
County, in a way as to what we say,
[SPEAKER_07]: Green County is like the humble of the
East County and the East Eastern United
[SPEAKER_07]: States, like this area, a lot of fine bud
coming out of here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always was like, for the New York weed,
that's where with all the good shit was
[SPEAKER_08]: always coming from my friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I just asked him in the spring,
can I get a cut?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I get the cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I do see Cosmo cosmic, you know,
what about you?
[SPEAKER_04]: So your friend currently, he's kind of
like the caregiver of your strain right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like you don't perpetually have a
mother, he's the one who's taking care of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got a quite a few things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have someone that's supposed to be sour
diesel that I'd gotten back in 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: From this breeder collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm over here in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this breeder collective in San
Bernardino that just kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't really trace the history back
on what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turps are extremely sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as far as what I understand what a
sour diesel should be, it seems pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: close to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, who knows if it's if it's
the real deal, you know that, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, I have I have quite the
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been learning a lot about tissue
culture about Mary stem tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my focus right now is getting better at
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, hopefully creating a
library of strains that I can kind of play
[SPEAKER_04]: around with whenever I'm ready for my next
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have both of the sours that I that
I have currently in our stem, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have the two sours I got from you and
then I have the one still that I had from
[SPEAKER_04]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I mean, the Mary stem process is
it's very, very long.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take a long time for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I'm I'm still in the
process of figuring everything out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know it was a different show
that we did, but I've successfully done
[SPEAKER_04]: the micro propagation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've successfully right now at this point
have extracted, you know, a lot of Mary
[SPEAKER_04]: stems and I have them currently growing,
getting to the point where they're almost
[SPEAKER_04]: at the height where I would be able to
kind of do the same techniques that I use
[SPEAKER_04]: with micro propagation on on those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now my my current process is
connecting those two techniques together
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to, you know, eventually have a
plant that you can grow in a garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so but yeah, my collection is
vast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm around 90 or so and about half
of those, if not more, are already just
[SPEAKER_04]: purely tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the Chem 91, I have that
supposed to be on the way too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love sours.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love chems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any kind of those strains where you're
just like, it's not it's not so friendly
[SPEAKER_04]: to to, you know, just sniff it there,
the turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, it's been so so awesome
to be able to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, here we're one of my
favorite strains came from, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I know everyone's a little bit
different, you know, with what they
[SPEAKER_04]: prefer, you know, and I feel like it has
to do with everyone's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: biology and like the chemical composition
of their brains and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what what cannabinoids and terpenes that
they react to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know personally, sour diesel is one
of my favorites for just putting me in the
[SPEAKER_04]: best mood.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a great mood enhancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I find I like smoking it better in the day
when I'm working and then the chem dog
[SPEAKER_07]: because chem dog would just couch couch
potato me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be like, I got to sit down soon
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had any actual.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because it's funny because I
feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people, you know, Cosmic and Wolf,
you can tell me your feelings on the
[SPEAKER_03]: subject, but people would always tell me
how the sour diesel would wreck them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, it was just never that potent,
even when done properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The comparison of the potency,
not THC, but just overall potency to your
[SPEAKER_03]: brain, like the difference between smoking
the sour or the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's night and day, you know,
and maybe maybe it could also have
[SPEAKER_03]: something to do with, you know,
if there was some more sativa in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you growing too,
Nick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have like a little tiny home grow and
then just because where we moved,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I help manage a farm as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got like four different flowering
rooms and we have, I think we have like
[SPEAKER_01]: 108 or 116 different cultivars that we
keep on on hand now, but we're also moving
[SPEAKER_01]: to get some tissue cultures set up so that
we can get all of all of those on culture
[SPEAKER_01]: because keeping 108 strains on on hand is
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like two acres of outdoor that we
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to like split up all those two
acres between about 102 or 105 different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains per year.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing them outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do row crops with drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no protection?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do like T-posts and trellising.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're doing out like up here
there was, we had like 35 of them this
[SPEAKER_07]: summer over on a farm and we put them on
skids and then on big bags and then we
[SPEAKER_07]: just keep the brush back and we bring
water lines, drip lines to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I find that you have to be outdoors
and you're bringing the water from far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we have a reservoir, it's a spring,
so it's kind of hard really to run the
[SPEAKER_07]: drip line.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just, we feed it with a hose most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't use trellises so much because
like we're, I don't know, like far apart
[SPEAKER_07]: when you use large stakes and just kind of
tie them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the trellises, like a lot of
people like them in the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I just find that sometimes it's not
the ideal thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do either of you guys do anything
different?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that, Gabby?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I mean we have like 3,500 plants
in the two acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like putting tea or putting stakes
for each one of those would just be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit too laborious.
I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't use a lot of stakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just use like one maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: This year I didn't have to use holly any,
but we get enough wind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like they strengthen them and I
don't have a problem with them falling
[SPEAKER_07]: over and you know, like this, the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of just stay up to strong the
stems, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you asking Gabby though about
like protection?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys do anything to protect them
from the weather?
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like is it just grown straight outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just straight outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We use like, we use an electrostatic
sprayer on the back of a tractor and spray
[SPEAKER_01]: like biologicals and stuff to help prevent
like botrytis and powdery mildew and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the hemp russet mites are
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to battle those throughout the
whole season too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year we didn't have much like
thrips or spider mites or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like the hemp russet mites and
a little bit of powdery mildew towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking protection from the wind
and rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That trellising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get some pretty intense winds in the
valley that we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll we have like probably three
layers of trellis per row and the rows are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's like two rows down straight
planted at like five foot centers per
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have the T-post just running
along the outside and then we'll just pull
[SPEAKER_01]: the trellis along the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, the weather is a lot different
out there than here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it snows where you're at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not far from U2 though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get snow here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's far enough from where I live that I
don't have to worry about it snowing on my
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know like you guys are, that's a big
business that you guys you're in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know we're just like small craft
farmer here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's funny that you say that
because we had that discussion about what
[SPEAKER_03]: is craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could never like you know once you get
like above 40 plants for a single person
[SPEAKER_07]: to work it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's becomes a full-time job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is and you already have one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know you already have one of those
right Mike?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Family's another full-time job.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like you're working a lot of hours
trying to take care of this plant and
[SPEAKER_07]: you're not getting as much as you used to
get for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I'm only gonna grow like a small
amount depending to what I used to
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like I don't care about selling it
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: More about personal fun and giving it to
some people that don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to use a lot of automation and
irrigation because it's only two of us
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much that are full-time there
taking care of four different rooms of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and a few different veg spaces
because of all the moms that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep around and clone room and that's but
I think it's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you were in a facility too right
Gabby?
[SPEAKER_07]: You were working in one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you were though.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of like the large
facilities?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I believe and I said this before
and I'll repeat it is that I believe it's
[SPEAKER_03]: possible to grow on a large scale and grow
craft quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's probably less profitable right
because if it was more profitable then
[SPEAKER_03]: more people would be trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if what you're trying to do is and
we're talking about large-scale right if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're trying to create a brand known for
the highest quality then you can't cut
[SPEAKER_03]: those corners and you got to accept that
like at least at first it might not be as
[SPEAKER_03]: profitable right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think if you go in there with the
proper intention and love for the plant in
[SPEAKER_03]: a commercial facility you can grow the
highest quality product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know one thing that that I would
say about this is in a commercial facility
[SPEAKER_03]: they regularly have tools available to
them that the average you know craft
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer does not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like the amount of monitoring and
controls that are available to these
[SPEAKER_03]: larger facilities it's an advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I think a lot of these facilities are
overusing this technology and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: push the plants too hard and that's
causing other problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a commercial facility can grow as
good of weed as anyone else can if they
[SPEAKER_03]: put the proper love and it's attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you have a commercial facility you
got to have enough people working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have enough people working
there then all of a sudden corners get
[SPEAKER_03]: cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know if you can have enough people
working there they can put more attention
[SPEAKER_03]: into it than in a situation where it's
just like one or two people working you
[SPEAKER_03]: know for flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the flowering rooms are huge you
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah I mean the last place I was at the
flowering rooms each of them had like 130
[SPEAKER_03]: lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 117 lights something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like 1200 plants in every room and
there was eight rooms plus the veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have 12 lights per room and around
108 plants per room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to just wrap it up and you
know is there anything else that you
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to say Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good you got anything you want to ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I'm gonna talk to you for the rest of
my life so I can ask more questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give Nick and Cosmic a chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have anything you want to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I think I've asked every question
that came to mind right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably just gonna be a matter of
just digesting you know everything that
[SPEAKER_04]: we've learned today you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of really cool cannabis history
you know especially strains that you know
[SPEAKER_04]: that we all love you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your favorite today I mean besides
the sour to diesel like something else
[SPEAKER_08]: that you like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly yeah I mean sour diesel it's so
hard to beat sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love SFEOG that's one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a story for another day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually my buddy that I did this with
about 15 years ago was at my house this
[SPEAKER_04]: weekend and I asked him if he wanted to
jump on his podcast so that's maybe maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: down the line we can hear the story from
his perspective but back in the day him
[SPEAKER_04]: and his mom were just about 2011 or so
2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: They started a cannabis club you know so
like a medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had all the paperwork done
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were legal to grow at his house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a single room that we're taking
care of and I at the time I was delivering
[SPEAKER_04]: pizzas you know I put all the extra money
I had you know because he still wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: get money from that room so we had to pay
rent for the room that we were growing in
[SPEAKER_04]: so I paid all that extra money I had for
you know rent every month on that and then
[SPEAKER_04]: all the equipment that we needed but long
story short he ended up getting raided.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a whole deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting story too again I just we
were talking about on Friday so I'm hoping
[SPEAKER_04]: that we can get him on and get him to tell
his end of that but back to kind of what
[SPEAKER_04]: we were we were talking about SFEOG was
one of the strains that we grew back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day so I have that personal connection
from you know basically the the first time
[SPEAKER_04]: of me really you know learning how to grow
and then you know taking on you know a
[SPEAKER_04]: room with my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: San Fernando has always just been one of
my favorite OGs and then as far as like
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of modern weed goes another favorite
actually I'll do a shout out for two more
[SPEAKER_04]: strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is blueberry muffin from Humboldt
amazingly fruity almost too sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're trimming up the plant it it's
almost sickeningly sweet but it's a really
[SPEAKER_04]: good nighttime smoke that blueberry muffin
and I've used it for several of my
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding projects some really interesting
results and then another one that I that
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been growing again since 2020 is
sugar cane from in-house genetics really
[SPEAKER_04]: really good hash plant you know lots of
lots of frost on it so perfect for making
[SPEAKER_04]: bubble hash or any kind of extracts and
everything like that so I'd say those are
[SPEAKER_04]: some of my top strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice and you Nick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man I'm just because of like the volume
of different strains that I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to over the past couple years like
it they start to get muddled but one that
[SPEAKER_01]: always that I really like because of like
the medicinal qualities of it for my
[SPEAKER_01]: specific usage would be like Miracle Alien
cookies or the Mac one cut that one and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's a cross of it where it was
crossed to the in-house genetics slur cane
[SPEAKER_01]: and that one's either called like Mac
slurry or Mac flurry or Mac daddy but that
[SPEAKER_01]: that one also is it's a just a huge
yielder and it's really potent so those
[SPEAKER_01]: are always good for me but then I do
remember like Tahoe OG or San Fernando
[SPEAKER_01]: like SFV OG or even just like OG Kush like
any OG is I'm down with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey you know that alien cookies I used
that in breeding I like it's nice I
[SPEAKER_07]: actually backbred it into my underdog and
use it to get a mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to end this pretty quickly I just
want to add to what you just said I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone called the P85 it's the Pluto times
the E85 and I'm gonna send you a cut Mike
[SPEAKER_03]: to thank or I could send it to your buddy
that that's holding on to your genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: till spring but uh it's an amazing plant
for growing indoors or outside to me it
[SPEAKER_03]: checks all the boxes and I'll send you a
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you buddy and I appreciate you
doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice meeting you guys all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super nice meeting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are doing more than I ever did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got how many strains each one of these
gotta and so much today you guys are so
[SPEAKER_07]: much more advanced than I ever was and
still are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're standing on the shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys went to school for it right you
guys took courses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading and lots of hands on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can learn anything by reading and just
hands on man so long as you can get
[SPEAKER_07]: something to show you something you know
in it and that's really what it is
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody to guide you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget to leave the browser window
open when we hang up so that this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: fully records and I love you Mike I'll
talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: See ya.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you later.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: you
