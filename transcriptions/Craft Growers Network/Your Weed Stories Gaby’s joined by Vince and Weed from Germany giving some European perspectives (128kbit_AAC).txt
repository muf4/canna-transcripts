[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Your Weed Stories on the Craft
Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very excited today because today is
another international edition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say our first, but our
first international edition, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: was with Sasha, our Slovenian Hobbit,
who now has become our co-host.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we reached out to Vincent because we
heard that he's a really well-known in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany and Germany is a place we're very
interested in with the new cannabis laws
[SPEAKER_03]: that have taken place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Vincent, you can find him on Instagram
at... I'm sorry, Vincent, I pulled it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vince and Weed with two 3s because of the
censorship, but you find me on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's V-I-N-C-E-A-N-D-W-3-3-D.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of the E's, we have two 3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on YouTube, it's just Vincent
Weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for example, on YouTube,
he's got 147,000 subscribers and on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram, it's 33,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of people want to hear what
Vincent has to say, including us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, Vincent, welcome to our show and
tell us your weed story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us how you began and then we'll move
forward to closer to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you both for the invitation to your
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I came here as a guest today with no
expectations and you asked your guests for
[SPEAKER_00]: their story and I'm completely unprepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be from the bottom of my heart and
I got goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I see myself as a regular
guy who loves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't claim that I'm a pro, but I would
say I'm a student for a lifetime who is
[SPEAKER_00]: curious and who is really thankful about
what he was able to learn through
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which my teachers never have
been able to teach me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe later a little bit more for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me just stop and tell you that
you already fit in with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly how we try to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to not have egos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learn on every single podcast from our
guests and yeah, I mean, like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: you already fit right in with us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did my way with cannabis started?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, I was a regular smoker and
during my time when I was in university,
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of the German weed became so
poor and also the people were putting
[SPEAKER_00]: additives to bring more weight to the
black market weed in Germany with all
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds, with sand, with crushed
glass, with also with hairspray and all
[SPEAKER_00]: really disgusting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a period where there was time
where I had to write my exams and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a little bit of weed and I found a
backseat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also with this, a lot of
people will relate their story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same on my side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nothing special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a backseat and there was a plant,
a regular house plant in my window and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, okay, throw the seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping studying and three days later,
I found something on the top of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: layer, crying for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was my life changing moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did everything possible to give this
small little plant everything I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: she would need to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built from cardboard my first grow box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went straight into the internet during
this time social media was not existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the time of the forums,
the boards and yeah, this was 2010,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, from what I learned in this
forums, the people who welcomed me also
[SPEAKER_00]: with the people were a little bit grumpy
because you asked the question the 100th
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but which people inspired me till
today are the people who are the OGs or
[SPEAKER_00]: have been in this boards and answering the
questions of the beginner till today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I was so thankful for all this
knowledge that yeah, today and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the path to where I'm standing
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This inspiration is keeping me every day,
educating the knowledge I never claim my
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's knowledge which is there in the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great teachers, some personal teachers in
my life, but also a lot of people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: been teaching the masses through the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm one of the students and just
keeping this cycle alive and spreading all
[SPEAKER_00]: this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this was the beginning of my
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during study time, bad weed,
starting to grow your own, get goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much happened during this years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just ask a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you said that you were on the forums,
it was 100% in English?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I was in German, there would have
been two boards, two forums in German.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure, I see Mac, one of the most
important boards in my life, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Germany, there have been two
relevant forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one was called grower.ch for Swiss
because for the safety was in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoia time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one was called hamf.ch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this have been the most
influential boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we talked before we started the
podcast, I speak German, Spanish and
[SPEAKER_00]: English.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during this time, also the internet
was so small compared to today that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: really absorbing the knowledge in three
different languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, goosebumps really completely my
whole body because now that I'm talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get reminded of during this beginning
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and this was the beginning,
reading in three languages, absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything about cannabis and starting to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I start to learn so much
about biology, chemistry, physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was studying economics, but after this
small little plant germinated in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, in the window, I studied cannabis
by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can claim that since then, since 2010,
I can say every day at least one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours reading and learning about this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the Hamburg was created by a
guy who is actually a German guy was
[SPEAKER_01]: called Dr. Knospel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Dr. Knospel, Rest in Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: He died really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also influenced with some of his
genetics, the German cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also, we still have some cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have the jagging cut,
for example, you know that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack, Jack Flash, number five from census
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is like offsprings from that,
you know, which is green has seen and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, yeah, you know, some, some guys did
some pollination with that because the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the Jagan was a producer still is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still, it's a little bit in the
background today because the American
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics now are more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but there is, there is shops that
still have these genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the plant that, that Dr. Knospel
put out still alive is still around,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, yeah, it's a, it's, it's a
building block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people are still requesting this
cuts also in the shops in Austria where
[SPEAKER_00]: they sell cuttings and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is also from the, from the older
generations, a lot of people who are now
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting to get their hands again on this
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how met, how, how I met Gabby,
I met Gabby through the search for the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem doc, you know, I was looking for the
chem doc because Gabby is directly related
[SPEAKER_01]: to you know, to giving it to other people
who are now having it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's like the chem doc is a
legend in USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem doc is one of the, I say there
are certain backbone genetics where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that so many other crosses have
been created with that and chem unique
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who knows the original who gets
also blind his nose on a jar immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize the chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: My theory is that the old OGs come from
the chem, you know, like not all,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's really related to OG plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG Kusch that we first had,
it's like all, it has all chem doc in
[SPEAKER_01]: behind of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all chem doc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, out cross and back crosses
and, but we are, we are all on in this
[SPEAKER_01]: part, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me which place did you grow
up in Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I have been growing up in the North.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, my childhood was in Mexico because
my dad worked there, but when I,
[SPEAKER_00]: we came back with six years, I was growing
up in Braunschweig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also where I'm now after living in
a lot of different places in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found my wife in my hometown visiting my
parents and yeah, now I'm back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to grow at the Northern,
the coast in Germany where I was studying
[SPEAKER_00]: really cold, wet climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also immediately tried outdoor in
all different growth styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm, I'm a Nordish guy in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nordish by nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some friends in Germany,
but they're, they're both in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, I would also say Berlin is in
the Northern part of German, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't call themselves I'm a Nordish
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Braunschweig is like the last thing
where you say I'm North from there it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes the center of Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after this seed, so you started to
realize genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were, you were searching for,
for, for genes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, because if you, if it was a
backseat, so after that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: reading through the forums, you saw all of
these strains, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first initial search for
which, which genetics have you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been interested in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I was using a page which is
still today, one of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: pages for research for genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called seed finder you it's in
different languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can recommend to have a look
because there you really can see where all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different line ages influenced the
next genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this was the time where Europe
and the states have been still really
[SPEAKER_00]: separated from my today perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really the time where you could say
European genetics and US or American
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been really the time of the
skunk, the, the outer genetic I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, Friesian dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it was the, the basic genetic
stock still Northern lights, haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of face, but I'm not the
haze guy to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was really the beginning
where, where I remember when I went on
[SPEAKER_00]: seed finder you, I saw the number of how
many strains have been listed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something around 7,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have been, it was still possible to
get an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then it came the time for me
where I was traveling a lot of weekends to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam to go there, to go to area,
to gray area and shops like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a glimpse of the genetics in which
have been growing in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it opened my whole perspective because
now for sure both sides have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: both gene pools, but it's, this was really
a time where it still was separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I remember my first time being in
Amsterdam and smelling some real orange
[SPEAKER_00]: turps with the, with the influence of
crooked with the Tangy with was across
[SPEAKER_00]: which da DNA made Tangy with kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a kosher Kush lava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody told me there is
something it tastes like orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the first help, which somebody
told me there you find the 24 K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my, my moment where I got my
nose into this bag and it was really,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, this is orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time straight orange and
smoking this completely freaking out and
[SPEAKER_00]: straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember how I asked, how do I get the
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to work from the,
from the bottom of Amsterdam to the left
[SPEAKER_00]: side to the DNA genetics shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought the pack of seeds and I went
home and I selected my own first 24 K gold
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Tangy direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my time where, where I really
started to, to combine both worlds of
[SPEAKER_00]: European and the, the States and yeah,
crazy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, and then it, for me, like you
said that the champ genetic is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: important backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember then when the first rumors of
the cookie is genetics came to Europe and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody was asking what is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low yield are crazy turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I have to say that the European
genetics also AK 47, all the stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: big, but orange, but they have been also a
little bit more on the yield side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more during this time that for me,
I, I started to grow because I wanted to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow my own supply, but I wasn't
completely into the word of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This started, like I said, in Amsterdam
when I had the possibility to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to get a broader palette of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was more for big yielder,
but this changed completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the cookie cookies genetics came
over to, to Europe and I have to say I was
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting because I wasn't that well
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hunting the cookie genetics like two
and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it in gray area, but I didn't get
my hands on a cut or a German grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or who was growing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this changed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that cookie, the cookie
genetics brought me to understand that I
[SPEAKER_00]: will also sacrifice yield for better
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a huge shift in my
perspective on growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, it really started that I
wanted to, to know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that is a really important thing
that you said now, because it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: today like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you have these old cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, Big Bot, White Widow,
AK 47s, Critical Plus, all these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have, for example,
all the American cuts now, Apple Banana,
[SPEAKER_01]: ice cream runs, Detroit runs, you know,
all kind of Skittles crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and this is exactly the term what we
first started to see was the yield was
[SPEAKER_01]: lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the bots were harder, heavier,
but it was not so much yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was on yield in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Holland, everything was bred for you,
you know, black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be efficient, a lot of money
turnover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the story changed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think there's something else that
could have influenced that, for instance,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't know about Germany,
but I want to ask, but in Holland,
[SPEAKER_03]: they all mix tobacco with their weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they did, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're mixing tobacco with your
weed, then all of a sudden, the way it
[SPEAKER_03]: tastes doesn't matter so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I, I'd like to say what,
you know, my feelings on it and what I
[SPEAKER_03]: always mentioned to my Dutch friends is,
you know, you have this beautiful plate of
[SPEAKER_03]: food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, if you have a beautiful plate
of food, you go to a nice restaurant,
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful plate of food, and you take a
shit on it before you eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so, and, you know,
the few friends that I have from Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I, you know, I don't, I'm not in
contact with them as much anymore,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they all used to mix tobacco with
their weed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me too, a lot of, I would say the main
part of my stoner life, but it changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now, since one year, I stopped to
smoke tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really went to vaping and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, combustion is still something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it, it's a social thing with the
right guys, with the right, it has to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, if it's, if it's the really,
the best weed and the right person,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will smoke a joint with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to be truthful, since I'm
vaping and dabbing so much, combustion
[SPEAKER_00]: became really wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have a completely new
relationship with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought, I call it, it's like,
I've been married 25 years, smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been married with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already has been normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk to each other, but we don't really
pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I stopped smoking tobacco,
and I really reduced combustion to two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three percent of my consumption,
my relationship with cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tell the people don't
smoke with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in Europe has his, yeah,
his own story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the culture of smoking with
tobacco is still big, but it's a shift
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people, because now they are really
starving for quality and their
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding for pure smoke is really
growing also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will also later talk about the new
situation in Germany with the
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, my mission, mission is,
and this is really good that I stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking that much a year ago, is now that
I also can tell the people as not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not telling them what to do, showing them
how I consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling the people, if you are a
first time user now, because you as a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer are legal, please try not to
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use vapes and dabs and stay away from
burning if you never have been smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my approach at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for sure, I also burn some good pure
joints and donuts with my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we say that we don't want to be
influencers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be inspires.
[SPEAKER_03]: Educators and inspiring the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the biggest shift you can
create in other people is not telling them
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living, in Germany, we say, lebe es ihnen
vor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live it and show them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect is much bigger and also
have a much longer effect on the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you something, I'm
streaming also on Twitch and we have like
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 people on average in the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was using here a ball vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been a pipe smoker and this device
changed my life because I can smoke still
[SPEAKER_00]: or I can vape a pipe with a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I call it vegan smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my chat, so many people are writing
me that they stopped smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's life changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when then I read that they are nearly
quitting combustion, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's all about a healthy
relationship with this plant and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question and a comment about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'll give you the comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also predominantly vape now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why is because and so in
the past, I'd wake up in the morning and I
[SPEAKER_03]: would roll 10 joints.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a case that would hold five
joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had two of them so I could leave
with with 10 joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'd probably smoke five to
seven of them, but I always had a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: extra in case I'm with other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I share weed, I don't want to share
mouth to mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like to me, it's just it's most
mostly unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if we were going to have a beer,
we wouldn't buy one beer and share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an abundance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, where I'm coming from,
there's such an abundance of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would we ever share a joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I just give you a joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to have 10 joints a day and I
smelt like an ashtray everywhere that I
[SPEAKER_03]: went.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I was young and I didn't
give a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now thinking about it's like I kind of
smell pretty dirty, you know, just like
[SPEAKER_03]: always smelling like a roach, not even
smelling of fresh weed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh weed smells beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your ashtray, not so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had tried vape carts, but they were
all shitty, you know, because they're all
[SPEAKER_03]: distillate, you know, with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back then it was distillate and they
would flavor it with herbs, even cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I discovered something and I
discovered fresh frozen sauce turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what sauce is, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is now this is the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, the good thing is that technology is
so far ahead now that really the end
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, the home grower can buy these
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good thing is, and this is this is
really changing the whole game,
[SPEAKER_00]: that even high quality flour rosin is able
now to with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know to say this in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no coil anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my community is really making their own
pans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's completely different to what you
told before the distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I understand your approach
completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to so this is sauce turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those that don't know,
when they make sauce or diamonds with
[SPEAKER_03]: butane and this is made with fresh frozen
flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they make it with butane in the
process, the THC falls to the bottom and
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpenes will rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the terpenes on the top are so
valuable that what they do is they pour it
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nowadays, when you buy a cart and it's
flavored with with terpenes like this
[SPEAKER_03]: sauce turps, they'll put a small
percentage in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they just want to add flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I buy the turps straight and I should
go and grab a jar and or a couple of jars
[SPEAKER_03]: and show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go say hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so I fill these carts with straight
sauce turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the regular carts that are available
at a dispensary are maybe like 85 percent
[SPEAKER_03]: THC because they're made with either
distillate or the now they they melt the
[SPEAKER_03]: diamonds and turn the diamonds into
something that can be consumed in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this has about 40 percent THC,
maybe 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the terpenes are through the roof,
like 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I smoke this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the way it tastes is just so I can
tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two thousand and twelve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, two thousand and nine, two thousand
and ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with growing and immediately
the the curiosity for all around this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and culture started to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for dabbing at 2010, 2012,
the time Titan needles, glass dome with
[SPEAKER_00]: glass needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this time of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I went to a to a really good
extraction art, not artist, a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor in Berlin, 2012, because I
wanted to taste the first time B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to see where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me when I arrived,
do you want a small one or do you want a
[SPEAKER_00]: big mac, a big dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me, I have to tell you
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I smoked so many extracts that I lost my
passion and taste for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will give you one advice.
Don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consume so much extracts that you lose
your passion for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since 2012, this is in my head and I'm
really thankful this gave me because I
[SPEAKER_00]: have ADHD and sometimes you go crazy with
this handicap or with the superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially sometimes you go crazy with
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was the best advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I because I love this plant so much and
the flower till today, I never got into
[SPEAKER_00]: this situation because I have his voice
till today in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important that we talk
about something like that, because people
[SPEAKER_00]: who start with consuming extracts,
they have to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is I'm a medical patient,
but also a recreational user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do I differentiate during the
week?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to function really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're my approach or my goal is to
have a level of cannabinoids in my system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which let me be relaxed with my movement,
but clear my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, it's less than I fought the
first years of being medical user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dabbing extracts is something I
take for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for me, for sure, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who can handle it really
well and smoke every day a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: dab, one dab or two dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know I like the taste too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's really something when
Friday or Saturday or Sunday, this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that space to enjoy and to get into
the artwork of extracts I'm consuming in
[SPEAKER_00]: this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so during the week, you're vaping
flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, vaping strictly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No smoking anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to see the tools that you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of my at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go take a second and find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to go bring some extract to
show you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty, Vincent.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I want you to show us your tools
that you use to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I'm using three different
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I use a ball vape with a rig
or with a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I was 25 years pipe smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really changed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have such a huge heat
retention capacity and also the with the
[SPEAKER_00]: balls which are inside of this coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring in one hit, the whole heat onto
the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this what what I at the beginning,
why I never started to vape was I hate
[SPEAKER_00]: seven minute sessions to get out all the
ingredients of a little bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the moment, I found DynaVap or a
ball vape or also this electronic vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because usually till I would say two years
ago, all the electronic devices also just
[SPEAKER_00]: went to 210 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know in Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one can go to 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really close to combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be true for me, it's more OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the studies that if you vape
that high, also some cancer coursing
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's it's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to to burn than burning and
smoking a bush fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I feel at the moment when I'm
smoking too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then vaping on a really high temperature
and also the DynaVap is for me the joint I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my pipe I was using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'm completely satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the thing that you have that has a
cord on it, that's the heating element.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't put the weed in here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the weed in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see it's nearly burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really I am the guy who vapes really
high temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is just missing the.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put my finger on here and then the
heat comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet you have a it's a thermal
extraction device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you the the difference to the older
devices that these devices I'm using have
[SPEAKER_00]: the capability of extracting quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives you and also also build up
big clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives you the satisfying pressure
on the lung and also the quick feeling of
[SPEAKER_00]: the of the effect of the cannabinoids and
the terpenes and the easters and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this changed everything for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have I don't have to wait,
which was usually with the old vape
[SPEAKER_00]: devices, which with my ADHD, I'm
impatient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and does that thing heat up quickly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three minutes with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really I know that I need some
medication in the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I press my button.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at home, I also use all different
kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a traditional ever with torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there are different ways to to use
still your quartz banger without a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, this is my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm when I'm on the go, I prefer some
digital press the bottom devices from
[SPEAKER_00]: different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm home, I really like to sit
down because for me, extracts is something
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, we don't have a market now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are in touch with other
extraction artists or you get your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on certain batches, for me, rosin is an
art and I take it seriously with
[SPEAKER_00]: functional art and consuming art through a
piece of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that how extract comes into my
hands means somebody have been selecting a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic war, growing it, washing it,
pressing it and curing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get a piece of art and then I take
also at the weekend my time to consume it
[SPEAKER_00]: through a nice piece and to be with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hear what you say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to make the best rosin, it definitely
takes a little bit more of a, as you said,
[SPEAKER_03]: artistic touch than with butane,
for instance, with butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about following this process,
which is, you know, it's science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so but yeah, I thank you for
breaking out your tools because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: interested because I want to vape more
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have to tell you something.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why a ball vape is really building a wave
at the moment in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you something I never thought I
will be able to say with such a device and
[SPEAKER_00]: please don't look at me with the big pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my tool here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go with a small rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can use it with a regular or a
little bit bigger rig and you will
[SPEAKER_00]: experience wheat on a taste level close
under maybe 0.5 away with a gap to
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts to the, I would say, okay,
flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in the States that people say flour
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Germany, you have to understand we
have a huge homegrown culture and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people saw extracts on Instagram and they
wanted to have their hands on their own
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quickest way to educate the people
is flour rosin and then showing them how
[SPEAKER_00]: to wash hash and then they never do flour
rosin again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to say, okay, flour rosin
is just a small gap to this with 0.4 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of wheat in this bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will call me and tell me what vaping
is so tasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here you can put a lot of flour in
and like I said, the first hit is really
[SPEAKER_00]: all the terpenes and nearly not all but a
huge amount of cannabinoids get evaporated
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get the taste on your lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: No combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really an advocate for ball vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really from the bottom of my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this device.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, when we talked about how I get
inspired every show, you're inspiring me
[SPEAKER_03]: to go out and buy a ball vape because I
don't have one and I do enjoy flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To give you an example, when I dab,
I like to do it at a very low temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is your temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I use a torch, but I like to do
a cold start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much don't let it get that hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll stop smoking before I'm even done
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like when you get that giant dab
and it chokes you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were gonna tell your story about your
first dab and then I think it got
[SPEAKER_03]: interrupted by yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to tell you quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I did my first dab, my friend gave me
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like the tiniest little bit on
this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I did the dab, I literally thought I
was gonna pass out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was dizzy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to sit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That never happens from weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I dab, I also want a tiny little dab
because I just want to taste it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm gonna get high no matter what
because the concentration is... When I see
[SPEAKER_03]: these videos of people doing giant dabs,
I'm like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I just want the tiniest little...
It can never be too small.
Really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and tell us your dab story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also prefer to, on a sash, enjoy a few
more dabs because I want to experience the
[SPEAKER_00]: different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first dab is something I don't do with
first timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have a mission when on events in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to give people their first dab
because I would love to give them a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful experience so that they advocate
for it and that they don't fear high
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and passing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will come to this right now,
but I think this is the better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became older and I like that the people
say to others, oh, this was nice and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was not overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first dab from a different person in
Berlin, I said, I want a Big Mac,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I got a Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the same experience like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I had a board nailed on my
face and I had to walk through whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin to the place where I was staying
and I said to myself, okay, that was crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: and nothing I need in my daily life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big dabs can be funny, but yeah,
the right occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said till today, it's in my mind,
but what happened also when I met this
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, I got in Berlin in touch with new
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me some cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Buddha blue cheese, goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, what a genetic and I brought him some
cuts and this was the first time starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to live culture, not just in the internet,
really to meet people that they trusted
[SPEAKER_00]: you to let you come home to share genetics
and from there everything evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012 also Instagram became bigger and
bigger and now something's changed in my
[SPEAKER_00]: life because you asked at the beginning
for my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012, 2013 Instagram became also in
Germany so important for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and it's a pity that we have so
many problems with this network because I
[SPEAKER_00]: started to network with the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: My alias was German Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have this account and this is
really my private grower account and what
[SPEAKER_00]: I did with this account was to honor the
people who gave me all the knowledge on
[SPEAKER_00]: the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just transferred the knowledge to social
media really early 2012, 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a really important period of
my time because just by keeping the cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: alive of all I learned to share with other
people on social media, I built my network
[SPEAKER_00]: and I also got into a position where I was
one, not the biggest, but one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram accounts in Germany who have
been knowing for educating others and
[SPEAKER_00]: showing them how to extract, how to wash,
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the, how you say that in
English, the base for what I'm doing today
[SPEAKER_00]: to educate and to make my living also
legally since nearly six years,
[SPEAKER_00]: long time before legalization,
decriminalization, to bring food on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table for my family with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure I was growing also and I have
also my back stories in the black market
[SPEAKER_00]: and I remember also 2013 I got,
how you call it when, yeah, I got robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so and I, there was nothing I could
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was and I knew that the money also
have been spent and I had to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: decision, do you want satisfaction or do
you want to continue life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Satisfaction would to break some bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was selling, but it was to bring
good weed to the people and I never saw
[SPEAKER_00]: myself as a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the cannabis industry,
we know exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw myself more as a caregiver making
money, but if there come this criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff into it, I was immediately out and I
told myself, fuck, so much money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there must be a way to earn this
legally with cannabis one day,
[SPEAKER_00]: not in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thought kept going and going in
my head and 2014-15 it started that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana in Germany became a
bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the first patients got, from 2009 it
started, but in my awareness, it started
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012-13 that I saw more patients popping
up, but really fighting hard in front of a
[SPEAKER_00]: court to get the right to get from the
Netherlands, Bedrokan, really shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one case where you have to,
this is such a funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a patient and he got busted
with weed and he said, I claim this as my
[SPEAKER_00]: right as a patient because the German
healthcare system doesn't provide cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's how you say that if I don't get
my medicine, it's like unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like hurting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if before, I don't know, there my
English is not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called it his right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got a case in front of the
court and the judge said something which
[SPEAKER_00]: was written in the article which made me
click.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, okay, I have to give you as one of
the first patients in Germany the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your own because in this room,
there is no other expert knowing more
[SPEAKER_00]: about this plant than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when they busted him, they found
his grower diary with everything written
[SPEAKER_00]: down, which crop, which plant,
how many days, how much amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the judge said, I have to admit that
in this room, there is no other expert
[SPEAKER_00]: than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have and you are really, really ill
and sick and you need this as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the German healthcare system isn't
capable of providing you that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I give you some rules and they will
make it impossible for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, yeah, he said you are allowed to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the expert, but you have to have a
half meter thick concrete walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a safety class five door,
like a five door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the judge immediately made it
impossible, but he gave him the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, this story said to me,
if you show people, also if you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal, that you have been growing wheat
and you love this plant and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: educate about them, when it becomes legal,
you have some like a record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I intensified my work on
social media because I told my self one
[SPEAKER_00]: day, people will ask where you know all
this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can say, ah, yeah,
I have been on the internet and sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: the law for the plant since years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I am Vincent wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: I became patient and it was the cruel,
the, the, the, not the cruise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the hardest decision of my
life's 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to, to go for the papers to
become a legal cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017, the law changed and it w it became
much easier to become a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, not easy, easy air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, okay, with my doctor,
we will take the approach with the new
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife told me, I know I still was
growing and I became patient and the wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: was shitty from the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't consume this wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was still growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 2018, there was a company,
she, the company was called sense media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first German media house for cannabis
content with a magazine, with YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channels, with events, no legalization,
but the investors gambled and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we build up a media company,
and we will legalize one day, then we have
[SPEAKER_00]: all the assets we need to promote our
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the goal of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came to me and they asked me
because there will have been some role
[SPEAKER_00]: models in the German and also
international YouTube space, which have
[SPEAKER_00]: been teaching me to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found out that I have this
Instagram about teaching the German
[SPEAKER_00]: community about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they asked me, do you want to show
your face on one of a YouTube channel we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to build up with you and educate the
Germans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to take the decision to stop
growing my wheat because my wife told me
[SPEAKER_00]: when you show face, no plants in our
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go this path, you have to
go with the medicine of also if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty from the pharmacy, and then you can
live your dream and earn money legally
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, okay, I've, I slept a few
nights and I said, okay, I will stop
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for a certain period of time,
some years, become a patient with,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I also became, this is something
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in front of the court to get the
right that my health insurance company
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pay for my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to get this status in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the status.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was like three or seven
people in the U S that get like weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they get joints every month from
the university of Kentucky or something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those joints, man, it is the hay weed,
you know, like Bedrucon you told before,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, there is one patient that
comes, they lives in Germany, but he comes
[SPEAKER_01]: a year after he comes in July,
August holidays back to Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I met him and this guy has Bedrucon
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it was like, I opened the,
the, the box and it was smelling like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, all of the strains have the smell,
taste, no, they're absolutely kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like brownish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I had to smoke radiated weed the
first two, two and a half years,
[SPEAKER_00]: three years of being a patient and not
growing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the start where seven years
ago I showed face and I have to say how it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been people walking the path on
legalized movement and being real
[SPEAKER_00]: activists long, long, long before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a regular dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, at the beginning,
who through his passion became into a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where he could live,
start to live a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never thought he will have to show face
for cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that, I also took the responsibility
with the, the growing reach I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never will say I'm a activist,
but I support every German activist with
[SPEAKER_00]: my reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure, I, I took the responsibility
and I started to, to make YouTube videos
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing and also using my reach to
tell the people to go to demonstrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took also the, um, that I went also
to the demonstrations because there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of, I call them influencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call me an educator, but go to this
demonstration, but you don't see them
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I told you how I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't tell the people what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I try to pull them with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was showing face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the demos and the
demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I told them, go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been also with them there so
that I could claim the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where have you been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I never would say I'm an activist,
but I take the responsibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also comes with the reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm more an educator and show the
people my path with growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure, also showing face for the
legalized movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a part of the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, now I'm making six years,
seven years YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the company which hired me went
bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't pay my salary from a half year
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have to imagine I went home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told my wife, I don't have a job
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story is a little bit longer,
but I make it in this case, a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter, was completely depressed because
you have to imagine there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization at the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I had my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis market legally earning
food for my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to quit by myself the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few weeks later, they got
bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told my wife, do you know something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I will make it by my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she told me, are you fucking crazy
that if this big company doesn't get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it profitable, how do you want to
make it profitable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her, I studied economics and I
have a plan and I know exactly how it will
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I started a new channel and I
had to find a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first channel is called Growers Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company didn't want it to sell it to
me during this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I have it now as a backup,
but I had to find a name and I was sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: with my wife in the kitchen and
brainstorming a few days, let it sit and
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had some weed on my hoodie and
my wife took it away and she said,
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere where you are, there is weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, Vince and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, yeah, that's your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, then I started my YouTube
channel, which I have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never thought that I will grow that
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my community and they make that
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to work for it for my dream,
but they make it possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They watch my videos and well,
since you have, since you have great
[SPEAKER_03]: humility, I want to give you a compliment
that, you know, that you'll never say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I mention earlier in the show who it
was that recommended that we reach out to
[SPEAKER_03]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you said it to me privately and it
was Goosebumps moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when Jorge Cervantes says, yeah,
you got to speak to Vincent Weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means you must be doing something
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of my teachers without knowing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the, I told him, I had a phone
call one hour with him for a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Jorge, muchas gracias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for teaching me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just released our episode with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encourage everybody to go back to
this video where it said, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, I want this video to be a place
where people thank Jorge, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, because he has inspired us all.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, the first book I owned was his book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I bought two at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was his book and then the Closet
Cultivator by Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the two books that were
available at the bookstore that I went to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so during our time, there have
been books giving around copied.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those people owe Jorge Cervantes 20
bucks and they should mail it to PO Box.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also told a funny story that people
would steal his book because they were
[SPEAKER_03]: scared to buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same on my side.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were scared to go to the cash
register to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first three years of indoor growing,
I never put one step into a grow hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: store because I was so paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police is standing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are filming everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will come to my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I bought was from Home Depot
and we have like, I don't know the word
[SPEAKER_00]: where you buy all the building materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really Home Depot and giving
money to a friend who isn't growing to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: the only piece I couldn't buy,
which was the, the active carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So similar to your story, um, I was a
grower and I was offered a job at a hydro
[SPEAKER_03]: shop at a grow shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plan was to work there for a year
so I could establish some credit,
[SPEAKER_03]: buy a home, and then quit and go back to
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when I was growing, I couldn't get a
loan to buy a house, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when I started working there,
I realized how much I love talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and teaching people about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I didn't tell you was when I
took the job at the grow shop,
[SPEAKER_03]: I shut down my garden as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for many years, eventually I
started up again, but, um, for many years
[SPEAKER_03]: I stopped growing because it was just,
I was out there right in front of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, I felt that it was too risky
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: To grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also was working before I had this
job as a content creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, this is why I made this story
shorter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, it's really, it's really
the, the student starting to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a few years of experience,
getting home to my hometown to finish my
[SPEAKER_00]: study with the final paper I had to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during this time I was working
watching, looking for a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I got my first, they,
they, I was the, then I went into the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro store and I bought stuff there and
they knew me and I gave them weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that in Berlin?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, in Braunschweig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's one there too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I asked, Hey, when you have a
job, please call me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it came that one had to leave and
the spot was free and behind the counter
[SPEAKER_00]: selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I immediately took this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it I was nearly two years in this
hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the base after reading and
growing by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to build setups for the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came back and told me, what the fuck
you have been selling me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rubbish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they came back and said, here's the
same amount of budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the same stuff again, because so,
and the, the good thing is that I had each
[SPEAKER_00]: product in my hand from the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: This market, each fan, each filter,
each fertilizer went through my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I asked my boss, he gave me the
opportunity to test everything I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: because he knew when I know something,
I can sell it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this two years selling and getting
feedback from the growers, which products
[SPEAKER_00]: are good or bad or don't work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, I, I, like I said,
I studied economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into the, into the management of a
shop, grow shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the deal that after a few years,
I own 50% with milestones, which give me
[SPEAKER_00]: with, would pay out 5% of the company,
5% so that I reach 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted me because I had the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought that I will make YouTube,
but I told him, I can, and I am good on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I make a YouTube channel for our
shop, we can upsell even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2017.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he absorbed all my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down, um, like plans, how to
educate the sellers, which products to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell to a beginner, to advanced or to a
pro with different strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And six days before the contract would
start to work that he can't move back,
[SPEAKER_00]: he fired me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the way, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the time that my life,
my steps I had to do to become where I am
[SPEAKER_00]: today was all the time kicking me in my
stomach and testing me if I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work legally with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said all the time, yeah,
I will find my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, coming, this was also something
I came home to my wife and she said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in six days is five days
is Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lost your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lost your, your, um, shares of this
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kicked you right before everything
would unredoable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kicked you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next time was when I lost my
job because the company get bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had many times where I get a huge
setback and had to explain my whole family
[SPEAKER_00]: in a, in a non existing legalization on
the horizons that I still will work in
[SPEAKER_00]: this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was driven by passion and never by
money.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, then I said, okay, let's start a
YouTube channel by my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I convinced her and now I said,
okay, how can I start that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are, um, in the German system,
if you have been working, you get money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you call that in the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unemployment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and when you are in the system,
they also have programs where they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are a way you can write a business
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they see a potential,
they don't force you to find a new job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a half year support that you
can start this job because then they get
[SPEAKER_00]: you out of the system of the unemployment
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote a business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want, I make it long story short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to become a content creator for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen in my old company that we can
make this amount of money with that many
[SPEAKER_00]: output of videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, uh, I can, uh, earn that much
amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the woman I presented the business
plan, she was completely, um, she didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to work with it because the
business plan was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I studied economics, but the topic was
completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, okay, we have to change
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you, you, you, you cross out all the
word cannabis and you don't talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: market and I will get this somehow done
for you approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm so thankful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a supportive 1,500 euros for six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could focus on building the YouTube
channel five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support from the German government to
build a cannabis business long before
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's such a great story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could like be a fly on the wall
looking at that lady when she's reading
[SPEAKER_03]: your, um, proposal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing it makes me a little
sad that they made you take out the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, but, but I'm glad that you got
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even man, not even seats were allowed
at that time, you know, in car,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in Europe or to speak was
allowed to speak was allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to speak, he wasn't doing anything
illegal by talking about it, by being an
[SPEAKER_03]: advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there is something, there is something
as a YouTuber, since the first six and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half years, now we have the
decriminalization I had to, to be so
[SPEAKER_00]: careful what I said and how I,
I explained you how I made my content and
[SPEAKER_00]: what wasn't allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't allowed to say you have to take
the plant and cut it and place it and dunk
[SPEAKER_00]: it and put in and wait, because then I was
giving a straight advice to the viewer of
[SPEAKER_00]: the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had really to be strict with if you take
a cutting, the process, no, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process of taking a cutting is to take
a mother plant, to cut it like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: to dip it, to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to put a disclaimer and really
my, my team behind me at the first YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, they teach me to be really,
really careful with my wording because the
[SPEAKER_00]: government could watch my video and say,
okay, he is giving advice to be
[SPEAKER_00]: conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not conspiracy laws,
whether in the U S or in other countries
[SPEAKER_03]: are just crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when, when you're not actually,
you know, because conspiracy means like
[SPEAKER_03]: we're working together to do something
bad, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're not conspiring with people that
you never actually met or talked to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you were, you were educating,
but yeah, I was helping for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, but you know, it was the same
thing here again in the grow shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't allowed to talk about wheat,
you know, they would always say that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was a tomato or I shouldn't, you know,
that changed when I, when I had my grow
[SPEAKER_03]: stop shop, eventually things changed
because, um, medical marijuana became
[SPEAKER_03]: legal and, and so we became much more open
about talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I used to go to a grow shop,
the mere mention of cannabis would get you
[SPEAKER_03]: thrown out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was throwing out, out people as an
employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, each time we had like this
discussions in the team, when somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: came in and he was like really penetrant
with asking this question, then we fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he, is he a cop?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, it was considered
illegal to sell something to someone that
[SPEAKER_03]: you knew was, was going to do something
illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I guess the same thing still
applies.
[SPEAKER_03]: For other things, like if you go to a drug
store and you know, you're buying,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Sudafed every day, then they
might stop you because they think that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're making drugs or, or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you know, when you tell your
stories and I had the same situation with
[SPEAKER_03]: Sasha, they're so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have similar stories and I
won't tell them now about how partners
[SPEAKER_03]: were giving me equity and then ripped me
off and, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just amazing to me that,
you know, six, 7,000 miles away,
[SPEAKER_03]: however far you, you guys are,
the stories are all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it happens at a different time,
but you know, the similarities are
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you, are your videos still online?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those early videos of you teaching people
how to make clones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I encourage anyone that speaks
German to check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to check it out without
speaking German, but yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the beautiful thing to come into
the presence is that I, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I stopped growing my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, my system was re my system was crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your hands on for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never let the contact to the plant or Q
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still was doing, which was risky,
but not that risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still was making consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into the gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in out, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you talked about when you become a
medical patient that you had to start
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking really bad weed, but you didn't
have friends that could hook you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you the, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like, this was my status and I,
I had to buy the weed at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: 1200, 1500 euros a month, the gram price
by 22, 25 grams, shitty dead weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for sure friends of mine and also
through the consulting, I got my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my good quality top shelf weed,
but I couldn't rely on it and I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: buy it because I had to spend it to get my
card and to show that I buy my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to show that I buy it every month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't buy enough, they would say
you don't need as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, then they would say,
ah, okay, you got the, the recipe for your
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and now you are buying it or
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was why I went to the court and
said, also, I am a patient with ADHD and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to pay my, my medical amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but in the time where it was,
I was working in the grocery shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to know my, I said, I was finishing
my papers for study, my last paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was here in my hometown where my
family is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to know my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were dating and I went a lot of times
to other cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the moment I went to the train
station in my city, cell phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: battery out, SIM card out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I placed it into a Faradalic cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was called that Stalin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went for two, three days into
some grow operations where I helped the
[SPEAKER_00]: people really to dial in in crops,
not crops during this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not the term, which, but
training, maximizing yields, building up
[SPEAKER_00]: SOPs in the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been in the, in the, in the grow
ops three days, just ordering pizza,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't, don't leaving the house and
completely shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met my wife and we were dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, okay, I, I have to go to
a job and I have to, I'm not reachable for
[SPEAKER_00]: three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she asked me what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her what I'm doing because I
trusted her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to one consulting and the
next one, and she, she was the first why a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl during this time I was dating with a
lot of girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't questioning what I do three
days without being reachable on my phone
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came home and after a few jobs,
I asked myself, I, I asked her,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you, I, I feel that you don't have
this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: She never gave me this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This feeling yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I said, I have to marry you
because she was totally down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she, and I, I, I don't have till today
in this case is I never had headache when
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, when I told her I'm three days
away, she never asked if I'm doing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with other girls during this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she never gave me this feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to ask her if she will become my
Bonnie and Clyde.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really glad that you shared that
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, you know, because you know
why, because you are doing it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: heart, you know, it's a hard thing for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you're so determined to do it
all the time from the, from all the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, like all of us are actually,
we have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us, you know, we are infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, we are, we have this virus,
the economy's virus inside of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like cannot stop that,
you know, like just leave it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vincent, I would be really interested in
how you can tell us a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_01]: transition, you know, from the time that
illegality, the total illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all the world is thinking like
it's legalized, but I know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain a little bit from your
perspective, what is going on in Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is exactly where I wanted to
continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, and now you know how I met my
wife also through cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely taking the decision to marry
this woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was making YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you, I stopped growing for showing
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the first of April this year,
no, last year, we got a decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fucking hard battle and it's far
away from being a perfect law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really complicated law and with a
lot of nonsense, but we have our foot into
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I'm growing again, just three
plants, just three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to imagine I'm glad and happy,
but not satisfied because I can't hold
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't build up a library at the moment
with, I can't go on a, on a, on a hunt for
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, for phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me as a private person, can I ask
about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they consider a plant having roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had some, uh, this is now the
reason I was going to ask, can you have
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you grow mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the best argument because,
okay, we go, we dive somewhere into the
[SPEAKER_00]: law in the law is written that if that a
cannabis plant is a fee is a female plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with, um, with flowers, or at least with
the beginning of flower, with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the sex, yeah, with the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is the term family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, parts of the plan to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fought and we hoped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this law isn't perfect and a lot
of things will be, um, terminated in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of court.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the, the judges are now saying
that each plant with roots in soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even we have the problems that even
the Jiffy's, the easy plaques or the rock
[SPEAKER_00]: wall that when it comes to the case that
they come to your home and they find 25
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and you have cuttings, the judge at
the moment will bring it and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a plant, even if the law it's written
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a situation really.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I'm teaching the people on the
teaching, but telling them we are not
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to fight for a real
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your new life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do freedom, but don't get cozy on your
fucking sofa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to go on the fucking street to,
to fight for a real, for me legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is like, I'm not allowed to have
more than three kilos at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's okay for me, but it's not the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 50 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not able to grow free plants,
which are allowed to the maximum and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I keep all the flowers at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the street is very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one tiny plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have here a little bit hanging and it's
nearly the half.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I mean, 50 grams, you know,
for instance, if it takes two months to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're only allowed to have 50 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not allowed to have more than a
gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is exactly the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law says that, um, 50 grams of dried
consumable flower, but the, I keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty words away, but when they,
if they come and they bust you,
[SPEAKER_00]: which still occurs and you are just a real
good citizen paying taxes and growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: your own and don't bringing more than 25
G's on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are even not allowed to share a joint
with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not allowed to share wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not legal in Germany.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to spread it to the world,
but we have our foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, everything starts somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, I mean, it's still,
it's still a great, it's really late.
[SPEAKER_03]: This should have happened a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this still is a really great first
step.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, and then, you know,
as we taught, you know, the government
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that this should be allowed,
then eventually it'll be more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then before you know it,
there will be, you know, cannabis shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, on, on every street,
like there is in big cities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is we, as humans are impatient
and from a, a economical perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: a four to five year rhythm in politician,
in politics or in economics, it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: like one year of a human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is that I learned because
now I'm so long time observing the process
[SPEAKER_00]: and now we have new elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to say is that I know that
now we can show the people that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: become zombies smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will occur a higher acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the highest when they make polls,
who wants to legalize, who don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize anymore or further step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the highest acceptance 52%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the highest acceptance of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I throwing you off?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, we have the highest acceptance of
legalizations than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This law and it would take a whole own
podcast to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the whole law and to explain
everything with home growing, with project
[SPEAKER_00]: test projects, with kind of social clubs,
with the new elections being in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: us right now and people being feared that
this law will be how you call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, repealed, crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people, four and a half to 6
million people as consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be relieved that they are not criminal
anymore and they have to fear to become
[SPEAKER_00]: criminals again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but I don't see that really,
but I can't deny that I am also in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of fear because the whole world
is going crazy and we getting from a
[SPEAKER_00]: democracy to a, in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk about that,
but also Europe, the shift to the extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the conservative party, which is not
the extreme right, they alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to, to really, to, to undo this
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something they claim also,
but they don't will have a coalition
[SPEAKER_00]: partner because all the other parties who
legalized, let's call them legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the only options in certain
different combination to build a,
[SPEAKER_00]: to build, um, a government, but there is
the huge amount of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the right party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if the conservative said they
don't will work with them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, also similar stuff has
happened here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, um, it's like the ebb and
flow of the tide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things get better and then they get worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was counties in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they legalized it to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all these people set up their
grows and then the, then the county
[SPEAKER_03]: changed their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the chair didn't want it to
fulfill the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, like I said, the, the
similarities are palpable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you said you wanted to tell the
good side of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can grow three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of people are not criminals
anymore who never have been criminals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who have been just consumers and lovers of
the plant and took the decision to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis instead of other things after
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty, the beauty is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you see now the culture, the cannabis
culture in Germany, which have been there
[SPEAKER_00]: all decades and was living under the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the moment from the 1st of April,
where the new law decriminalized cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw so many small sashes popping up in
all parts of Germany, for sure in the
[SPEAKER_00]: South, a little bit less where the
Bavarians are, but the people lost the
[SPEAKER_00]: fear to say, yes, I'm consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that they're the big events.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have been pulled up really grassroot
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I found, I found a location.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tables come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's meet really, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low entry barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the people were asking in the
community, I live in this city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know where it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something around and no fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to travel three hours, but I want
to meet people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I don't know one person,
but other goes to a bar and start to drink
[SPEAKER_00]: and to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can I meet some people who smoke
cannabis and start to talk with them about
[SPEAKER_00]: turps, about how I roll my joint,
how I extract, how I water wash,
[SPEAKER_00]: how I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The culture is alive and it's just the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this is what it's so beautiful to
watch everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis events, small events,
but doesn't matter if 20 people meet or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: people meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a seed germinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a seed that's beginning to grow and
it's going to get bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the push of also the content I could
do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show washing hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if YouTube tries to fuck me up and
to age restrict the content, I could wash
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and inspire people to wash hash on
the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a student, but to the, the beauty is
that I am in touch with all the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: artists internationally and with every
German hash artist artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could ask and spend time with them
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, from the forums to social
media, from me having the possibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: be side by side with people washing on the
highest level, transferring this knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: to the whole community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you in the last weeks and
months, the level of hash home growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: From dirty sand to white stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now drying without freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really the air drying movement at
the moment because the people can't afford
[SPEAKER_00]: a freeze dryer, but they want higher
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go the painful way of,
of simulating sublimation in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer and sifting the hash and drying it
with wake a vacuum and putting it back in
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community is building and sharing SOPs
how to wash with, with the possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the affordable tools, how to dry and
how to press clear white rosin without
[SPEAKER_00]: being a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, this is what I'm standing up
every day to push our movement,
[SPEAKER_00]: to push our community, to push the regular
home grower to the next level,
[SPEAKER_00]: to inspire the people what's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's going on in Germany at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so beautiful to be part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you letting us be a little
part of it through you and to experience
[SPEAKER_03]: that excitement through you, particularly
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're closer to Sasha that,
you know, than me, but it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: thing to watch this grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I appreciate you sharing that
enthusiasm with us and we feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and you know, like I said before,
and I don't want to make you blush too
[SPEAKER_03]: much because I see that that happens is
you're apparently doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not that you just that,
that you want to teach people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are, you know, to the point that,
you know, the great teachers of the world
[SPEAKER_03]: are saying Vince is out there teaching
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I feel really lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel really lucky that you were able to
join us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we can do it again real soon
because I do want to get more specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: About, you know, what's going on in
Germany right now with the legalities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we got your whole story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should definitely have you come
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk about genetics,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's, let's, let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hop on on the next episode or one of
the next and start, which I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole legalization law giving process
has been two years sweating, hardworking,
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and then the relief moment and the
culture booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure we also can then when we talk
about the, the German culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: also talk about a little bit more
genetics, but I would love to have a deep
[SPEAKER_00]: dive with you about the last 30 months of
German cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's been a tremendous, it's been a
lot of fun, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, one thing that I,
that I do want to add is that one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: great blessings of doing this show is that
I've been making friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that this is the beginning of
a, of a friendship between us,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I can tell, like Sasha would say
is we're brothers, you know, and like we
[SPEAKER_03]: have such same similar experiences that I
definitely hope that we stay in touch
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could stay here with you two more
hours without thinking because really you
[SPEAKER_03]: need, you need to get to feed yourself and
take care of your wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, we'll schedule this again
for real soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
