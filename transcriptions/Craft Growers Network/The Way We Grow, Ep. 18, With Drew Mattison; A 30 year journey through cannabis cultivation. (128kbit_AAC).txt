[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the way we grow podcast a production of
[SPEAKER_00]: the craft growers network Today our guest
is drew Madison now drew was suggested for
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast by our last guest Jarrett
Richie and You know, he was Introduced to
[SPEAKER_00]: me as Jarrett's teacher when Jarrett and
entered the cannabis space and sort of his
[SPEAKER_00]: sensei and the the grow guru that he got
all of his information from and So after
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing that introduction and enjoying my
conversation with Jarrett so much I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had to get drew on the show so drew
welcome and Tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis journey and you know where
it all sort of started for you Thanks,
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jared's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've known each other for a couple
decades now Met in Denver long time ago
[SPEAKER_02]: through a mutual friend in the restaurant
business I think a lot of us in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry have had some time in the
restaurant business at one time or another
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to its flexibility and such but yeah,
I I grew up in Florida originally East
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast and where the laws and the Mindset
on cannabis is very different than then in
[SPEAKER_02]: the West where I ended up meeting Jared
and so forth and really beginning my
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis career but you know started in
Florida growing up and then I went to
[SPEAKER_02]: college at University of South Florida and
I graduated there and I couldn't get out
[SPEAKER_02]: of Florida quick enough and so back in
1993 I bolted to Denver met a friend who
[SPEAKER_02]: had escaped Florida a couple of years
earlier and And just hit the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: running absolutely fell in love with
Colorado the people Were probably my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite part even though you know the
mountains and the snow and the
[SPEAKER_02]: snowboarding I grew up surfing So
snowboarding was a natural segue But I
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely fell in love with Colorado and
but as I was saying the people and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset of just the kind of live and let
live kind of mentality really struck me
[SPEAKER_02]: and I took a liking to right away and And
about a year after I moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend my roommate Had a friend
visit him from University of Florida and
[SPEAKER_02]: down in Florida University There were two
hot spots for cannabis back in the day
[SPEAKER_02]: long time ago Really when kind bud when
that name really didn't even exist in
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called creepy back in the day That
was the name and it was it came from Miami
[SPEAKER_02]: and it quickly came and went to
Gainesville, Florida, which is where the
[SPEAKER_02]: University of Florida is the Gators and
those two places seem to be the epicenter
[SPEAKER_02]: of high-grade quality homegrown cannabis
in Florida for quite a while and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: lucky enough as I said When I moved to
Colorado to have a friend come out from UF
[SPEAKER_02]: who had a little bit of cannabis
Cultivation experience and he had some
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing genetics for back then It was it
was very hard to come come about or come
[SPEAKER_02]: by kind bud creepy Just really good dank
seedless You know sense of media back then
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is one of the few cats one of you
guys that had it and I was very impressed
[SPEAKER_02]: by what he had and and I was I was
intrigued and I asked I picked his brain
[SPEAKER_02]: and Unfortunately, he was and I'm sure a
lot of people have experienced this in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry is that some people are very
forthcoming with information and some
[SPEAKER_02]: people hold it tight to their chest and I
don't know if it's pride or ego or just
[SPEAKER_02]: their own hard work and they don't want to
give it away and that's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: understandable and He was one of those
that kept it close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I began my cannabis journey kind of
figuring things out of my own and learning
[SPEAKER_02]: the hard way Making many many many many
many mistakes As a matter of fact almost
[SPEAKER_02]: all the things I have taught people over
the years have been because of I've
[SPEAKER_02]: screwed them up Learn the hard way and
we'll never forget those lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes those are the best things and
so Yeah, so I started growing in Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: in about 1994 Just about a year after
moving out there and it all began in a
[SPEAKER_02]: little closet and a apartment complex off
of 6th Avenue West right by a Red Rocks
[SPEAKER_02]: amphitheater, which is where I lived For a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all started there in a little
apartment with a 400 watt metal halide a
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydro farm ebb and flow one of those
orange plastic ones They used to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time ago all a kid ready to go right
in the box You just take it out of the box
[SPEAKER_02]: get it set up and and we had some seeds
from a couple of you know bags that we got
[SPEAKER_02]: on the black market, of course everything
was black market back in the mid 90s and I
[SPEAKER_02]: just had a couple of seeds that we were
lucky enough to find and popped them and
[SPEAKER_02]: they they germinated and got a few ounces
of incredibly good Incredibly good
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis my first time around I was quite
lucky but so it started there and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I didn't and I went from One project
to the next all personal projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really get into commercial
growing for maybe about five years after
[SPEAKER_02]: that just I've been a connoisseur and And
so it's just been more of a personal
[SPEAKER_02]: project taking care of my own health I do
have chronic back issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's been a very good thing for
me to get into it producing it for myself
[SPEAKER_02]: so that I can take care of my back and
help me sleep a little better because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that's my main thing is I don't
sleep very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis helps me significantly in
night, especially the heavier indica
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant strains high high mercy Turpene
strains help me significantly when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I got my start in Colorado
in the mid 90s and then graduated from
[SPEAKER_02]: place to place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rent a house talk with the landlord
examine the basement the
[SPEAKER_02]: basement was my thing for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like basements were the thing for a
lot of people for quite a while because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I always see the old pictures of
people trying to do it in their attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a place like Colorado
that becomes a problem in the winter when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the only house on the block without
snow on the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, I've seen like a lot of
people kind of trend towards the basements
[SPEAKER_00]: in that time and especially in colder
areas, you know, you have a more Your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures can won't fluctuate as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a little bit better control
especially considering the different
[SPEAKER_00]: controls you had access to in the 90s are
far different than what we have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: today and you know, you were having to
MacGyver a lot of things to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: it worked properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of those first experiences?
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of those first experiences
like when you were growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's interesting you bring
up the the climate issue and that that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one of the biggest things we deal
with and that's why we're so blessed for
[SPEAKER_02]: the growers luckily enough lucky enough to
grow in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some very nice weather and it's
very conducive of growing and cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in a in a grow your your
parameters are very important humidity and
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature being to the most important
and Colorado were blessed with incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: low humidity and you know plants do you
know with vapor pressure etcetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do enjoy a certain amount of humidity
for maximum growth etcetera etcetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, very quickly can you go too far
and create too much humidity and all of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sudden you're dealing with major issues
mold bud rot all sorts of other issues
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have to you know, whether it's
spring to mitigate and it's just opens up
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole can of worms and so Colorado is a
beautiful place to grow because of that
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of humidity squashes that potential
for the mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, things can still grow and
fester, but it's just a great head start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have in Colorado also the just the
climate being cool almost every night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't I my first probably my first 15
years of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't use air conditioning once I
didn't need air conditioning one time I I
[SPEAKER_02]: I specialized in growing up in the
mountains up in the foothills evergreen
[SPEAKER_02]: was it was an area that I I enjoy growing
very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have about a elevation of 7
to 8000 feet above sea level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we every night of the year even when
it's 95 degrees even 100 degrees in
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver, it'll be 68 degrees at night in
evergreen even Denver will be in the low
[SPEAKER_02]: 70's on a very very hot day and when
you're pumping dry air at 72 degrees into
[SPEAKER_02]: a grow that's that's even you know,
and that's the warmest it gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's summer months at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's very conducive of healthy
healthy plant vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was very lucky to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you running your plants the lights at
night then so that you could kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: offset those day temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still something that's super
suggested to a bunch of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's something that I feel like a lot
of people miss that that one key point of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works good in the summer and in the
winter because you have that ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat or cool more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing to consider too is the
electrical that the tiered service of
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical service provided IREA,
Xcel Energy, whomever it happens to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: always charge less money at night for
those less in demand hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's also another benefit of
being able to grow or using your 12 and 12
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle to be on at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's cheaper as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but we have between the temperature and
the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much put that 12 hours on at night
every night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Colorado just did me did me so
right early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I was able to skip the charge
of the air conditioning and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, the costly maintenance and then
the purchases of the air conditioning and
[SPEAKER_02]: installation and all that and getting the
HVAC guy down in your basement and all
[SPEAKER_02]: those things we've had to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, having people in our grows or in
our areas or in our sensitive areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been very, very nice just pumping,
pumping air in, pumping air out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had things on, you know, temp stats and
you know, so the temperature would get at
[SPEAKER_02]: a certain degree, get maybe above,
let's say, 84 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom fan cuts on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some massive, you know,
seven, eight hundred, nine hundred CFM
[SPEAKER_02]: fans pumping air in and pumping air out at
the same time, obviously with carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day when things were on the DL
and underground, I had some ozone in line
[SPEAKER_02]: ozone generators that were also used in
conjunction with the carbon filters that
[SPEAKER_02]: seemed to scrub the air, even,
you know, getting what the carbon filters
[SPEAKER_02]: missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's quite an effective scrubbing
process because of all that air I had to
[SPEAKER_02]: pump out of my house in lieu of the air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's quite effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it sounds like you were already
thinking early on about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental needs of the plants and
making sure that you were also targeting a
[SPEAKER_00]: low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So budget, you were very budget minded,
which I feel like is something that is so
[SPEAKER_00]: important and you can't just look at,
you know, necessarily buying the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment to make everything run as
smoothly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you really need to you need
to look at it as like a cost benefit and
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit analysis and see how much you
actually can spend feasibly and what you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get with that price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, air exchange in a room,
while not necessarily ideal for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of the things that you
mentioned, you were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling for with like the ozone and
the carbon filters for molds and pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were already, you have those in mind
and you have that as part of like your SOP
[SPEAKER_00]: already, which is such an important thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since you were like kind of already
geared towards really tuning in to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you had the capability of achieving,
what were some of those initial harvests
[SPEAKER_00]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you kind of hit the ground running and
start to see success right off the bat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you have a few large failures?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you kind of mentioned earlier that
you learn from failures as we all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what were some of those early on
successes and some of those early on
[SPEAKER_00]: failures that taught you some lessons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, luckily, I hit the ground running
with a successful little three ounce or so
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest with my first harvest in the
closet in the one apartment complex where
[SPEAKER_02]: I started on my adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so pleased and so amazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I grew up gardening,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew up in in the southeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said in Florida, I was also in
Atlanta for a handful of years,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is where my father stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go visit him and he always had a
wicked garden in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always, you know, helping him pick,
helping him plant, helping him weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: all those good things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love just, you know, just like and I
wouldn't see it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every three, four days, I'd go out in
the garden and like, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_02]: that pepper is twice the size as it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just blew me away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just nature blew me away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So extending this over into the cannabis
realm was just a natural geeky thing for
[SPEAKER_02]: me to do and just enjoy watching it grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis explodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just every day you see a difference with
cannabis and how it how it's affected by
[SPEAKER_02]: your stimuli, the environment that you
create.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so some of the so I was quite
successful at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had, as I said, because I didn't read it
in a book, we didn't have the freaking
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't able to just, you know,
press a key and see how somebody else is
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it down the road or on the other
side of the country or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, my cloning, for
instance, my first cloning and I for my
[SPEAKER_02]: first foray was with seeds, as I said,
and they popped and germinated and they
[SPEAKER_02]: worked quite well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got rid of the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: The females worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the three ounces from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But soon thereafter, I tried some cloning
and I didn't have any direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was I took clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took leaves as clones like I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took, you know, did the 45 degree angle,
dipped it into the solution and they
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't root because they were leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I I just didn't know anything back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the leaves failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I tried bigger pieces and that
happened to have branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hey, those worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just figured that out on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, back then I'm using
some cheap powderized hormone that you got
[SPEAKER_02]: from the garden store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have clone X.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have, you know, grow tack or
any of these better brands of gels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so quite a bit of failure back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the cloning thing started working,
I had some more and more success.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I would my one of my first
grows was in Evergreen, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets cold at night, as you alluded
to earlier in your comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even in the garage, I was growing in a
garage above.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a kind of like a mother in law suite
of a big master house up the driveway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was in this guest house and
there's a garage on the bottom and the and
[SPEAKER_02]: the habitation up above.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm growing downstairs and it's not
insulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to get, you know, and I didn't
realize the space here thing and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: minimum temperature could be without
screwing up the plants and what that would
[SPEAKER_02]: even look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do you even recognize if
you're screwing up the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're too cold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I learned quickly that they will
continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's and let's say they're in the,
you know, clearly in the 30s are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: wilt and die.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say they're in the low 40s or
mid 40s or higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to still grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to still look very green and
lush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's going to happen is that the
inner nodal space is going to stay large.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to fill in the gaps on
the colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your little nodes are going to be
spread out like they are at the very
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of growth, maybe around the
third, fourth week when they start to
[SPEAKER_02]: really flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they do is they just don't end up
filling in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't end up getting colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have these beautiful plants with
hella crystals, hella trichomes everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: because the cold actually brings out the
trichomes as we know, the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have these little nugs everywhere
and they don't add up and they don't look
[SPEAKER_02]: that great and they end up being covered
in triches, but just little popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had multiple sessions with
temperatures too cold, not realizing that
[SPEAKER_02]: until I figured that out and bringing the
temperature up.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, I like the temperatures not
to get down below 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the low 60s, maybe 63.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that really frosty look going,
but not hurt the plant and not ruin that
[SPEAKER_02]: potential of those big fat colas growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to keep my temperatures between
about 63, 64 at the very, very coldest and
[SPEAKER_02]: right around maybe the mid 80s to low 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people talk about the high 70s and
the very low 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally like the metabolic absorption
of the water of the nutrient in that mid
[SPEAKER_02]: 80s, mid to low 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like higher than 80s because funk
starts forming in the reservoirs,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really do like those low 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like the plants are very vigorous
and they grow quite well in that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the opposite side,
temperature is getting too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, we're growing with
thousand watt metal halide lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hortilux was the cream of the crop bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things have like the most hot
centers ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you see them on a thermal scan,
it's just like molten lava in the center
[SPEAKER_02]: by the bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going out from there,
it's exponentially cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have these crazy hotspots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the trichomes are much less around
the hotspot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hairs, the actual pistols of the
flower, of the buds are much smaller too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are thwarted as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so getting too hot is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started adding fans right under
the lights to push cooler air between the
[SPEAKER_02]: light and the top of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's before air-cooled lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a big deal when air-cooled
lights came in because then we didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to have those fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we figured out the glass was
cutting out some of that energy that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we soon got rid of the air-cooled
lights and moved toward to just heavy air
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioning and so forth in these larger
grows that we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of failure with just temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity has been huge failures as well,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said earlier, plants love a decent
humidity up until a certain point where
[SPEAKER_02]: they start growing mold and then bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't like spraying a bunch of
stuff, even organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather not spray it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best thing to do is just keep those
parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the humidity, in my opinion,
in the low 50s is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you get that vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the maximum absorption of
nutrient, maximum growth without the
[SPEAKER_02]: chance of mold and mildew happening all
over your bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keeping those parameters in check
seems to minimize those problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so temperature and humidity were big
problems with my early grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have such a different nutrient
assimilation rate of assimilation when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're under these high-intensity
discharge lights because they do push off
[SPEAKER_00]: so much heat down right onto the canopy
that adjusting for that heat and the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature can be a little harder
than what growers are experiencing now
[SPEAKER_00]: with LED lights where they actually need
to maintain a much higher temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher humidity for maximum
transpiration rates within the same growth
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces that had maybe a one-to-one fixture
replacement where they had HIDs and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're onto LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom, they have to completely change
their environmental parameters to still
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve the same high-quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were growing all these
different methods, what were some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest innovations that you saw?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mentioned air-cooled ballasts,
which was huge for HID growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that Jarrett mentioned to me
that you owned a grow shop at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you must have encountered numerous
innovations throughout your career in both
[SPEAKER_00]: growing as well as retailing these
different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the ones that you look
back at now with like a really fond memory
[SPEAKER_00]: of being just the most cutting edge thing
that you had seen at that time and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: give me like the top three things that you
witnessed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have to say, you know,
one of the first things I saw,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I saw a lot of different
technologies come out as far as the type
[SPEAKER_02]: of hydroponics because hydroponics is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much of the hydroponic industry is
engineering from the lighting to the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual plumbing and pressurized water
systems, spray systems, aeroponics,
[SPEAKER_02]: aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the most interesting things I
saw early on was I went to, there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: guy named Gordon Creaser and he's a really
popular Australian hydroponic grower that
[SPEAKER_02]: is an innovator from probably almost 50
years ago at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used early hydroponics, but he did
aquaponics with fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to go to his house in Orlando
probably about 30 years ago, right during
[SPEAKER_02]: my first couple of years of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had his whole garage with an
aquarium and an entire self-sustained fish
[SPEAKER_02]: aquaponics set up and it blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, back then I was just doing
top drip with Rockwell and top drip is
[SPEAKER_02]: still my favorite even today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was just getting started and it's
going to this guy's garage and seeing no
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient, no anything, and not even pH,
just the fish keeping everything in a
[SPEAKER_02]: homeostasis situation just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, that was the first thing
that like was revolutionary and different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that's still being done today
aquaponics all across the world for
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing that really blew my mind
was probably the lighting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the LED thing is absolutely
revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going from just the same old, same old for
really a couple of few decades with the
[SPEAKER_02]: HID lighting, whether it was metal halide
for the veg cycle and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: high pressure sodium for the bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to have this LED and essentially
kind of the same LED can be used for veg
[SPEAKER_02]: and bloom, which kind of blew us away as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we do have some specific
spectrums that go back and forth between
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, a lot of people use the
same light for veg and bloom and do quite
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the light, you know, that literally
the half, you know, double the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: lumens, double the amount of par watts
going out with half the amount of energy
[SPEAKER_02]: being consumed and less than half the
amount of heat was absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: revolutionary, especially for home
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, commercial systems are
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get away with mass air
conditioning units, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, it costs money to run,
but you can get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with some home systems, you can't even
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a non-starter for a lot of guys,
whether in the bedroom or a basement or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever or in a closet like where I
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having access to LEDs just opened
the door for so many more people to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to tap in, use their home to be able
to grow, maximize, grow their own
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just better quality product,
you know, less airy bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buds that didn't get the burn,
like I was saying, with those hot spots
[SPEAKER_02]: that were created so often with the HID
lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the quality went up, the cost went
down, and I think more and more people
[SPEAKER_02]: just entered the market and started
growing for themselves because it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to do and less money to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the lighting was a huge,
huge part of it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thirdly, I think these climate control
systems are badass, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember 20 years ago dreaming and
wishing that I had engineer friends that
[SPEAKER_02]: could have developed a Rockwell or a media
sensing hydrometer with a probe that could
[SPEAKER_02]: sense if your Rockwell didn't,
if the pump broke, your Rockwell,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, your plant, because in Rockwell,
you don't have much of a buffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your system goes down 24 hours,
you're going to be dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants are going to be dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you had some sort of sensor,
and of course, we have smartphones now,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have all of this present today,
which is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would have died for this 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get a little message on my
phone saying, hey, I'm sensing 10%
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity in your Rockwell cube,
whereas it should be 20% or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You clearly have a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd race home, fix my pump or my dripper,
got clogged or something, and problem
[SPEAKER_02]: solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you how many times I walked
into a room, and even before looking,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smell rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smell the rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if anything is different,
every time you're walking down the stairs
[SPEAKER_02]: and going into your grow room,
if anything is different from the smell,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sound is different, you know something
is wrong and you're embracing yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the smell of a little rot or
something different, even for 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: I go down, it's like, okay, my plants are
dying because they got too much water,
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't get enough water, something's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these automated systems are just
absolutely amazing today that can let you
[SPEAKER_02]: know on your phone, you can on your app,
you can turn on and exhaust fan,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can turn off an exhaust fan,
you can turn on water, you can adjust pH
[SPEAKER_02]: with these doser systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, these automated systems that
aren't just for these big commercial box
[SPEAKER_02]: places, but for Joe and his basement,
are just really badass and fun to use,
[SPEAKER_02]: fun to dial in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I kind of alluded to earlier,
we're hobbyists, but we're also little
[SPEAKER_02]: engineers ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are not many people that are growing
that don't know how to use their brains
[SPEAKER_02]: and their hands to fix things because
things happen and the grow stores not
[SPEAKER_02]: always open down the road and you need to
make something happen right now at 11 o
[SPEAKER_02]: 'clock at night when you discovered it,
and you need to fix the problem right then
[SPEAKER_02]: and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think every grower has a little bit
of engineering inside them, whether they
[SPEAKER_02]: admit it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that wholeheartedly and there
is so much more peace of mind when you do
[SPEAKER_00]: have the ability to monitor your grow from
a distance, but it's almost a double-edged
[SPEAKER_00]: sword sometime because maybe there was a
little bit of ignorance's bliss at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always sucks walking into a room when
you start to smell that rot smell where
[SPEAKER_00]: you know leaves have wilted and are not
coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just that it's a very obvious
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it and I had a fucking reaction
to that thought because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I fucking smell it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the ability to monitor it,
then when you do see a problem and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the only person that can go and fix
it, you're almost obligated to because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't, then you can't blame anything
else besides yourself or your own lazy
[SPEAKER_00]: ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas before you might have just been
like, well, I check on it twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not within my checks, I don't know
what else to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go out there every 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I do love monitoring though
because it also helps with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: newer technologies or techniques I should
say such as like crop steering,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just new for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people in tomato and cucumber
industries have been using crop steering
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques for decades successfully as
well and being able to produce that much
[SPEAKER_00]: more produce off of each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said that your father was your
start into gardening in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the first plants that
you remember growing that you were really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about that maybe excited your
senses to where you really wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow this path that you've taken with
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said you also went to
university and I was wondering,
[SPEAKER_00]: does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your degree happen to play into your
love with of plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my dad started me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was always a gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually a landscape architect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was worked for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fish and Wildlife Service and he would
design wildlife refuges across the
[SPEAKER_02]: southeast of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wildlife Refuge is like, you know,
100 acre, 200 acre refuges where the
[SPEAKER_02]: visitor center would be where the,
you know, like in a swamp, the Okefenokee
[SPEAKER_02]: Swamp in North Florida, South Georgia
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, you know, designed that whole refuge
and, you know, where everything went,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bathrooms and where the swamp,
you know, would go and the boat launches
[SPEAKER_02]: would be and just everything and with the
plants, he knew every plant, what every
[SPEAKER_02]: plant was, every tree was, he could
identify.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a little bit of that in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, like I said, in Atlanta,
we always had the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, my favorite plants were
tomatoes and beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think because I got the
satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a very patient person and I wasn't
a very patient kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being able to see something every
day grow and change blew me away and it
[SPEAKER_02]: kept me going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it took weeks for things to happen,
it's a little harder for me to stay
[SPEAKER_02]: involved and stay chomping at the bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But watching a tomato grow every day,
coming from a little flower to a little
[SPEAKER_02]: ball of fruit and just grow literally
every day and see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing with a bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beans were really cool to me as a
little kid because they would follow a
[SPEAKER_02]: string up or a pole up and just,
and every day, it's like another six
[SPEAKER_02]: inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh my God, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eating our fruits of our labor,
literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would cook and eat the vegetables in
our garden on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd harvest, then cook them the next
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we'd can and preserve them as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just all of that, all the way from
farm to in my belly was neat seeing that
[SPEAKER_02]: whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then expanding on that in cannabis
later in my life and being able to grow my
[SPEAKER_02]: own medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, I've had a, you know,
it started recreationally with me with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because of just absolutely loving
the plant, loving the effect on me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in college, et cetera,
in late high school, which was pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: where I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it soon happened after I hurt my back
in my mid to late 20s to where cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: was a lifesaver as far as a medicine for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the ability to produce my own
chemical-free organic medicine that I know
[SPEAKER_02]: has zero anything bad on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then consume that cannabis,
both eating it and mostly smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The edibles aren't quite as effective for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very effective for others.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't work quite as well for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So consuming it, smoking it or vaping is
best for me for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But being able to follow that all the way
from where I germinate the seed or take
[SPEAKER_02]: the cutting from a host plant,
growing it, curing it, smoking it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and feeling better from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty neat, it's pretty cathartic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a pretty neat circle of
life right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was a real treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning that as a child through eating
the benefits of our labor to smoking and
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming and having a medicine that is a
benefit of my own labor as well was a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: treat throughout my life.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no wonder that, you know,
farming popped up in multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going on to then, did you kind of
pursue any path in horticulture or botany
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that when you went into
college?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what was your path there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in college, I was, you know,
I was one of those lost kids, frankly,
[SPEAKER_02]: in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my friends knew what they wanted
to be when they grew up, knew where they
[SPEAKER_02]: were heading.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I liked gardening, loved it,
but I wasn't hyper passionate about
[SPEAKER_02]: anything in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been searching most of my life
for that thing to just jump into that just
[SPEAKER_02]: was just a green light and everything
pointed me in that direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, nothing, nothing did that for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up just kind of falling into a few
places and then just very much enjoying
[SPEAKER_02]: and feeling incredibly lucky and blessed
where I fell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in school, I was a liberal arts
major.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a very rounded major.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bachelor's of arts in liberal arts
and specializing in philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I will talk to you all
day and argue with you all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but nothing specific about the
horticulture back in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I just kind of fit into
it when I came out to Colorado and then
[SPEAKER_02]: had that friend visit, the friend of the
friend and showed me this amazing bud that
[SPEAKER_02]: he grew and that just started it in my own
mind of, hey, if this guy can do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's nothing against the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a great kid, but I felt like I
could do it at least as good as he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad, you know, that introduction
happened because without that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have never tried to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have never understood how amazing
this medicine even was in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yes, even though educationally,
I didn't get anything directly from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up working and finding my way
through, you know, my mid to late 20s and
[SPEAKER_02]: just falling in love with the plant,
realizing how much it does for me mentally
[SPEAKER_02]: and physically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just no matter where I'm at in
life, finding a place in my home to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: my own medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been lucky to where I've only
bought a very little amount of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis over the years in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a 53-year-old man right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've only bought, you know,
a handful of bags of cannabis in my whole
[SPEAKER_02]: life because of my ability to produce for
myself in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one more thing I want to say about
Colorado, because I can't give Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: enough props.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, I have to say as well for
that, even though I didn't live there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado was a sanctuary for like-minded
people like myself when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and cannabis rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, even though people would get
caught and people would get in trouble for
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating in Colorado because it was
federally illegal and state illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: statewide as well up until, you know,
the early mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: The penalties were much, much less than
most of the other states and it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: known thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in even different jurisdictions like
Boulder County, I lived in Boulder County,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado in the city of Boulder,
much less repercussions if and when you
[SPEAKER_02]: were to get caught with such a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was taken to mind and
considered as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can't thank Colorado enough for
giving me the opportunity to take some
[SPEAKER_02]: risks, but also know that I wouldn't get,
you know, the repercussions weren't nearly
[SPEAKER_02]: as bad as in many other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just I can't thank Colorado enough
for giving me such a safe haven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many people from across the country
seem to come to Colorado to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, California and Colorado seem to
be the big hubs, you know, of course
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington and Oregon as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't give enough props to my home
state of Colorado for giving me the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like it was
California first with 215, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado went recreational first,
I believe, and kind of blazed the path
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there were a lot of issues
with that early legalization and there
[SPEAKER_00]: still are so many issues with legalization
in terms of the restraint still put on
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow, even in certain cases or,
you know, how much like how they regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's a plant counter,
something like that, that's so silly and
[SPEAKER_00]: arbitrary because, you know, if you can
only grow four plants, then fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me four five by five tenths and I'll
show you how much weed I can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just silly things like that that
don't actually make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes sense in the mind of someone
who's building these different laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's never actually grown a plant
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do appreciate like certain states
that have a heavy, you know, heavy number
[SPEAKER_00]: of active individuals towards trying to
adjust some of those laws and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, I know is a big one,
California as well, I feel like does kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of help push towards different laws being
either re looked at or reviewed just to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that they aren't necessarily
causing any sort of issues with just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, like home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home grow is one of the big ones for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you were, so when was the first
year that you started growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remind me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it 94?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it was 1994.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you still grow today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand if you don't feel
comfortable talking about it, but maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about one of your more recent grows
that that was kind of using whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: felt as though was like your, your most
advanced setup, I should say advanced only
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning like the timeline in which it was
was grown in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, I recently moved to Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now I'm talking to you from Costa
Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a little town right south of
town called Haco in central on the central
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific coast so I can surf as much as I
can and live a good life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I'm very, very, very lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis has some, some to do with
that as well through my journey,
[SPEAKER_02]: helping me get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not growing currently because in
Costa Rica right now, you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can technically grow if you apply
through the ministry of Salud,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the health ministry and you apply
and it's a pretty extensive process using
[SPEAKER_02]: a doctor much more stringent than what we
have back home in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Colorado, but you can technically
grow up to six plants if you go through
[SPEAKER_02]: this process, but it's not a process that
I want to deal with right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have some local friends that can help
me out with some medicine and then have
[SPEAKER_02]: been able to at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really want to jump through those
hoops at this point, just like I did back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the States there years ago,
I'm keeping an eye on it and seeing where
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes and the easier it gets in closer
to recreational because they are heading
[SPEAKER_02]: in that direction as well, which is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as they do that, I'm sure I'll
jump in with a little home grow myself as
[SPEAKER_02]: once it's 100% legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now they don't mess around with,
they, right now they kind of lump it in
[SPEAKER_02]: with other drugs and it's just very
unfair.
[SPEAKER_02]: You getting caught, that being said,
you getting caught with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, even being a gringo like
myself, an American, no big deal at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't want you selling,
don't want you growing, providing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, transporting anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last grow I set up was a friend's
grow in a basement in a, in a very
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful concrete unfinished basement,
which is my favorite place to grow as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as home grow and nine foot ceilings
unfinished.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had had him install a mini split,
a three ton mini split system,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a very nice robust system
producing a shit ton of cooling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also had a commercial
dehumidification system set up all on
[SPEAKER_02]: stats so that humidity gets too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dehumidifier turns on same thing with
the temperature gets too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The AC turns on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turns off when needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was complete climate control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a tank based CO2 system installed as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had minimum exhaust.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a negative pressure installed so
that at the front door of the house,
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't smell any smell coming out,
any weed smell, even though it's
[SPEAKER_02]: technically legal with the plant count
that they have going.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still want to be incognito because of
the neighborhood they live in,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always usually like recommend between
300 and 600 CFM going out of the house
[SPEAKER_02]: through a filter at all times so that you
have that negative pressure at the front
[SPEAKER_02]: door and at windows and throughout the
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so climate control was completely
dialed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a top drip Rockwell slab system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with cocoa for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I switched from back maybe about 10 years
ago from Rockwell slab top trip to a cocoa
[SPEAKER_02]: system in a 10 gallon cocoa mixed with 70
30 cocoa to perlite mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I switched to the cocoa about 10 to 12
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the russet mite infestation happened
in Colorado and everybody who's grown in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado can remember the tragedy that was
the russet mites coming and taking over
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worst part about it is no one really knew
what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of us were festering around,
just freaking out, seeing these effects on
[SPEAKER_02]: our plants and not having any idea what it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only some elite people from California
knew what it was because they had been
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with it for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the interstate commerce,
which was a great thing when it came to
[SPEAKER_02]: spreading love and spreading genetics,
unfortunately also spread some really
[SPEAKER_02]: hardcore bad, bad pathogens, including
those russet mites, which to me to this
[SPEAKER_02]: day are the worst pathogen I have ever
dealt with in this in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been able to take care of them and I
know how to essentially get rid of them
[SPEAKER_02]: now and to control them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use sulfur, mainly sprayed sulfur as
opposed to the sulfur vapor because the
[SPEAKER_02]: vapor I've killed plants too many times
with it just getting a little too caustic.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little too dense as far as the vapor and
the sprayable sulfur seems to be work
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very good at about 1.5 teaspoons per
gallon of water used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it works quite well for the russet
mites and honestly for the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus mold, anything like that at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of kills a few birds with one stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the russet mites were a huge issue
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I lost my train of thought where I
was going with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like that's such an
important thing to bring up is the
[SPEAKER_00]: simplicity of using wettable sulfur to
take care of russet mites because russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites still are a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had to deal with them a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wettable sulfur always seems to be the
best way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to remind people though that
if they're using oils or mineral oils or
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils and any of their other
sprays or IPM practices to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you either give the plants a really,
really good wash with some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactant, like even just dish soap or
something like capsil, like an adjuvant
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can really get all of that extra
oil residue off the plant before you hit
[SPEAKER_00]: them with sulfur because you will melt
your plants if you combine oils and
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfurs too close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes the opposite way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to apply oils afterwards,
make sure that you are rinsing the sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: off of your plant if you just sprayed them
for russet mites or other mites or
[SPEAKER_00]: especially molds or mildews work,
you know, sulfur works really well for
[SPEAKER_00]: those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also agree, I do not like the like
sulfur burners or anything like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: atomizes the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just does seem to cause some issues and
it doesn't go away after, like the rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: just end up starting to smell like sulfur
after a while and that it doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I think- Daytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you brought that point up by the
way, Nick, about the oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a very, very good point to
bring up for people listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sulfur is incredibly effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, with the oil, it's like a toxic
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me tell you another toxic
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have humidity going, if you are
running a humidifier, you never,
[SPEAKER_02]: ever, ever want to run sulfur,
spray sulfur or use a sulfur burner
[SPEAKER_02]: because the sulfur will turn into an acid
rain, literally an acid rain and melt your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants even worse than spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mixing sulfur in oils is a horrible
thing and mixing sulfur in a humidifier is
[SPEAKER_02]: also a horrible thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then thirdly, applying, just like when
you're applying anything to plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's a good oil, beneficial oil,
or it is sulfur itself, you want to spray
[SPEAKER_02]: when those lights are off because when the
stomatas are closed, you can burn the shit
[SPEAKER_02]: out of your plants when the sulfur- Now
you can spray even a half an hour before
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights turn on, as long as they're
dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as the plants are dry by the time
the lights turn on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another thing I'd like to point
out so people don't fry their plants as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pop on a little green light or
something and spray the shit out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and then while they're dark,
let them dry before those lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so what we were talking
about before was the last grow that you
[SPEAKER_00]: had set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we just got a little bit
onto a Russet mite tangent because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good tangent to get onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say it's the worst that you've ever
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably my number two, my number one
being root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Russet mites are definitely- Winged
root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, for anybody out there that is
wondering if they're dealing with root
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids, my best advice is to know the
difference between winged root aphids and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats is fungus gnats wings lay
flat on their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root aphids stand up like the wings are
praying on their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are easy things to look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are dealing with something like
that- Good differentiator, Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I would point out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Winged root aphids fly into light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fungus gnats fly indiscriminately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, to me, that was my easiest way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a little bigger too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winged root aphids are a little
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see their wing structure better,
like you just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a brilliant point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you just watch for a second,
the winged root aphids will find their way
[SPEAKER_02]: and make their way and die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another way you can tell you
have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have dead bugs on the top of your top
leaves of your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the winged root aphids are
searching out that light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hit your light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not an LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when I was growing with a metal,
a high pressure sodium, the winged root
[SPEAKER_02]: aphid would go up, hit the light,
die, fall onto the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now on the top of the plant,
I have tens, if not tens, if not dozens,
[SPEAKER_02]: of dead, what are these bugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're winged root aphids because they're
flying to the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fungus gnats will never fly to the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just flying all over the place
just looking for a place to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was another way of being able to
differentiate the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I hate those things, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask you, Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because clearly you need a drench to deal
with winged root aphids because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding off of your roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the best way that you used to
clear those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrethrins and Bavaria bossiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Botanogard actually has the
product Botanogard Max, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrethrins and Bavaria bossiana mixed
together in an aqueous solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's super easy to mix up in a spray
applicator if you're going to do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sprench or you're actually using like a
sprayer like you would for your foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, but you're just kind of
hitting the top of the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also why I suggest always using
solid plastic pots because if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: a fabric pot, root aphids are,
they're usually permeable enough where
[SPEAKER_00]: root aphids can enter and exit that mesh
bag or that fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, pyrethrins and Bavaria bossiana
work for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else I want to throw in
there when it comes to the root aphids
[SPEAKER_02]: thing or the, excuse me, the russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had incredibly good results with
beneficial insects as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people don't like spraying
anything on their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had incredible results with from
Arbico organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was another one that's like a
little cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the top three hits on Google for
beneficial insects though, but predatory
[SPEAKER_02]: mites, predatory mites, Californicus,
Swirsky and Andersoni.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the three Latin names of the
beneficial mites that kick ass on russet
[SPEAKER_02]: mites, curcumin mites, all the most evil
mites that you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beneficial mites were incredibly
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best way was a two, two part
treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would do is I would spray a little
bit of water as a kind of a surfactant so
[SPEAKER_02]: that the things that the bugs that I would
sprinkle on them would stick to the leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: that are so I would spray with a little
backpack sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some pH balanced water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the first thing I'd do is I would
shake the ready to use bugs that were just
[SPEAKER_02]: like ready, just chomping at the bit to
eat, shake those immediately on my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the same time, they have these
little, they're called sachets,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are these little packets of,
of bugs that have bugs of all stages
[SPEAKER_02]: inside of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they continue to breed inside the bag
and to go out the little holes that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have in the little sachets and they'll go
out on their own, search out the bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: come back to their little nests inside the
sachets and have a little environment for
[SPEAKER_02]: two, three, even four weeks, they'll stay
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would have the ready to use that
would knock them down immediately within
[SPEAKER_02]: the first day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally 24 hours later,
see my plants look healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 hours later is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then throughout the next week,
as the sachets are starting to do their
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, have better and better and better
benefits or better, uh, uh, better
[SPEAKER_02]: recovery of these plants that were damaged
from the, the, the russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single day from those sachets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to drop a little money on
these, but, but a hundred percent organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they don't hurt any, anything else in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just really go and attack what
they need to attack, which is those russet
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't speak highly enough of those
beneficial, uh, predator mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I've used predator mites before for
things like fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I, I, and we've used them as well
for like two spots, spider mites and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've never used them for russet mites,
but I'm glad to hear that they've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: for other people in that, especially for
those people out there, giving them an
[SPEAKER_00]: option if they are trying to avoid
spraying, um, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: after you get past week, you know,
three, maybe four at the latest,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you, you really don't want to be
spraying too much at all anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, you know, there's some
things you just want to spray in flower at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't want to spray sulfur at all
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, if you're in a commercial setting,
you're going to pop for sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, it's important to know your
limitations there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, have you ever tried nematodes for the
fungus gnats?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the best results with the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using these new one from,
uh, I think it's called like Sierra
[SPEAKER_00]: naturals is the company that makes the,
uh, the nematodes that we've been getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been coming in on these little
tiny sponges rather than in the cake form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just pop them into your, into your
mixing tank with your aerating stone and
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your circulating pump and you're off
to the races.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using nematodes though,
just remember to apply them through a,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a diaphragm pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't apply them through any sort of a
siphon pump or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the pressure that builds up in
the system, as well as the like chopping
[SPEAKER_00]: action of the actual motor can cause the,
uh, nematodes to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they are little tiny living,
they look like little worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if, if you need to have a reference,
look, look back to that episode of
[SPEAKER_00]: Spongebob square pants that has the
nematodes eating everything in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just like that, but they're,
they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know what I did Nick to get around
that though, because of the pump thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like they're even more
effective because they don't want to live
[SPEAKER_02]: underwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like, they need a little bit of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so what I would do is I would mix
them up in a five gallon bucket,
[SPEAKER_02]: like heavy concentration, you know,
like 10 million or whatever the count was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a heavy and I would just hand water
the top of every one of my plants that had
[SPEAKER_02]: the nematode or excuse me, that had the
fungus net, um, infestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll just hand top that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would never even add them to my
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just add this mega high
concentration of nematodes to the top of
[SPEAKER_02]: every one of my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, being in Colorado,
my plant count was always, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the tens as opposed to a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, it was feasible to do,
you know, 20 plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: top grass like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was incredibly effective for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do only need to soak the top inch
or two of any pot size because that's the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the depth that wish, which, um,
the nema or the fungus net larva are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually living.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be much deeper into
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think those are all great tips
for people that are battling a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different, uh, pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't, we don't actually get
into pest control too often here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel like it is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really glad that you brought it
up, uh, you know, just with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Russet might be a thread of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, can you talk a little bit about,
uh, transitioning from being a home grower
[SPEAKER_00]: into your time spent in the retail space
for different grow equipment and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I did my, my transition was
kind of twofold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from the home grow underground
cannabis cultivation to the, to number one
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial cultivation, because I got into
commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I set up a grow in, in a set in a part
of Boulder, um, it's called gun barrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a little, it's, it's still in
Boulder city, but it's on the outskirts of
[SPEAKER_02]: Boulder and it's where a little mini
warehouse zone is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was one of the first places
Boulder city allowed and zoned for back
[SPEAKER_02]: when the laws passed, zoned for commercial
cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in gun barrel, I was the, was the
first warehouse that opened up there,
[SPEAKER_02]: my little warehouse with a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just back in the day where you
had a notebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of caregivers, uh, or I was a caregiver
for a notebook of patients and of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that needed care and needed medicine and,
uh, were able to legally buy it from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to legally sell it to them,
but I had to have a notebook filled with
[SPEAKER_02]: their kind of licensed paperwork and stuff
showing the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that was my first commercial grow
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was about a 50 light, uh,
operation with, uh, like 18 foot high
[SPEAKER_02]: ceilings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I brought in a 10 ton HVAC unit,
which blew me away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, my house at the time had a
three tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was like, wow, this is so big and
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and, and it was just,
it was just so groundbreaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we didn't have electricians that
were used to hooking up lights like this
[SPEAKER_02]: yet and running this much conduit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't, we didn't have plumbers
that were willing to do the jobs needed
[SPEAKER_02]: for the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was just really groundbreaking
and it was hard finding subs and finding,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, engineers honestly as well to figure
out, um, a BT use of heat created from
[SPEAKER_02]: each light and depending on what light
technology it was, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first foray was into the growing
commercial side of it, um, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I absolutely loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up working for, uh,
myself, like I said, at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then a commercial dispensary called
sweet leaf compassion center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was the head grower for that for a
year until it was just found out through
[SPEAKER_02]: the local jurisdiction that it was about
25 feet too close to a school and had to
[SPEAKER_02]: be shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just some of those ridiculous
laws, but so that, that gave me a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: taste for the commercial side of the
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got out of that, um, at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, a little actually before that
though, I got into the, um, into the side
[SPEAKER_02]: of retail hydroponics and opened a store
with a friend in Asheville, North
[SPEAKER_02]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, that was quite a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually, um, and 19,
let's see, that was right around 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so maybe about five years or so after
I started growing, I opened this little
[SPEAKER_02]: grow store in Asheville and Asheville was
kind of like a boulder of the East coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an epicenter where growers and
like-minded people came to help each other
[SPEAKER_02]: out, to be a community, to know they're
safe, know that the laws for getting
[SPEAKER_02]: caught wouldn't put you in jail for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is North Carolina, but it's a different
kind of feel in North Carolina being
[SPEAKER_02]: Asheville.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my store was called Asheville
agricultural systems and it opened up in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in 1999, right around 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just last about two years ago,
we sold it in, in addition with four other
[SPEAKER_02]: stores that we had opened subsequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had five stores in total throughout
North Carolina and one in West Virginia,
[SPEAKER_02]: one in Virginia as well in
Charlottesville.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sold those and made some good
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to buy this house in Costa
Rica with my proceeds from the sale of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, taking my, you know, getting into that
and learning retail and, and I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: little retail experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom owned a little perfume store when I
was young and on the main street in my
[SPEAKER_02]: town.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned how to do inventory and
ordering and customer service and how to
[SPEAKER_02]: greet people and how to restock shelves
when, you know, par levels got low,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took that a little bit of that
knowledge with my mama and took it into
[SPEAKER_02]: the hydro store in Asheville.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very successful with that store
and ended up opening, as I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: four more with the help of my
brother-in-law and my sister, who did an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, amazing job, Ashley and Richard,
um, and just kind of took it, took it
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, I didn't live in North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't run the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they, they basically helped,
uh, launch it into the stratosphere and to
[SPEAKER_02]: a place where we could eventually sell it
and, uh, all make good money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're both now retired from it as
well from their hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm, uh, semi retired, but not exactly
retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, I still run a, a, uh, legal
marijuana cannabis business in Denver
[SPEAKER_02]: called luminescence labs going by Denver
Dabco, which is a cannabis extraction lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, based out of Evergreen, Colorado right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is that the kind of the, the entire
business is they just make concentrates at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my current cannabis businesses,
uh, Denver Dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we basically are a hydrocarbon
extraction lab and we use butane and
[SPEAKER_02]: propane, mainly butane at different
concentrations, depending on what
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency we're trying to get at the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do live resins, live batters.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do sugar wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do regular wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've done cartridges in the past and
we'll probably have some live resin
[SPEAKER_02]: cartridges in the future again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, we're just a concentrate
lab and we sell wholesale to dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: across the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and yeah, we love what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I produce, we produce concentrates all day
long, but I still have to say flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers still my favorite personally,
even though I love and give major props to
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates and connoisseurs of such,
but my personal favorite still,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, some very good flower and,
you know, the whole tactile part of
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking it up and smelling it and
experiencing the bud and the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: the packing it into the bowl or loading a
cone or twisting a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I very much still enjoy consuming
cannabis on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I prefer flower over concentrates,
although I do love concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like, uh, you know, I always,
it was really, it was a weird experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I used a blow torch to heat
up glass, to smoke some, some
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and so now I just use like one of
those puff codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the electric, uh, dab rigs
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but other than that, I just,
I enjoy vaporizing my flower because I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked too many cigarettes when I was
younger and smoking joints now just ends
[SPEAKER_00]: up making me a little bit wheezy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, flower all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I very much enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I do enjoy concentrates from a pen,
like you're suggesting as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, especially, you know, with,
you're on a lift going skiing,
[SPEAKER_02]: snowboarding, you know, you're driving in
the car, well, you know, sitting at a park
[SPEAKER_02]: in the car or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just more handy to have an apparatus
like that as opposed to dealing with the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a time and a place for,
for all of these methodologies for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so with, uh, it sounds like you were a
fan of hydroponics, uh, throughout your
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growing career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever, uh, dabble into any sort of
like living soil organics or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have dabbled, but I have to,
you know, I have to admit failure when
[SPEAKER_02]: there's failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was not able to be, I tried to do the
organic soil growing route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now living soil hadn't really caught on
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, clearly plenty of people were
doing living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but in the cannabis world,
it hadn't really taken hold yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, there wasn't that much
information about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hadn't really been turned on to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't really know of the incredible
benefits of the sustainability of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible how sustainable it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people currently that are using the
same pots 10, 15 cycles in just top
[SPEAKER_02]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible what they're able to do
with this living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I was not able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at the time, and like I said,
it was 10 years ago when I tried it and I
[SPEAKER_02]: did more, more than just standard organic
soil route and my harvests were decent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they didn't touch the quality and the
quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause frankly, I was into the quantity as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I was making some money
and, and so I wasn't able to really get
[SPEAKER_02]: the bang that I, that other people that I
knew were able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave it a few tries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it four or five cycles worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was happy with the quality and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy with, uh, the cannabis I was
consuming from it, but it just didn't make
[SPEAKER_02]: sense in the space I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could literally grow about twice as much
with my hydro techniques that I had dialed
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that being the case, I went back to
hydro and stayed that way and have
[SPEAKER_02]: modified with organic top dressings,
even with hydro and, uh, played around
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of different methodologies
within hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the organic thing, I let go because of
my inability to be a very good organic
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my specialty was in hydro and I just
kind of locked in with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I do, I do enjoy organic,
but here and there, and I get it from a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of friends that are masters at that
living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do get to indulge as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think we are a little bit
lucky nowadays to have all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that have these, um,
built, you know, uh, amended soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates that are geared exactly towards
a full cannabis cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you use this many gallons
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You water it, you never let it run off and
you take it all the way from a seedling to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas trying to figure it out
before, you know, like there were very few
[SPEAKER_00]: products available 10 years ago,
like what maybe Fox farm ocean forest or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, that you were able to
try an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but even that it had different salts
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't geared specifically towards
cannabis, even though there was a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of like a Fox farm is kind of
a cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it, I can understand how it would have
been difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even for myself, I've grown
organically a few times, but I always come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to synthetic or not synthetic,
but salt based fertilizers, because it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you can, you can change everything on
a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to do any sort of soil
testing analysis that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you might need like a degree and,
uh, organic chemistry to truly understand
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown and make a smart educated
decision on what your next inputs are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and inputs alone, you know,
there's the standardization of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: salt based nutrients, you know,
like mono potassium phosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium nitrate, calcium chloride,
uh, all the different sulfates that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use, you know, molybdenum sulfate,
manganese sulfate, all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things are so standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so, they're so uniform that you
can source them from different areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, even if some of them have a higher
quality than another, uh, with less
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities, less heavy metals,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that all usually is available
through testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that information is there,
but you know, every batch of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: fish hydrolystate might be slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every batch of, uh, bat guano or a sea
bird guano, depending on where it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from is going to be slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, um, there, there's a consistency
with salts that I really like as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, indeed, when you were growing,
did you think, or did you see that any of
[SPEAKER_00]: your techniques were something that you
didn't see other people using,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that you felt were a key to your
success in the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, you know, some, um,
one of the things I use, if you know those
[SPEAKER_02]: plant yo-yos, have you seen those things
that are on a spring?
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably got a few behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were out a long time before,
right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were out quite, they're come,
the original ones come from Holland and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I first saw them like 30 years
ago, I was like, wow, this is ingenious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they were sold for tomatoes,
but they weren't taunt enough to hold a
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we knew what they were really meant
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're made for cannabis for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being from Holland, um, but I never
really saw these in many grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw them at the grow store and I brought
a few in and then started bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of them in because they worked so
very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is the one thing that out of
all the grows I've had and set people up
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, my grows look a little different
because instead of stakes and many people
[SPEAKER_02]: or trellis, those are the two main,
you know, the trellis net or people
[SPEAKER_02]: staking their plants up and their coal is
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this yo-yo, yo-yo system was a system
that seemed to differentiate my grows from
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would do is I would take,
let's say you had a four by eight tent and
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got the posts, the vertical posts
to the four by eight tent, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take a 10 gauge wire, um,
that was coated with rubber, like a wire
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd get on a spool at a hardware store
and run that wire around the diameter
[SPEAKER_02]: perimeter of the, of the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the outside of the pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a perimeter of wire,
like a fence, a wire, a wire fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would do one at about two feet,
two, two feet off the ground and then one
[SPEAKER_02]: at about five feet off the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one right in the center under
where the lights are, like right in the
[SPEAKER_02]: center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically it is a grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The perimeter of wire around the four by
eight would be where all of those yo-yos
[SPEAKER_02]: would be attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the whole perimeter of the tent on
the inside would have hundreds of these
[SPEAKER_02]: yo-yos just strung around up high and down
below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, as you know, in cultivation,
um, to maximize your harvest, every place
[SPEAKER_02]: in your tent that has light, you want to
have green there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have a leaf, a cola,
a part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want any light hitting the floor
essentially to have a maximized garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these yo-yos, I was able to basically
take from a early, you know, from early on
[SPEAKER_02]: in my growing, I was able to absolutely
maximize every square inch of light that I
[SPEAKER_02]: had in a grow by taking these yo-yos and
taking not because, you know, yo-yos and
[SPEAKER_02]: stakes and trellis are used for two
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're used for support so the plants
just don't drop down and fall to the
[SPEAKER_02]: floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're also used for straight up
manipulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're putting that cola or what have
you exactly where you want it to be to
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize its light or its ability to get
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the yo-yos are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm able to like hook the hook around
the cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then look, look at the canopy and go,
okay, that's a perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a spot where light was hitting the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's the cola's right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would clip the yo-yo right
there onto the wire and it's set and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: on a spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as it grows, it doesn't have to be
reattached.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to weave it under a trellis
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to, you know, fix something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of one and done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hook it on and since it's on a spring
and it grows, it just keeps growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: that direction and it's set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that right there, is probably the
way I maximize my, my harvest throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: my career is because of that manipulation
technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that's very important
that we kind of talk about the
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization of it or the illegality of it
back in the day is Colorado was one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those states that plant count mattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still matters in, in, in, in many,
in many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, six plants you're able to grow
as, you know, recreational user,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, but count matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you were saying earlier,
you could grow six, massive plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: that technically is, that's totally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's six plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did that as just a person that,
you know, I'm not a big fan of jail and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I never wanted to even test those
waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always grew the fewest possible
plants in a given space as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in, you know, some people would have
like a sea of green and have like 50
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in a four by eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a four by eight, I would have no more
than eight plants, no more than eight
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very important that through
that yo-yo technique or what have you,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I maximize every square inch of
production space because I only have eight
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very important to maximize
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CO2 is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yo-yos and plant manipulation was very
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clipping leaves every two weeks is very,
very, very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping things clean was very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just very anal because every plant I
had was so important to produce because I
[SPEAKER_02]: only had a select amount of plants trying
to minimize my plant count throughout my
[SPEAKER_02]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say clipping leaves, do you mean
like removing the extra fan leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are shading out flowering sites,
or are you actually going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting off some of those extra sugar
leaves or the leaves that are more close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Primarily, primarily fans and mid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I never clip sweet leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, those are too important and I don't
want to shock the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have shocked plants before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different strains react differently to
leaf clippings and you have to just know
[SPEAKER_02]: that as a grower or just test it out
yourself and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew, in my career, AK-47 was the strain
that I grew and made most of my money and
[SPEAKER_02]: had most of my success from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the best AK-47 fino that I had
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it's skill, some of it's luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of luck, Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting that AK fino from Netherland,
Colorado, which was a little grow town
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of Boulder, changed the course of
my growing career.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally set me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so different strains react differently
to that leaf pulling and the AK didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: like it very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the most I could do with the AK was
just a moderate major fan leaf only,
[SPEAKER_02]: the giant fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a lot of the strains today,
you can go in and like you look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Jungle Boys, you look at some of these
guys, these three per guys, two per guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are stripping and it's part of their
protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every two to three weeks they go in,
like when they kick in a bloom,
[SPEAKER_02]: they strip it completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, three weeks later, they strip it
completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two to three layers one more time and then
it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just leery because of my experience
with my AK, but absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mess with the sweet leaf,
but stripping those, very, very least
[SPEAKER_02]: stripping the fans significantly helps the
end product, the trichome production.
[SPEAKER_02]: That direct sunlight seems to produce more
trichomes and obviously bigger and better
[SPEAKER_02]: swollen colas as well when you got that
direct light.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the leaf stripping as well as like a
day 21 prune at the facility that I manage
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are able to push numbers up really
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of our most recent harvest was
my personal best and it should be just
[SPEAKER_00]: over three pounds per four by four area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really pushing it as hard as we
could and a leaf strip was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: required, not only just for the light
access to all the flowers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering sites, but also for
environmental maintenance and air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation and all these things that
really help promote ripening and bud
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen a lot of different aspects of
the cultivation space, from home grower to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grower to retail shop owner and
not only just doing it in one space and in
[SPEAKER_00]: one community, but seeing the trends
across multiple communities, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from that retail viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: With everything that you have seen change
in the industry over the past 30 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: years, what are some of the things that
you think might be changing continuously?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see the market or the
industry going?
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as what are some of the things
that you would like to see change within
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry?
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trends wise, some of the things I'm seeing
are just continuing and furthering
[SPEAKER_02]: automation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I briefly mentioned before,
the sensors that can pick up the humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: in a media, whether it's in your cocoa pot
or in your rock wall and be able to send
[SPEAKER_02]: you an alert on your phone, no matter
where you are and let you know that things
[SPEAKER_02]: are gonna die soon because they don't have
enough water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was screaming for that 20 years ago,
but we just didn't have the technology
[SPEAKER_02]: back then to produce something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the margins, the
commercial market, which is really pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: most of this is the commercial market,
is capitalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capitalism means the people who own the
owners want more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the way capitalism is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A harvest can be a great harvest,
but the next harvest, the capitalist is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna want a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just unfortunately the world we
live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being the case, in this industry,
we're striving for a little more harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology's gonna increase in advance
all in the hopes of getting better quality
[SPEAKER_02]: bud, better quality medicine, but getting
more of it per square foot, per watt,
[SPEAKER_02]: per dollar spent by the owners of the
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: These technologies from humidity sensing
to environmental controls that I said
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier that can be drawn up on your
smartphone and you can turn a fan on,
[SPEAKER_02]: off manually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're gonna be on automated
settings to turn on and off themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think these things that are helping
people put less actual physical time into
[SPEAKER_02]: it and take that burden off of us and do
it automatically I think are gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to be pushed forward in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot more automation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think honestly computers and robots
frankly are gonna continue to push as well
[SPEAKER_02]: and cut people out of the workforce
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whether it's harvesting, I saw some
apples being harvested by drones the other
[SPEAKER_02]: day online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a matter of time before this is
automated as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: As anyone who's worked in a commercial
grow like yourself, Nick, golly,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, the trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so laborious, but we still don't have
bad ass trimmers yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting there and they're getting
better, but that kind of automation I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is gonna save a ridiculous amount of
money, increase margin significantly for
[SPEAKER_02]: these companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I see automation because in a
capitalist society, and us wanting more
[SPEAKER_02]: and more, that's where the demand is gonna
be as far as just maximizing every crop
[SPEAKER_02]: that much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think automation is the only way to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see that as being a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And conversely, it takes away a lot of
what we love about the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the hands-on part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what got you, I'm sure,
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what got me into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hands-on, the watching it every
day and not just looking at my phone and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at data or looking at a
spreadsheet, but getting in there and
[SPEAKER_02]: being part of the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And watching it grow every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that makes me a little sad is that
with this amazing automation that we have,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're taking a little bit of the personal
aspect out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, the best way to keep a
plant healthy is to look at it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we said, smelling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell if something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can certainly see if something's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see a bean popping out or a male
flower popping out because you're in there
[SPEAKER_02]: every day and you're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everything's automated, you're not
looking as diligently, shit falls through
[SPEAKER_02]: the cracks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That powdery mildew pops up and you don't
see it until it's four days too late and
[SPEAKER_02]: then everything's got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as much as automation is bad ass,
we still need good master growers and
[SPEAKER_02]: helpers to be in those grows every day,
getting down on their knees, clipping
[SPEAKER_02]: those lower leaves, looking at the stalks,
looking at the top of the rockle cubes for
[SPEAKER_02]: the winged root aphids, looking for the
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we find trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we prevent trouble and that's
how we modify and pivot to continually
[SPEAKER_02]: have good gardens is because of the
hands-on aspect and being very involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm a little afraid of the
automation side taking away of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's tricky because it brings so much
goodness to it, but we don't want too much
[SPEAKER_02]: of it because we still need to be involved
every day to avoid the other pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely like two sides of the
same coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a lot of automation at the
facility that I work at, but we always say
[SPEAKER_00]: that automation is not a replacement for
observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really do need to make sure
that you are getting into the grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: confirming with your own eyes what the
data is telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the data lead you, let it
confirm what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kind of speaking along those
same lines of, you know, it's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: pitfall to allow yourself to only look at
the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in some cases now to be
able to keep up with the market trends,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost a similar pitfall to not use
any data whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in the same sort of line of
thought of pitfalls in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are some of the ones that you are
seeing new and old growers face nowadays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just different pitfalls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of the same old ones I'm
seeing, you know, whether it's the bugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the bugs, the disease,
you know, the automation is helping these
[SPEAKER_02]: to thwart these things, but they're still
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's still humidity issues
and it's hard to keep that in check,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in humid environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can't imagine growing in Costa
Rica, like the amount of equipment I would
[SPEAKER_02]: want to install day one before even
getting started, the hardcore
[SPEAKER_02]: dehumidification that I never had to
really deal with in Colorado, the air
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioning, the, you know, the scopes
that I would look at, because the million
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of bugs that live down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it seems to be a lot of
the same pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just we have different tools to work
with them now, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, spider mites, russet mites,
and winged root aphids are still three,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion, biggest pitfalls on the bug
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then powdery mildew and then botrytis,
bud rot are the two big things on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the pathogen side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some, you know, funk in the
water, but we've got cleanse now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, by Athena and that, that,
that, that chemical that, what is the name
[SPEAKER_02]: of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick, I'm drawing a blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hyperchlorous acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's HOCl.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one hydrogen, one oxygen, one chlorine
atom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems to have revolutionized many
people that I know with gardens right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they just added, because,
you know, a lot of people went to feed to
[SPEAKER_02]: waste because they couldn't deal with that
recirculating water and just contaminating
[SPEAKER_02]: their whole garden, because everything was
feed, was recirculating up until,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people started getting smart and
doing the feed to waste to eliminate that
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with the cleanse, with this
hypostatic acid, you can go for a month
[SPEAKER_02]: without changing a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people who have 30 day reservoirs
that are as clean as ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their tubes don't get clogged as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's definitely some products
that I would have died for 20 years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: that are coming out now that are helping
with these minor pitfalls, but it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping things clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you said earlier,
clean, you know, cleaning up the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps the air flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes out humidity intent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humidity is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can get too high very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take out some leaves, do a minor leaf
pool, even on the bottoms, your humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to jump up or excuse me,
jump down five percentage points
[SPEAKER_02]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping the leaves off the bottom,
don't give the, the, the bugs a place to
[SPEAKER_02]: fester, to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be in your room every day, every night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your eyes are your best friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your senses are your best friend,
your nose, your ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cleanliness, really from day one,
cleanliness is your number one friend when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes to a garden, even in an organic
soil garden, you know, just keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep, you know, just keep it running
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take notes when you apply things,
take notes of those days when you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, notes are so good to write.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep calendars on the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have calendars like with month after
month straight down so I can very easily
[SPEAKER_02]: calculate things out, whether it's cloning
dates or harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I write notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I'm spraying sulfur this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know to follow up three days later with
another hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I just, data is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can't keep enough data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't keep enough notes and just
keeping the cleanest garden to me is the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I think that it's really
interesting that we are almost
[SPEAKER_00]: rediscovering certain things and that
they're being implemented into cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for instance, with that
hypochlorous acid, right, it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it, it goes through just a
process of electrolysis where you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: adding something to plain water,
like potassium chloride or sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're just applying electricity
to that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that electricity, you're
stripping apart the two different
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents and recombining them into
this now clean, non-toxic chlorine liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, that you can apply to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not sodium hypochlorite,
like what you would find in bleach,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's going to actually cause issues
with the plant by adding these sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: atoms, especially if you're using
potassium chloride as your base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that we had the ability
to do for, you know, over a hundred years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we just never thought to apply it in
this manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when, you know, I'm, I really love
the fact that you are an old school
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, but that you are excited about
these new products because you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: usefulness in their application,
where I do feel as though there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of older growers who tend to be stuck in
their ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that, you know, there,
if it, if it's not broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that, but also always being open
to these new ideas, new concepts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and new methodologies, I feel like is it's
how we, as humans continue to learn and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and, and better ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like that you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that you brought that up as
something that you were excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing it come into use and seeing the
efficacy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of this information that you have
as well, all of this knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would be some advice that you would
give to new growers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, new growers have, have so many
wonderful resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube, YouTube is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, just dive in, give it a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so safe now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about the legality
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it, depending on what state you're
in, I think there are what's 15 states
[SPEAKER_02]: still that I have draconian laws,
but, but it's getting there every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pushing closer to total legalization
in the whole country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just so many less worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say absolutely go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely use YouTube for,
for, for resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are just so many videos,
you know, from guys like me that just
[SPEAKER_02]: have, just love to help and share
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there used to be a lot of stuck
up growers out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really were a lot of jerks that,
that didn't want to spread the love and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were holding onto their little
secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing good about things going
on in society now in this cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: movement and being so out there is it's
very open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open source now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I want, I don't want to hold on to my,
I want to spread the love and teach
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone that, that needs or wants to know
what I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can come back and teach me
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, I, I am, I am only so smart as I
know how much I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I know a lot about horticulture and
about cannabis in general, but I know
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a shit ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to know more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have been open minded enough to
know that there are not only new products
[SPEAKER_02]: that can give me better results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had before, if I have an open
mind to try them, but there's also people
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe have been growing for only a
few years, but have had a different path
[SPEAKER_02]: that can show me something that I haven't
experienced before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have a very open mind and I just
want to produce the best tastiest,
[SPEAKER_02]: most effective cannabis I can produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I'm not the best at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one is the best at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always someone that knows more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have a very open mind about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that a beginning grower has
so a beginner grower has so many wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to go ahead and just do it,
don't put it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give it a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even one little plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a friend with cuttings,
I would suggest maybe starting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's just so easy to know you have a
genetic and for those that don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, clones are a genetic duplicate
of the host plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the person is having good results
with this one plant, if you take a clone
[SPEAKER_02]: from them or they give you a rooted clone,
preferably a rooted clone you would get
[SPEAKER_02]: and put it in your system, then the
chances of success are astronomically
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to starting with a seed and you
have other things, you know, sexing the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed and even though it's probably a
female that still could be a male and then
[SPEAKER_02]: yada yada is the right phenos and writing
the different phenos and keeping a mom of
[SPEAKER_02]: all those phenos in case which one is the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just don't even deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a good cutting from a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're in a state that it's legal,
go to a store, even buy a cutting if you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to, if you don't have a friend that
has one and start that way and start with
[SPEAKER_02]: a little, a little system, whether it's,
you know, soil, cocoa or hydroponic,
[SPEAKER_02]: all three are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: To start, if you really want it easiest,
pop it in a thing, an ocean forest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Fox farm soil, and just watch it grow and
just give it water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to do anything else and
just watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be your first foray into it
because it really requires nothing but
[SPEAKER_02]: water and a little sunlight and your
windowsill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's so many ways to
take it and advance it from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like I said, the YouTube videos and
the resources out there are, I'm envious
[SPEAKER_02]: of those resources considering what I had
when I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say just reach out there and but
don't, don't put it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dive in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's an amazing, amazing venture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree wholeheartedly with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't put it off anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just if you, if you have seeds,
get that seed wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a ability to get a clone,
I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest clones all the way for a first
time grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make your life really easy right off
the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Drew, that was, this was an amazing
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that about wraps it up for
some of the main questions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do always like to ask a couple
little wrap up questions just to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: round out the whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've smoked for a long time,
so you probably have experienced a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since you are a grower with this much
experience, I'm going to break this
[SPEAKER_00]: question up into two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your favorite strain to grow of
all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I might have a little inkling
of an idea of what you might say
[SPEAKER_00]: considering what you said earlier about
the AK-47B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being sort of your bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's not it, I, I am all for
hearing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was your favorite to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you were right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The AK-47 was so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just say why.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a grower, it was giant arm size colas
and as fat as my forearm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a skinny dude, but I, you know,
still that's a huge cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is back in the day where people
were very much into showing off the size
[SPEAKER_02]: of their colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having a cola that big was a cool
thing nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like, oh, all that stick
weight and stem weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants a cola that big now,
but back in the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 20, even 30 years ago, that was like,
people were like, when they saw a cola
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to give credit where credit's due.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was blessed with the best, one of the
best genetics still to this day I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the smell of that AK Nick was what
really set it apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those buds that when you
were at a party or a get together and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in the corner of the room and you
whipped out your AK Nug, everybody did
[SPEAKER_02]: this and looked at your corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like within seconds, it was known.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of a kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: No other plants smelled like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chronic smelled like skunk, but AK had its
own such a unique smell that everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: knew it and everybody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was the nastiest gaseous with a
little bit of fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loved the AK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was, it was props being able to
have that and, and getting that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was very weighty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing back in the day off of
thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing two pounds plus two and a
half pounds of light all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: All day long on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cloned in seven days, eight days,
both in clone machines and in one inch
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockwell with domes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bug resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, it fired on all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally the smoke of it was
delightful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a high, it was a true hybrid mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guessed it around 50 50 based on my
effects or the effects on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could sleep on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good pain reliever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incredibly tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was just the, the best all
around for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now since then, you know, with all of
these boutique bougie strains coming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got some, you know, friends that,
that work at clone, which have amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics over at clone Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also at free world genetics, Sam and
Austin who run that are two amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: savants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bad ass at what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love their genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorites was called orange
cookie chem, which was a free world
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was absolutely delightful and white
with trichomes, super tasty with that
[SPEAKER_02]: orangey tangy kind of back tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely delicious medium yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is strictly for flavor and effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and let's see, I think right now I
would have to say this, this strain called
[SPEAKER_02]: free Mac, which is actually another one of
the free world genetic strains that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was kind of fired on all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was very, very stony, big,
big buds, dense buds, got a little rot
[SPEAKER_02]: here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't really watch your humidity,
you want to keep it under 50 if you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just fired on all cylinders,
easy to, you know, two pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were under a thauy or if you're
with led, you know, you could get a pound
[SPEAKER_02]: off of a 600, you know, a pound and a half
off a 600 watt, maybe even two pounds off
[SPEAKER_02]: a 630 watt four by four led light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an incredible plant, but very,
very stony, a little on the Indica side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer a little on the Indica side
because I'm looking for a lot of pain
[SPEAKER_02]: relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a chronic back, low back pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica's usually helped me a little more
on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say the free Mac and the AK were my
two favorites overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the diesels as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York city and some sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still a fan of those as well,
but I love trying new bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone has another strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to try it, especially when I'm
sober, because I like to get a very good
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion on, you know, the taste,
how it tickles my throat, how it tickles
[SPEAKER_02]: my nose with the terpene effect,
and then of course the effect 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the free Mac sort of their version of
the Miracle Alien cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's the Miracle Alien cookies
mixed with their free world chem,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a more chem-y Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sounds awesome.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the colas were very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The much bigger colas, because as you
know, the Miracle Alien cookies has very
[SPEAKER_02]: small little nectar buds, but they're
small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the free Mac is like three,
four, five times the size of colas than
[SPEAKER_02]: the Miracle Alien cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything those guys do, honestly,
Nick, is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody has a chance to hook up with
free world genetics, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you know them personally and you
want to help me get them on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have them and hear more about
their story too.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the next question may have
already been answered, but feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: just run with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is your favorite breeder of all time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you know, old school DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to keep coming back to my boys,
man, but Sam and Austin, free world
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been taking care of me for like
five years, six years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just really cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work with you personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really like their personal touch to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I say, I'm friends with both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not like some big corporate
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like some online company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can really talk to them on a personal
level and tell them what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will sit me down and say,
hold on, let me put some thought in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew, let me call you back in 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me call Austin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let, you know, see what he has to say
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, I think it's free world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I like some of the old
school, like I say, DJ Short did some
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, amazing things for, for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really an innovator in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but I'd like to say Sam and Austin
with free world are my favorite guys
[SPEAKER_02]: because of what they're doing currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, we did a show with DJ Short
and it was a great episode talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: his blueberry and his flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, um, yeah, it would be great to
get more breeders on here to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: About their strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I need to watch that episode,
Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was with our, our cohost,
uh, Gabby Bronstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also known as Gabby Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy that brought the,
uh, the sour diesel out from the East
[SPEAKER_00]: coast to the West coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was a really fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's see last question then just
to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your most memorable cannabis
related experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably my first time to Red Rocks
amphitheater and going to see a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think it was blues traveler back
maybe 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to come to Red Rocks every 4th
of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if everybody knows that
Red Rocks is, but it's like the best bad
[SPEAKER_02]: ass amphitheater in the world,
maybe, but in the country for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's set between these two massive red
sandstone rocks shooting out of the earth,
[SPEAKER_02]: overlooking the city of Denver with this
mountain range in front of it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you're rocking with like 8,000
like-minded, amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, the moon, July 4th, every year
rises out of the horizon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the moon, when it's coming
up is always bigger looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see this glow and everybody in the
stand starts to kind of scream wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're watching the globe before the
movie even comes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got goosebumps even talking about
this right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got some, you know, killer
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it was AK back in the day,
if it was 20 years ago, I had a fat bowl
[SPEAKER_02]: of AK, if not a few joints going around
and spreading the love with everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's starting to scream as
this, the moon is rising and it's full
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, in the, in the music's playing
and blues traveler was just popping back
[SPEAKER_02]: then to there at the top, you know,
everybody was grooving to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like, everybody's like
hugging everybody and passing around
[SPEAKER_02]: joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I say, I got goosebumps right now
thinking about it, but that was quite
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly the best cannabis related
experience sharing the cannabis with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew with people around me,
complimenting me, you know, always a
[SPEAKER_02]: little pat on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't like to be too egoistic
about this, but it was, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sharing and everybody hugging and
the moon rising and the music and the red
[SPEAKER_02]: rocks and me being like my first few years
living in Colorado after moving from
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida, it was a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and cannabis only helped that become
that, you know, without the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would have been good, but it was just,
it brought everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like an Epic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure a lot of people have similar
experiences, whether it be with music or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, some sort of event or gathering where
they're passing around some flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vibe is already nice and high and,
and positive and uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're just sharing that extra
experience, you know, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a little bit egotistic, but it's
always so great to get a pat on your back
[SPEAKER_00]: for the flower that you, that you grew
that everyone else is enjoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wholeheartedly understand how that
feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, man, Drew, this has been a great
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to reach out to Jared
and thank him for pointing you in my
[SPEAKER_00]: direction or me in your direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that, you know, we've touched
on some really great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great subjects today, just like general
grow knowledge, IPM knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: your experience and your journey through
this, this, uh, this world, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a, as a cannabis person, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a fun, this was a really fun
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I really always like to end these
episodes by reminding people that the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why we have these conversations is
because it's so important to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: information out there to people,
uh, just to, to have a real conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about cannabis and how we all
experience it as both growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers and getting that information out
there to people is the way we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, uh, you know, for the namesake
of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you so much for joining me
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time and your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the name of your podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's touching.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is how, how we progress and move
forward is to talk about the way we grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, everybody has a little bit
different take and, and sharing our
[SPEAKER_02]: stories is how we progress this movement
and how we push it forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a pleasure and an honor to be on
your show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so glad Jared introduced us and,
uh, and, uh, I'm going to be diving into
[SPEAKER_02]: all your other episodes and checking them
out right away.
