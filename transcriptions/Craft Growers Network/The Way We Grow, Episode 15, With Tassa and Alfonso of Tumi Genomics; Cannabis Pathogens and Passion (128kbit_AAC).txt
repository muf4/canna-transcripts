[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast, a production of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Nick Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we actually have two guests in the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is Chief Science Officer, Dr. Tassa
Saldi, and Research Director, Dr. Alfonso
[SPEAKER_01]: Garrido-Lecca of Toomey Genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tassa, Alfonso, how are you both doing
today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm really excited that you guys are
both here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were saying before the podcast
started, Tassa has done a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts for cannabis growers and cannabis
related content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and for our listeners as
well, this is going to be a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: a different show because normally we
interview growers, both like home grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growers to gain an insight into
their world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't usually have two doctors in
the house where you guys have an immense
[SPEAKER_01]: background in both genetics research and
cannabis research specifically and
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen prevention and testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have been told, Alfonso,
that you have also some experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation as a home grower and
at a research level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love for you to draw from that
experience to kind of be the grower in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation and Tassa, you know,
like I said before, you've been on
[SPEAKER_01]: numerous other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to kind of stay within that
vein of thought here as well to best serve
[SPEAKER_01]: the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, if we go off on a tangent,
I'm super happy to let the flow of the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation just carry us away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't plan on stopping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to spend the first part of the
show to gain a little background on both
[SPEAKER_01]: of you and how plants and science came
together for you, whether it started off
[SPEAKER_01]: with one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if your involvement in both sort of
developed in tandem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the second part of the show,
I want to talk about to me, genomics and
[SPEAKER_01]: how home growers and commercial
cultivators should be aware of pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they can best mitigate them and the
steps to take if they detect a pathogen in
[SPEAKER_01]: their grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with you, Tassa,
because I feel like I've heard so much
[SPEAKER_01]: about how you operate through to me,
but I don't really know about your
[SPEAKER_01]: background with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you have told this story before,
but when did you first become interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in plants or science?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it something that they kind of came
together in tandem, like I was saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I guess plants have been a big
part of my life for all of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up out in the country in Colorado
in a house with a big backyard and my
[SPEAKER_00]: father's a master gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent a lot of time in my childhood
just following him around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he taught me how to transplant plants
and how to see when they're sick,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to see when they have like diseases
and issues in the bark or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, obviously he also had a
huge collection of indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just kind of grew up around
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, that continues now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so gardening has always been something
that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love being outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the smell of the dirt and growing
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My cat's going to video bomb us here in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come here, cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, we're lovers of cats here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of pets, so we might get
video bombed at any moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and so, I mean, I've always
loved being outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved growing things and living things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also always loved science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been interested in the way the
world works, the way life works,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it works, why it works pretty much my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say I, you know, I got into
biology and science and high school,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking all of those courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went straight into it in
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just been something that's always
fascinated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I once I discovered research,
it was like I was home.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's like there's all these
questions that people don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just wonder, but for the first
time in my life, you could answer a
[SPEAKER_00]: question that nobody knew the answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for a short period of time,
you're the only person in the whole world
[SPEAKER_00]: that knows the answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like solving a big puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it was like exciting and it
was fun and it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oddly enough, I went into what is
called RNA biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically I studied the structure
of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like, it's like the
three-dimensional shape that molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that particular shape carries
information that tells the cell what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did my whole doctoral dissertation
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also did my postdoc on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we, moved into cannabis and
I'll let Alfonso tell the story because he
[SPEAKER_00]: has a lot, I think he started earlier with
cannabis than I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started looking into viroids and
viroids are three-dimensional RNAs that
[SPEAKER_00]: adopt a specific shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that shape that carries all of
the information about how they're treated
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cell and how they become
pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just felt like between the
plants, which I have always loved and
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering all of these pathogens,
which are terrible, but super fascinating
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just felt like the perfect combination
of things to sort of make a career and
[SPEAKER_00]: make one that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that it kind of coalesced
together because sometimes I feel like,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the cannabis community that
I participate heavily in, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation and people approaching this
plant as something that's really magical
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of like exceptional or special or
different than other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in so many ways, it's the exact same
as any other crop plant in that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: harbor pathogens, viroids, the movement of
these viroids and pathogens and pests are
[SPEAKER_01]: also kind of universally known and they
have been known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we try to separate this plant
from everything else that it's connected
[SPEAKER_01]: to within agriculture and horticulture,
we start to lose sight of some of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: well-understood methods of remedies that
we can take for a myriad of different
[SPEAKER_01]: problems that we might face as growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So applying the science while you are also
loving plants, it kind of opens up your
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes, I'm sure, as you've experienced to
where you can be like, well, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just take, I'll take this
information, kind of Frankenstein it up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit because I can use the
information that I have for this other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and just apply it right there and
look, boom, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is really cool to be kind of on the
cutting edge of something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're discovering new things that
you're like, oh my gosh, I can take this
[SPEAKER_01]: and apply it to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that feeling of discovery has got to
be tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's actually, it's been
incredibly cool in cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much that's unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right, there's a huge body of
literature and agriculture that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: lean on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is an amazing plant,
but it is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would maybe argue that maybe all
plants are kind of amazing in their own
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably a lot about them that
we don't appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis, you can read all of this
literature, but there's a lot that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really exciting to have a
grower be like, well, I just seeded this
[SPEAKER_00]: mom plant that has hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do with those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they gonna have it too?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know, let's do a
research study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just really fun to be in that
position where you can just be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, let's just set up a research study
with a grower or another lab and industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just so much to discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always an opportunity to
discover more cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fun place to be in the sense
there's so much unknown.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to get a little bit off topic
because of something that you said there,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to cannabis seeds,
I know that I believe I've heard either
[SPEAKER_01]: you say before or heard elsewhere that
it's like 90 or 95% potential if it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: female plant has hoplite and viroid that
the seeds will become infected with
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might have my numbers off there,
but I was curious, is this something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're finding on the seed coating?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it something that you're finding
within the germ plasma like the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer is both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower of for a cannabis flower for a
plant that's infected with hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid has an incredibly high level of
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's the it's the tissue that
accumulates the most viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, of course, would be the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the outside and even in that seed
coat, the chances of finding the viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking that seed and throwing it in a
tube, grinding it up and doing a PCR on it
[SPEAKER_00]: is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the plants, even 100% of
those seeds will test positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a difference, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't necessarily mean that if you
pop that seed, that the seedling will have
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done studies together showing that
the chances of the actual seedling having
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid vary between 20 to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that depends a little bit on the
cultivar and the level of infection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the father, if the pollen carries it
in, it's in our studies was much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 5% of those seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you say you have a packet of seeds
that all came from the same mother and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to know, did that mother have hoplite
and viroid sending that seed in one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: of those seeds and doing a PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the mother did have hoplite and viroid,
you'd be able to tell just by a few seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the chances of finding like that
are incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for indulging me on my
little tangent there, because I find that
[SPEAKER_01]: part really interesting as someone who
likes to pop cannabis seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, just one last question on
this first part for you, Tasa.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you first encounter cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it something that you encountered
already as a research scientist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you have some experience with it
prior?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great segue into talking to
Alfonso.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's the director of research and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also my husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mostly encountered cannabis and
growing of cannabis through Alfonso.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing it for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so probably we've been together for
about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the last 17 years or so,
but that introduction happened when I met
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfonso.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents, it was the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom introduced my dad to cannabis when
we moved out from the Midwest to the West
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's a story as old as time,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Alfonso, let's hear a little bit about
when you first became interested in plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and or science, you know, whichever came
first or if they came together in unison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear your plant story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I became interested in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can remember I was always into
the outdoors and plants just being around
[SPEAKER_02]: plants just make me happy, just gave me
like a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And times that I was not feeling good,
I could just sit around plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: forest and it would just like calm me down
and make me go through the ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I in science, I was as a kid,
I was had really ADHD to the extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't a very I was not a good
student in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that I will never become a
scientist or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interestingly, like when I tried
cannabis for the first time when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: around 17, 18, 18 years old, it gave me a
sense of I could just sit down and be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to read something that I have never
experienced before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of opened the door to the
academia and science, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I guess I moved to the United
States from Peru back in 1997.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was here and I decided to go
into graduate school, I found that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: just smoke a little bit and I was able to
read journal articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this like literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started consuming cannabis in
grad school very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually did my dissertation with
cannabis because I wasn't able to sit down
[SPEAKER_02]: for like eight months every single day and
write 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was kind of like intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was in that moment in which I was
always already growing in my basement
[SPEAKER_02]: since 2012, 2000 in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became like you will be able to grow
with your red card, with your medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: card, which I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was growing in my basement and I the
the the buds were incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was everybody was like, oh,
yeah, you can grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, it is just a plant that I
can grow any plant from whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was just a moment in time in
which everything went to hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything like it was just like no more
like resinous or sticky buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all like a fluffy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, OK, maybe the pH,
the nutrients, the media, the tent,
[SPEAKER_02]: the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then like for like four or five years.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that time, we to me started
and we actually started in doing COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we transition into cannabis,
we designed the PCR test and I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we can use my plants as a negative
control and they should be negative
[SPEAKER_02]: because right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then they were always positive and
they were like, oh, this test sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should like redesign it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe seeding something in the
cannabis plant is always positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody gave me a plant,
a little plant, a little clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used that one and boom, it was
negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I can't believe I was
dealing with hoplite and viral for the
[SPEAKER_02]: last four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, 2015 to 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so then that's how I realized,
man, there will be a lot of people there
[SPEAKER_02]: having the same problem as me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I cannot even imagine if I only had
four plants or five plants at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have like an entire facility
full for acres of cannabis, then this is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to really affect you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, so that's I became.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aware of like this virus could do to the
plant and to the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I in it kind of like interesting
parallel, because at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was writing my dissertation,
I was writing about an enzyme called RNA
[SPEAKER_02]: polymerase two, which my dissertation was
about like when the DNA has genes and this
[SPEAKER_02]: machine machinery needs to know where it
starts and where it ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if like, I think like five percent of
the DNA is coded by genes and the other
[SPEAKER_02]: part is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were interested in see how does the
machinery knows when to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was writing about this and hoplite
and viral it when it gets into the cell,
[SPEAKER_02]: it uses the same machinery to to copy
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I was dealing with hoplite and
viral, in my own grow without me knowing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was digging into this same machinery in
the literature and knowing all these
[SPEAKER_02]: things about this enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just curious to see that I was
dealing with this in my grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was probably at that moment I knew
the entire literature of that enzyme,
[SPEAKER_02]: which goes back 40 or 50 years of
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were able to kind of apply all of
that previous research to the current
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, which was the hoplite and viral
that you were facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but also at the same time,
there was is very little known about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is because the cell uses the machinery
to do something similar, but not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The viral is exploiting that to on its own
benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like what is intended to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that actually works in the favor of
the viral because it makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: mistakes when it's copying itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what the viral wants because he
wants to evolve and mutate and try to
[SPEAKER_02]: adapt to the different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why maybe people say and I
experienced it myself that when a plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: infected with hoplite and viral,
it's strain dependent on what you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to see and it may be that that's due to
the differences in mutations in the viral,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think are called quasi species or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's really fascinating because
I've seen a bunch of people deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: hoplite and viral and it just completely
wrecked their grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I've also seen people who just
not out clone it, but they they'll they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: keep, you know, vibrant new mothers for
their production and and replace them at a
[SPEAKER_01]: regular interval where they're not
building up a sort of sort of a threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: that then creates these devastating
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've even heard of people using things
like putting aspirin in their in their
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient feed because the acetaminophen
will will affect the rate at which the the
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid builds up in the tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that that's how that occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys know anything more about that
specifically, I'd love to hear your
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, the strain dependency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've we have actually done a study in
collaboration with State House in
[SPEAKER_00]: California where we took 12 different
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut clone from them from mothers that
were confirmed negative or hobbling viral
[SPEAKER_00]: and we infected them as clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we grew them throughout their
lifetime and we tested them every couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks and sort of followed the viral
infection and all these different 12
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really fascinating because we
found some that were incredibly sensitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they were super stunted, super messed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd lost a ton of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with those particular strains,
I think you'd be unlikely to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: out clone it or outgrow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even even if you took really,
really good care of those strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just so sensitive that they just
kind of like crapped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were others that seemed resistant,
like it was really difficult to get all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viroid load grew incredibly slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they were all positive at
the end of the study, most of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't see a huge drop in yield or THC
levels or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was one strain,
which I thought was kind of terrifying,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was super easy to infect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like skyrocketed viroid level instantly
and grew all the way to adulthood with
[SPEAKER_00]: zero impact at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like tolerant, which is great for
that strain, but it kind of functions
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat like a Trojan horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have that thing in your facility,
because you're like, oh, this thing looks
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to clone it and I'm just
not going to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like silently spreading it to
all of your other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain strains where I do
think that it would be possible to clone
[SPEAKER_00]: so frequently because the viroid,
it either is traveling very slowly or it's
[SPEAKER_00]: replicating slowly so that you're never
going to see a major impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does continue to be an infection risk
for the rest of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are doing that, it's important
to be aware that you're cloning plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are positive so that you can be
incredibly careful about touching your
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as adding aspirin, I think that
they're probably the ideas there is the
[SPEAKER_00]: salicylic acid, which is a plant hormone
that can sort of elicit the immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so adding that can, there is evidence
in the literature that it can slow viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the accumulation of viroid in some
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence isn't outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 8% or something, but it can
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm still a proponent of just
getting nice clean moms and testing to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you don't have it and just
preventing it in the beginning instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to treat it after the fact,
because that's incredibly hard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we could go over maybe a few
symptoms that growers might find where
[SPEAKER_01]: they might want to then be on the alert or
potentially start to look into getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants tested for hops late in viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we could go over kind of what you
might see in a vegetative stage of growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as what you would see in a
flowering stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I guess if you have any symptoms
to add, just throw them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So symptoms are incredibly variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see symptoms, some of the more
common ones with hop late in viroid are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the plant will get stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has kind of irregular growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally like the branches are going to
come off at like a 45 degree angle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with hop late in viroid, they tend to
come off horizontally, which makes them
[SPEAKER_00]: very brittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a plant and you like go
like this and all the branches break on
[SPEAKER_00]: the way down, that's really characteristic
of hop late in viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see leaf discoloration,
chlorosis, abnormal leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does affect the growth of the root
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the leaf size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves can be small, yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they are not like the big fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like little smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the root system also can be
affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have clones and they're just
rooting incredibly slowly and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have like any sort of environmental reason
to suspect that they dried out or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, sometimes that could be a sign
that the mom plant had hop late in viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of timeframes are you seeing on
the cloning process and that extension
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're mentioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a feel for the timeframes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes longer to root the sick ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like very strain dependent,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say like what I have seen,
like what has happened to me is like when
[SPEAKER_02]: the clone is infected with HOVD and
because I'm growing them, the infected
[SPEAKER_02]: ones and the non-infected ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if one day I forget to water them
because I was away or like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually all the leaves kind of like drop
and kind of like the plant feels sad,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you add water and it kind of like
recuperates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen that for the hop late in
viroid ones, they can't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, the majority of them,
they just die and the leaves become like
[SPEAKER_02]: dried up and crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's about a two X decrease
in root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes about twice as long for it to
get to that same place as a healthy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they don't make it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just don't see those really nice
white roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just depends a little bit on how
sick the mom was too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but for the bottom line,
it's like, it's very hard to figure it out
[SPEAKER_02]: just by eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably if you are, you've seen it a lot
and probably your eye is already used to
[SPEAKER_02]: it to identify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for that reason, I think it's good to
test and you don't have to test like a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to test smart, like at the
specific point, like you have to test,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before cutting the clones and then you
have to test the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of like building protocols and
SOPs so that you can't test in a smart way
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't have to spend that much
money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard test early and test often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have a pretty good
assurance that you don't have it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then just don't bring any genetics in that
you don't know where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also another thing is like if you,
like sometimes me, I want to smoke some
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find that the dispensary, you don't
have much money and you just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually those cheap weed that look like
little buds and stuff, maybe full hoplite
[SPEAKER_02]: and virate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you come and roll a joint and then
go and clean your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may pass it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is important to, I think,
like use gloves, especially if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: stoner and protect your clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very easy to pass it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How late have you tested dried flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how long after it has been dried has
hops late and virate been detectable and
[SPEAKER_01]: transmittable?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually haven't done those studies,
but Simir Poonja, Simon Fraser University
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada did a big study where he took
flower from dispensaries all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to space the percentage,
but it was like 70 to 80% of the flower he
[SPEAKER_00]: found over there was infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's incredibly common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's in a very,
very high level in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if the plant got that infection
later on and then it didn't impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower because it wasn't infected for very
long, the flower itself is still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroids in general can stay active for
about three months in dried tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually requires like kind of
rehydration and then it can become
[SPEAKER_00]: infectious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some studies say up to six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of depends on which viroid
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although those studies, like you were
saying, there's a lot of literature in
[SPEAKER_00]: other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not done in cannabis with hop
late and virate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, if you're getting weed,
grinded up weed all over you, just be real
[SPEAKER_00]: careful before you go in there and cuddle
with your plants because it's super easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to transmit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to be stuck with
years of frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a good point because I don't
feel like a lot of people would think
[SPEAKER_01]: about that, but it does make sense if you
are already seeing detection on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of seed shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's basically the same as the
dried flower at that point in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: what environment those those viroids are
facing outside of the living tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very, very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the flower morphology and
the other symptoms you might face or find
[SPEAKER_01]: in flowering cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, hop late and virate's
biggest impact is going to be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically the flowers that come out of
infected plants, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible ones are you're going to lose
a lot of density.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be more like the fluff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid content, both THC and CBD
go way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see the same type of trichoma
formation and they just don't produce as
[SPEAKER_00]: much terpenes and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're basically, you know,
like the disease, the nickname is their
[SPEAKER_00]: duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much it just it just tanks the
flower completely.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, are there are there any
cases that you've seen where the symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: only present in part of the flowering
plant or perhaps like one branch,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everything else is kind of looking as
you would expect it to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the important things to realize
about virates is they're they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like living things that have
the ability to move about the plant on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a plant gets infected,
like say you cut a branch and you cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a dirty tool and the virate gains
access, it has to move about the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with the photo assimilates, which is
basically the the the goo inside the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's transferring the energy of the sun
or the lights to areas of the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: can't make their own energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the virate is going to move from what's
called a source to a sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sink areas are areas that can't
make their own energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to go to, you know,
new growth that hasn't doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: capability to do photosynthesis yet,
or it'll go into the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there is no photosynthesis
going on there, which is why testing the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots is so useful because it it has to go
down there because that's it needs the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy from the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the bottom line is it's not going
to go to every branch, at least not right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes there can be a huge delay,
like two months or whatever, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what ends up happening is you can
see exactly what you described.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some branches are going to look super,
you know, infected and sick and the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other branches are going to look
just fine because the virate either hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: traveled there or hasn't been there long
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to build up enough of
a load to really impact the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, I lost my train of thought
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with with like the flowering cycles
then and you seeing it only in one branch
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially or across an entire canopy,
if the viral level is that high in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant, other than a decrease in
flower quality, maybe could you describe
[SPEAKER_01]: some of what you might have seen in some
of the plants that were more resistant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still with a reasonably high level of
viroid presence within the tissue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's so that's the sort of
trick that hoplite and viroid plays on all
[SPEAKER_00]: of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are somewhat resistant or
tolerant, you often don't see much of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can look across the canopy and
be like, everything looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to test whatever,
but it can look very asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's it's important to know what
the symptoms are to know that something
[SPEAKER_00]: might be percolating in there that you
need to test for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also important to realize that it
can exist asymptomatically and it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: important to confirm, especially if you're
bringing in new things, that it's not sick
[SPEAKER_00]: before you put it next to all your
important mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other really important observation we
made is that if plants test negative or
[SPEAKER_00]: have an incredibly low viroid load at the
kind of at the end of propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the two to three week time point,
even if they end up building a pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: load by the time they flower out,
we don't tend to see symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, you could have a plant
that accumulates viroid very slowly and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say you're vegging, you keep some
for veg or to replace your mom's and it
[SPEAKER_00]: builds up that load slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not see it in the first couple of
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe in the second or third
generation, all of a sudden, the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough of a load that when they go
into flower, it's affected the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that now you're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a sense, it can kind of sneak up
on you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, if you just keep a few moms
that are clean and you test them
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently and you can cut off those
moms and then they can be propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers, you don't have to like have
thousands, but that's the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect yourself because you can't rely on
the symptoms because you just might not
[SPEAKER_00]: see it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along the same sort of line with the
symptoms that you might associate with
[SPEAKER_01]: hopslate and viroid, are there any other
pathogens or viroids that can cause
[SPEAKER_01]: similar symptoms that may be less
pervasive but might be almost like a false
[SPEAKER_01]: positive if you're just trying to visually
identify what's going on in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to recognize that
symptoms like leaf discoloration and
[SPEAKER_00]: stunting are incredibly generic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a plethora of pathogens that
can cause things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just seeing those symptoms,
it's something that hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: should occur to you, but it's not
necessarily a given that that's what your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has.
[SPEAKER_00]: The collection of viroids and viruses that
impact cannabis is kind of understudied
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, so we don't know a lot about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few like alfalfa mosaic virus,
tobacco streak virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else would cause those symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's beet curly top virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have all been characterized in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are going to be more of a
concern if you're growing outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's all possible that it could be
caused by those types of things instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to add something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lettuce chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I feel like sometimes
there's a little bit of a dog whistle when
[SPEAKER_01]: you hear HLVD, people start to freak out
and they just think, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: every little symptom that I notice in my
garden where my plants don't look healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's got to be it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the world is coming to an end right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've even heard of kind of stories
where people have chucked out their entire
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic collection because they were
worried about one plant and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: realized they had been using the same
scissors or scalpel for the past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, of course I have
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to spend the money to
get it tested because the same money that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could spend on the tests in some
cases, you could just spend to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics back from a clean source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even nowadays, you can get them as
generation zero clones from tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: labs that are going to provide you a much
more secure way of acquiring genetics if
[SPEAKER_01]: they have all of the paperwork and
documents to match.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tissue culture is important to
know that it's not 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it is a very, you can imagine just
like what they're trying to isolate is a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of little cells that marry stems,
but the adjacent cells that are not the
[SPEAKER_02]: stem cells are right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're with a scalpel, it doesn't
matter how many times you've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just cut it a little bit,
the wrong part, everything will be
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tissue culture, even if you go
through tissue culture, those people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing tissue culture should check that
if the virus has been eradicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have heard although I have never
done it, but I have heard from people,
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders that they have been able to
outgrow the viral by just cutting the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoot, the epical shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say that they have to cut it
three, four, five times that sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like a very lengthy, more than a year
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were saying like, it's not worth
it, but you can imagine if that shoot
[SPEAKER_02]: grows because it grows pretty fast and you
haven't had the chance for the viral to
[SPEAKER_02]: get there and you cut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a chance to, I'll compete the
viral, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard the exact same stories from a
bunch of different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that does give a lot of
hope for what was called like two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, the potential supervillain of
the cannabis industry because people were
[SPEAKER_01]: losing entire rooms worth of yields out of
their facilities over the course of a
[SPEAKER_01]: given space of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could see, especially with kind of
the downturn that the cannabis market has
[SPEAKER_01]: been facing lately in terms of the price
per pound and the overhead cost and the
[SPEAKER_01]: operational cost, that all of them are
going in the wrong direction for there to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a decent profit margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something like this, where you
could say, look, I have this population of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and if they have hot plate and
thyroid, I can face a 50% yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's just say loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that alone would be devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not even be tenable at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm like, I'm really excited
to get this information out to people
[SPEAKER_01]: because I do feel as though where there is
a lot of potential for yield loss and crop
[SPEAKER_01]: failure even, there is also a lot of hope
for how you might be able to prevent it,
[SPEAKER_01]: combat it, as well as ameliorate those
issues overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we've gotten a little bit of
a good background now on both of your
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I want to kind of move into a
little bit more about Toomey Genomics and
[SPEAKER_01]: what you guys do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could both go over a little bit
about your roles at the company and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: any exciting projects that you're working
on currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I guess just a quick
background on Toomey Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a pathogen testing company as well
as a company that provides guidance and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do have an issue, we don't just
give you a test result and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of consulting and building
pathogen mitigation programs for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of as a side, when we founded
Toomey Genomics or we founded the company
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, we founded it with the concept
that we wanted to bring basically kick ass
[SPEAKER_00]: science or great science to industries or
geographies that are underserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the cannabis industry,
when we discovered it, it was exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: our company was founded to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our main focus at Toomey Genomics
is providing not just that testing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen mitigation and all of that,
but also the information and the research
[SPEAKER_00]: that people can rely on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done with the right controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that we can sort of start
chipping away at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation and the unanswered
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers have what they need to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you had brought up,
you know, like people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I'm screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole life is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to throw everything away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a lot of fear
around pathogens and cannabis in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially around hoplite and thyroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most important things for
me is for people to understand that with
[SPEAKER_00]: information, you can combat fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to feel like you have to
be terrified of this thing or it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to ruin your whole life or the world is
ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot you can do to protect your
facility or your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even a way we've helped people
who have like rampant infections,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of build up a clean stock or,
you know, sort of a genetic bank of very
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slowly over time, work through
moving the by right out of the facility
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to shut operations down and
lose a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's not, you know, whether you're a
home grower or you have a huge facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't always want to be like,
and now I'm just going to cut it off and
[SPEAKER_00]: have nothing, no flower at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, the whole, that's the whole
basis of this company is really to fight
[SPEAKER_00]: fear and to bring information to growers
so that they are empowered to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do something about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, the way we do that is
through research with academic industries,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as with industry, like cultivation
partners and things to sort of answer some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we test plant tissue for, you know,
our, the main three that are going to ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: your life are hoplite and virite,
fusarium and pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fusarium and pythium are mold or mold
like infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can tank your plants or your entire
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also test for a myriad of
other, you know, viruses and pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, are much less common.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the symptoms warrant it,
warrant it, that we can also test for all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things as well, as well as
providing pathogen mitigation programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you realize your facility has 30%
infection, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get on the phone with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll learn a lot about your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your practices, and then we'll
identify ways that you can correct the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, like a testing plan that's within
your budget so that you can start to work
[SPEAKER_00]: through it and, you know, kind of
correcting some of the cultural practices
[SPEAKER_00]: around sterility and, you know,
people movement and all of those things to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of make sure that, that it's cleared
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you have a pathogen, like a
fungal infection, we, we help people track
[SPEAKER_00]: those down so we can test your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your water, your air, your growing media,
kind of figure out where it's coming from,
[SPEAKER_00]: why it's happening to you, and then build
you a plan around that to sort of get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to think that we're a
complete scientific solution, that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: partners with growers and we help them
work through these issues and come out the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side clean and successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes just giving,
you know, like it's kind of the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between like leading the horse to water,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can, you can lead them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you just leave them there,
they may or may not drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you kind of show them that you can
drink the water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how you get through all of these
problems, you know, potentially if it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a pathogen or a viroid that you're
facing, that's such a, a huge benefit to
[SPEAKER_01]: add to the services that you guys are
providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is really hard to figure out
then what you do, especially if you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're already dealing with
flower rooms and, and environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters and irrigation maintenance and
oh, you got a drying room that you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: have trimmed and all this other stuff that
like the life of a grower is very hectic
[SPEAKER_01]: and can be very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to add then the extra stress on top
of it of something like a pathogen or a
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid, you know, it's, it's almost like
dealing with a pest infestation where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have this huge battle in front of you that
you see and you go, I just got to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: toughen up and buckle down and,
and get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like sometimes maybe the fear
of these different pathogens and phyroids
[SPEAKER_01]: is because you don't really see the damage
until it's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the path to fixing it is not as
easy as applying a pest spray where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pests are already such a big
problem that it's like the next level of
[SPEAKER_01]: hell is phyroids because you, you have so
much, it's so much is unknown to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grower in the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's, it's great that you guys
do provide sort of the whole holistic
[SPEAKER_01]: package for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfonso though, let's hear a little bit
more about your role with the company and
[SPEAKER_01]: any potentially exciting projects
considering you are the director of
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I developed all the test services that
we offer, but in particular, we are aware
[SPEAKER_02]: that the PCR technology is kind of like a
20th century technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been around for 50 or so years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are trying to move away from that
into a more 21st century science,
[SPEAKER_02]: technological tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we developed the, the to me globe for,
for, for growers to test in their,
[SPEAKER_02]: in their facility for hoplite and by
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's important because it is,
it costs the costs a lot because a PCR
[SPEAKER_02]: machine is 50 K and the reagents are
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time consuming, preparing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were trying to basically develop
something that will overcome all those
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did our to me glow and, and now I am
working on basically making, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the fusarium equivalent of the to me
glow so that growers in the grow can test
[SPEAKER_02]: for HOVD and per fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and probably I haven't started it yet,
but probably in the next year we will be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the same for Pythium and other
common diseases that you will find.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, there's, uh,
there's this technology called,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, next generation sequencing in which we
are, uh, trying to get into it because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's becoming with a year's super cheap to
just, instead of you asking me,
[SPEAKER_02]: does my plant has hoplite and by right,
you can ask, what does my plan has?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the NGS or next generation
sequencing will be able to tell you all
[SPEAKER_02]: the, all the pathogens that your plant may
have in that model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and, and the costs are like
super low compared to PCR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, is it something to do with like
having a, it has like a bank of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, references that it can use versus
having like, a direct reference of like
[SPEAKER_01]: having the, you know, the, the confirmed
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you take that and compare it
to the information.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what you do is just sequence the
entire, uh, nucleic acids, DNA or RNA of
[SPEAKER_02]: the, so you will get, uh, by, by,
by default, a bunch of the plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but then, uh, you can focus on the
pathogens, non plant, uh, sequences on,
[SPEAKER_02]: on, on line, uh, free there's,
uh, libraries, uh, databases of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, of all these pathogens and their
sequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you basically, uh, with a computer by
informatically, you can see, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: this sequence, which is repeated a hundred
thousand times in my sample, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go to this database and it
tells you, okay, this sequence is this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, um, uh, a better approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, than the old PCR technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you could even then kind of apply
some of these different AI learning models
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, kind of sift through that
information even faster and more
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this technology is, uh, going,
uh, advancing a very high pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, that's also just another
level of hope for the growers where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to allow for such a, a more
comprehensive testing, um, scenario for
[SPEAKER_01]: them where they're going to be able to
just find out that much more about their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and what they can then do to help
improve their grows overall or their
[SPEAKER_01]: yields, their health of the plants and all
those different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I bet you there's probably a lot of
other sort of combinations of pathogens or
[SPEAKER_01]: just little issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be something as simple as
applying like a, um, like an oxyposs or a
[SPEAKER_01]: zero tall or something like that to the,
to the plant and be able to kind of kill
[SPEAKER_01]: it off, take a new cutting, outgrow it,
outstrip it and, um, and be free of that
[SPEAKER_01]: potential issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, I, I like to do this
podcast for both home growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cultivators, because I feel
like there's a lot of information that can
[SPEAKER_01]: help both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but at different, in different ways in
a lot of, a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the services that you guys
provide both for home growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial, uh, growers, when should
people, uh, potentially look into getting
[SPEAKER_01]: testing done for their plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like what, I know we kind of went over
some of the signs and symptoms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, if you were to go to,
uh, say a new grower and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've heard of hop slate and viroid,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they know that they can get tested,
but they go, well, I don't, I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I should get a tested or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or as a commercial grower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not seeing yield loss or,
or anything, um, significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like, what, what are some of those
things that they should be aware of where
[SPEAKER_01]: they go, ah, I need to start looking into
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I guess my take on it is that
prevention is always going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faster and easier than, um, trying to
mitigate it once it's spread in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and often you don't see anything like
you were saying until it's gotten really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad and then fixing it becomes this thing
that feels very overwhelming and requires
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if, you know, if I were starting a
brand new grow and I was bringing in new
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, you know, the first thing I would
do is go to my clone provider and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, did you test these clones or did you
test the mother that you cut these clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, for ideally hoplite and
thyroid and fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause you don't want either of those
in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Pythium, um, can be not quite as bad,
but obviously you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing that in either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, confirming if you can,
that the clones you're purchasing are
[SPEAKER_00]: negative is step one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you already have mothers growing in
your facility, um, I would definitely do
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a baseline test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ideally the way people are organizing
their mothers is that they have,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the kind of depends on the size of
your facility and how many production
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers you need, but you have a smaller
subset of plants that are called,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, nuclear stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's say, you know, if you need 20
mothers of each strain, you have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: moms that are, um, uh, represent that
strain, but they're kept in a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: place, even if it's a separate table in
the corner and even if it's a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: table, you know, even if you're a home
grower and you have stuff going on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: basement, you have a little tent with,
you know, one or two of each strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: you like to grow that are protected,
that you keep the bugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very careful when you're handling
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those should be tested periodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, ideally you test them before
you cut clones off of them and you test
[SPEAKER_00]: the clone that will become the replacement
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, depending on the cadence
of how often you're replacing those,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and that's to make sure that nothing
sneaks in and sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is sneakily moving about your,
your basement or your huge facility until
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, basically kicks you in the
ass six months later and you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: this huge loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I guess the, the, the short answer,
that was a really long answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short answer is, um, I don't think
there's a time when you should like say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now I start testing this, it's a
continual thing that you do and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be thousands and thousands of
dollars, but it does need to be something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's worked into your regular process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because if you skip that and you work
without information, it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: ticking time bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know when things are going to go
south for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better to just prevent it at the
offset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was just going to say that in my
case, when I, since you were talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick, about the, how you sprout seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I have found that before sprouting
them, like sticking them into 10 to 20%
[SPEAKER_02]: bleach for one minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it is, is, is does, uh, it's important
because if the HOVD is in the outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: the coat, it will destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if any fungi, anything fungal like is
in the outside, it will also destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a, you know, it will just take
you one minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have not seen any, uh, decrease in
germination rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds are pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so yeah, so that's a good
practice to, to, to do before you
[SPEAKER_02]: sprouting your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, is the other product that you can
use, is it called, uh, Zircon or is it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, it's Vircon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zircon I think is an allergy medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not familiar to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why my mind went there,
but V and Z, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're at the end of the alphabet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same, same side of the alphabet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so Vircon is the other product that
people can use, um, also potentially by,
[SPEAKER_01]: for seed washes ahead of times,
just to give yourself that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: assurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when you're using the bleach on
the, uh, seed wash, do you recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: letting that bleach fully dry on the seed
coating after removing it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you rinse it with water?
[SPEAKER_02]: I rinse it with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sometimes, uh, like with
different chemical applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to allow it to like either fully
dry in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has the full effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rinse it with water, but I have,
uh, many times forgotten like stone and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, Oh, well, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they still do great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I feel like some people think that
bleach is the complete enemy of a grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in a lot of ways it's probably one of
your best friends to make sure that things
[SPEAKER_01]: stay clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the enemy of your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fashion enemy for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and even with things like,
um, hypochlorous acid, it still has the
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorine molecule in it so that it's,
uh, it'll test for on chlorine strips at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, you know, in the same way that
bleach would, but bleach just as that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, hypochlorous chloride rather than,
um, hypochlorous, which it seems to be as
[SPEAKER_01]: though the hypochlorous acid has a little
bit more of a gentler effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals, but, um, still makes the,
the surrounding sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately like sterile generally
means that you're killing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's usually fungus and bacteria,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's actually a lot of the
pathogens that you're going to need to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about, especially the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, viroids are weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they don't have, um, an outside
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any lipids or fats or
proteins associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just genetic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the stuff that will work to
decontaminate viroids is that the list is
[SPEAKER_00]: very tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's bleach, obviously,
which thankfully is super easy to find
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere and cheap and cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, you're diluting it one
to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one part bleach, nine parts water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were going to use it pretty slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or that VIRCON 2%, although I do like
to tell people it's only one study that
[SPEAKER_00]: that was shown to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean it's effective in all
viroids, but the, the doesn't have nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: as much data as bleach does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bleach has like, it's basically the
positive control in all studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if somebody wants to try something
new, they're like, well, bleach should
[SPEAKER_00]: work for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it work as well as bleach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, um, it, it's, it's important
to remember that that one is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for, um, for decontaminating
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always suggest a 10% bleach solution for
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that it is just, it is, it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I always tell people to make
sure that they're soaking their cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors in a 10% bleach solution and
making sure that they sit there for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're not like agitating them,
you know, vigorously, uh, and I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've learned that from you through
the, um, uh, we, the growers podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it was very informative, uh,
information that you gave people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and would you mind touching briefly on
why people shouldn't use alcohol to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, try to help prevent the spread of
viroids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so alcohol's, uh, mechanism of action
is going to be to, um, dehydrate proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, people use like isopropyl
alcohol and stuff, you know, like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hand sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that works fine for viruses,
um, and bacteria, although I'll be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't, it's not amazing, but it does
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the problem with viroids is because
they are just naked genetic information,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, nothing in the mechanism of action of
alcohol works at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and actually, um, alcohol stabilizes,
uh, genetic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so using alcohol actually will
stabilize viroids, um, and make it easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to infect the next plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there was one study where they,
I think this was using potato spindle
[SPEAKER_00]: tuber viroid, but it has the same
structure as hoplite and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they basically, uh, took the
infected scissors and dipped it in water
[SPEAKER_00]: and then cut the next plant and the
transmission rate was like 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they dipped it in water,
in alcohol, it went up to 90 to 95%
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you're actually, you're peddling
backwards by using alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't work at all on viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a flame doesn't even work on viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done that experiment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, little buggers, viroids there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a heat threshold for,
for, um, destruction of a viroid or can
[SPEAKER_01]: they withstand basically any heat that we
would be able to apply to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there is a heat threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was 140 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is in Fahrenheit,
but, um, it was like almost 300 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, they did do, for example,
a probe, a propane blowtorch that did not
[SPEAKER_00]: cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, they're very heat stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would, you know, bleach is so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cheap and it works like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I just recommend that to people
because I don't have investment in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this just works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well that's, that's great information
for people because I feel like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, a lot of people will just be
like, I have alcohol for my scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I use it to clean off all the gunk
when I'm trimming my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I'm just going to use that to
spray everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can it not be clean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it, it's very important to know
that it will help even spread the pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I believe I've even heard before
that it's used, uh, in like in vitro,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, reproduction of viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can use alcohol to kind of help
proliferate their spread, um, within the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, or maybe it was just that it
would spread easier if that applied to a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, alcohol is used frequently in
the lab, um, to help precipitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take, um, like genetic
information can actually become like a
[SPEAKER_00]: solid and you can precipitate it into like
a little like particulates at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and alcohol helps with that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it makes them very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, if you store them in alcohol in
the freezer, they're, they last much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than if you stored them in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why, that's why it helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: To transmit it because it makes them more
stable and it kind of helps them
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitate into these little
particulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It concentrates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, it's, it's, it's a no-go
for, for viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't replicate in the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, they require like,
like Alfonso was saying, they require that
[SPEAKER_00]: machine that exists inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually have to be in this,
in, in a living cell in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, I mean, we've talked about
bleach, we've talked about the Veer Khan,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and those are just kind of the
chemical ways of destroying or potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying the, um, the viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, are there any other practices that
home growers, um, might, might,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, use to help prevent, uh, pathogens or,
um, help, uh, prevent the spread and then
[SPEAKER_01]: also, uh, in that same line of thought,
uh, what are some of the treatments that
[SPEAKER_01]: people can use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I would recommend starting
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you bring something new into your
facility or, or into your basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you need to have a quarantine area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can just be the corner,
like underneath a lamp with a bench or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tent or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and make sure that you put that plant
there and it has separate set of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use gloves when you're messing with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, test that plant, um,
test it at the minimum for hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would test it for, for serium as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want, you can test for pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, um, those three are going to give
you misery if you find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do not put them next, like in the tent
with your favorite strains until you make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that that plant isn't infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, generally I would recommend two tests
about, uh, two to three weeks apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: just in case the viroid was at a very low
level in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this is just really important when
you're bringing in new genetics into a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where you know it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, while you're waiting, obviously you
want to be looking for bugs, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of weird discoloration,
any other funky symptoms that you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want my plants to have
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so just be, just be scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like to garden outside,
which I do, and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like things like Fusarium,
pythium, and other kinds of molds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, botrytis and all sorts of
nasty stuff is outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're coming into your grow in your
basement or in you into your facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to be aware that it could be on
your gardening clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be on the bottom of your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, just throw on, like if you just
get a lab coat or even, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: change your shoes out, like Mr. Rogers,
before you go down there, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not bringing stuff in,
um, to your facility or into your
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then as you're working with your
plants, when you, you have your gloves on
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're moving from plant to plant,
if you'd make a 10% bleach solution and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a little spray bottle,
then, you know, you can be like trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever with a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to put your scissors in the
10% bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spray some on your hands and rub it
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you shake it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to touch the plants with the 10%
bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That concentration isn't going to hurt
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's to just sort of clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you're not the big vector
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transferring it from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's important to remember the roots
have a very high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, um, your plants, especially if
there's water at the bottom of your tent
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're on a table and there's runoff,
they're elevated a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots aren't sitting in that runoff
water because you can transfer it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it goes for fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and remember things like clonal trays,
or if you want to do a flood and drain or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, that's another big
transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Risk for, um, hoplite and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, um, obviously insects,
there's just information coming out right
[SPEAKER_00]: now from CSU showing that, um,
uh, I believe it was aphids they found,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of any insect that's going to
chew up and get on the sap, like on their
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth parts or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go to another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could transfer it like that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or pets.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats, my cats like to chew on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, there's not any data out there,
but I can just see if my cat is chewing on
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaf and then it's going to chew on
the other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another thing that I seen that
happens, although there's no data to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but one time we had like a plant which was
negative and a plant that was positive
[SPEAKER_02]: right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were using it to test, um,
just as our controls for the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we noticed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day they got a fungus net and all of a
sudden the, the negative plant was
[SPEAKER_02]: positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fungus net has this, uh,
stage in which there, when, when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: before flying, they, they, they live in
the soil and they feed on the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, think like a way for the
viral to, to get wings and just fly to the
[SPEAKER_02]: other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it be transmitted with root
aphids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, any, anything like that, I mean,
unless they're producing some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical in their body, that's going to
destroy the viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as we previously discussed,
there's not a lot of those chemicals that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can even use in a lab setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I, it's doubtful that the bugs
are producing chlorine in their bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I, I've heard that before
that, um, uh, pathogen pressures can
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely increase with, uh, pest
pressures because of the, the transmit
[SPEAKER_01]: ability through the, the, the pests being
the vector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see, are there, are there any
other vectors that you, that you feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: growers should be aware of that,
um, we may not have touched on yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the mechanical is going to be the most
common way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, seed, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you should definitely be testing
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and like I said, one seed from a seed
packet, if they'll, if all those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the same mother is sufficient
really to determine whether or not they're
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, insects are definitely a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water transmission is real and there's
plenty of data to support that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to be thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, roots touch each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have things super,
super close together and the roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: like kissing, that's a possibility too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same with the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the foliage is really close,
as long as there's no breakage,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, where there's like sap transfer
between two, like wounds or micro wounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you're okay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and Alfonso was saying,
um, you know, other, other things you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think about, like your pets,
your cats, um, and, and anything you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it in from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that weeds are vectors too,
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes, and it does, it is in the pollen
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, be careful with that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a question about the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is there any potential for it to be
released through the moisture that the,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the stomata are sort of, uh,
transpiring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that, you know,
sometimes you get the leaves that will
[SPEAKER_01]: overlap, let's say from two plants that
are next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you pull them apart, it'll be a
nice wet layer on both the top and the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the leaf that we're touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, that's not necessarily a wound,
but it could be considered like a transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: of fluids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is there any potential there for the,
uh, the viroid to transfer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no evidence that it can
transfer, um, like, you know, with
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration byproducts or whatever for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's mostly going to be
contained, you know, within the cells of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and in the sap, which is kind of
how it travels around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, but if there's little cuts on
both of those leaves and we're not talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about like, you know, half the leaf is
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really like microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sufficient to transfer it between
those two leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's just prepping people for,
uh, being able to look at this stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: an educated eye, I feel like is so
important because, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've now kind of busted one of my own
myths that I had, uh, heard where it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't necessarily need to have like the
sap, like the phloem or the xylem
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it could just be like a contact
transfer, which, um, that's really good to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear that that's not necessarily a,
an easy way for that to occur,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so keeping plants elevated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea, especially for drain
tables where in facilities, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of, um, times where I've seen,
you know, based on the construction of
[SPEAKER_01]: those, uh, drain tables, there may be a
dip in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it does build up a little water,
but it's not too much to where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: creating like, um, hypoxic environments
within the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just, you know, giving them a
little bit extra water compared to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants that are on that table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they're still using it up,
but it is then at that point transferring
[SPEAKER_01]: between three or four plants or something
that are in that, that dip in the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will say one of the biggest,
I think details that a lot of growers miss
[SPEAKER_00]: is, um, the rooting gel when people are
cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of times they'll dip that clone,
they're super careful about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll cut clones and everybody
gets dipped in the same shot glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, a hundred plants,
same shot glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that is a gaping wound,
a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dip it in that shot glass and it
becomes like a little hoplite and byword
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're basically inoculating every
single clone as you go through your
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so be really careful, like thinking
like that, like, what am I sharing between
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there, you know, either something
that comes in contact with the roots or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like clonal gel that I'm sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I'm really careful,
I'm, I'm infecting all of these clones by
[SPEAKER_00]: using the same gel for each clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing media is the same issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had one grower submit their growing
media that they were reusing the cocoa and
[SPEAKER_00]: it tested positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I would recommend not reusing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do choose to reuse it, you should
sterilize it again, 10% bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd probably give it a good 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, uh, to kill off anything else
that might be in there and then rinse it
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, yeah, reusing stuff between
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pots, tools, growing media, everything can
transfer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this plant is doesn't look healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to compost it, but that's like
the worst you could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then reusing it on the healthy ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a great, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've heard them in like living soil
bed systems that that's also one of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of the death, death touches
to those beds is if you have obsolete
[SPEAKER_01]: enviroid, because typically you're leaving
some level of root mass behind when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, um, transplanting with new plants
for another cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, are there any ways to potentially kill
off the Viroid in living soil beds or
[SPEAKER_01]: other, um, substrates that are reused?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause I know that sometimes that can
be a significant investment for even a
[SPEAKER_01]: home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if they're doing like a small four by
four or two by four fabric bed and they
[SPEAKER_01]: buy all this soil to fill it, or they
spend all this time to create their own
[SPEAKER_01]: soil at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any potentially, are there any
ways that you can potentially remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: Viroid from the soil?
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I've had this conversation with
lots of growers that have this really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome living soil that they've been,
they've had for years and they've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really wonderful and rich,
but unfortunately any treatment that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to remove the Viroid is going to
destroy everything that you love about
[SPEAKER_00]: your living soil in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so what about leaving it untouched for
like a year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I mean, I don't, the studies on
what, how long, I think it's six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can let it sit for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd be, I'd be wary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd want to test it just to be sure before
you reuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, honestly, the best way to
protect your living soil is don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't plant anything in there until
you test it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, don't, don't go backwards and be
like, Oh, I've planted something positive
[SPEAKER_00]: in my living soil and that this was so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like put it in quarantine, test it,
twice and then put it in your living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you don't have to worry about
it because it's not positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the best way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, in my mind, I'm thinking,
even if you let it sit for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, if there's any root mass left,
then there's still potential for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Viroid to replicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the six month mark is probably
after the last replication occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have food for it,
basically in there for, a couple years,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're still looking at like a couple
years plus six months at that point for it
[SPEAKER_01]: to potentially be, um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's even a little pocket of
other, uh, biological material in there
[SPEAKER_01]: that it can latch onto and continue to
proliferate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, are there other, sorry, are there
other biological tissues that it could
[SPEAKER_01]: latch onto to continue to replicate itself
other than, um, plant, plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so, so it can't, it's not going
to be able to replicate in dead tissue per
[SPEAKER_00]: se, um, because it actually, it requires a
living cell and it has to go, it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the special place in the cell
called the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the tissue is dead, dead,
it's not going to be replicating
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have to remember though,
it's not alive, like the way we think of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a fungus or something being alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's almost like a toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's, if it's there, it just hangs
out waiting to be rehydrated and uptook by
[SPEAKER_00]: a living cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just does its thing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so really what you're fighting is how
stable is this, how much viral it is in my
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil and how long do I have to wait
until it actually degrades?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the answers to all of those
questions aren't known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the one thing that has been shown for
a viroid similar to hoplite and viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: called hop stunt viroid is that it can be
taken up by fungal pathogens and
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated inside of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, if there's like Fusarium or maybe,
I mean, we don't know all the pathogens or
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that this could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could even be like, you know,
endophytes or, or, you know, other types
[SPEAKER_00]: of living things in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may take up the viroid and keep it
replicating until you plant new things in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's really one of those things
like, you know, you're living soil makes
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants really awesome and you've
worked very difficult on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's something in there that is
just going to make everything tank,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's not worth keeping because,
you know, you get, you have it because
[SPEAKER_00]: they make your plants successful,
but keeping the soil at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's infected works the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess it's like, um, if,
uh, you know, if you, you invested all
[SPEAKER_01]: this time into it, typically, a lot of
people when they've had, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a living soil bed for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that investment might not
necessarily be worth, uh, the pains that
[SPEAKER_01]: you will then face from hop late and fire
oyster or Fusarium or something along
[SPEAKER_01]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that, you know, it's, it's kind of
one of those tough answers that I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like people do need to hear that it,
it might just not be worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no matter how much time you let
it sit there, there's, there's potentials
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, opportunities for it to be an
issue in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, like I said, it's that's,
that's a tough one though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could only imagine having a whole
facility go down, you know, a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: light room all in living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's one of those really hard things
to, to mitigate, you know, and Fusarium is
[SPEAKER_00]: worse, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It in, out in the field, the spores can
last like three to five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in like a, a more protected
environment, it's, they can last up to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, it's just not something that
you want to mess with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I did not know that they could last
10 years in an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is frightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, you know, I mean,
hop late environment is an insidious
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can sneak into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread everywhere, but,
um, Fusarium is, it's devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if it really takes hold, it kills
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can kill an entire room in like a week
and the plants are just dead and then melt
[SPEAKER_01]: into the table.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it's, it gets in the water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets the growing media and it can go
airborne.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're just looking at,
you know, like a nuclear option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to test for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want that to be in your
facility or your basement, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, I mean, that's not awesome,
but it's awesome for people to know that
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, uh, can be more devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's, it's kind of the
unspoken viroid that a lot of people are a
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen that people don't really talk
about too much because when it does
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, it is just kind of like,
well, I guess the game's over at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, um, you know, we did touch briefly
on tissue culture before, uh, and how that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be an option to help, uh, either
potentially remove, uh, viroids or other
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but are there any other, uh,
points on tissue culture that you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like people should be aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you want to take that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, specifically, especially like
remembering that it's not a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: percent, that it doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it could, it could be expensive,
uh, to do that if you have several
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics strains that you have to clean
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but also it does, it does work in the,
you know, other crops, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, protected, like in similar to in grown
in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they, they use it successfully there
and, uh, but I'm sure that it is attached
[SPEAKER_02]: to a testing protocol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the tissue culture has to be
tested for sure to know that the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the culturing of those cells was
successful without any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do, I do like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of practices within tissue
culture that, um, within aseptic technique
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of allow for you to help
mitigate the transfer of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like even within, like, let's say you
have something in tissue culture that does
[SPEAKER_01]: carry a pathogen with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you have a lot more fail safes and,
uh, and stops in place to help prevent the
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer of it to other, uh, tissue
culture that you're working with at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you can prove that you have no
pathogen or viroid in that, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: in that plant tissue, then you can
proliferate it from that small amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant matter into a much larger population
to then help, um, provide that genetic uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar to other people, um, in a very
safe way, as long as it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not entering a facility that already has a
bunch of these problems and isn't going
[SPEAKER_01]: through some sort of quarantine phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, I, I think that tissue culture has
a lot of potential, uh, at least,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially within pathogen prevention and,
um, remediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, this has been a wonderful
conversation guys, and I feel like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we, we've gotten a lot of information
out there to people that they can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: make actionable within their own gardens,
which is very important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I do like to kind of wrap these
up, uh, as a cannabis podcast with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more cannabis focused
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do either of you currently use cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I tend to be more the edible type,
but, um, Oh, well, I mean, edibles are
[SPEAKER_01]: still, you know, uh, a form of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, but, um, you know,
I, as someone who is also a user of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, I feel like there's a lot of,
there's still a lot of stigma within the
[SPEAKER_01]: professional world of people using
cannabis and incorporating it into their
[SPEAKER_01]: professional lives successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, Alfonso, like even with what you
said earlier, it was almost cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed you to, um, develop all these
different skills because you were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: finally sit down and open a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, how the attention span,
uh, the stigma, uh, the society has
[SPEAKER_02]: created that if you smoke cannabis,
you, you, you must be lazy or unproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: or unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's a misunderstanding and
that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just probably something that came out
in the dark ages to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: bring down cannabis and.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these manipulations that the
government has done or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, um, I think it's so important
to show that, uh, professionals,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of your caliber, both of you
being doctors are pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I feel like,
uh, it opens up the door to more people
[SPEAKER_01]: who want to enter the different STEM
fields, but might think that their passion
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis or, um, you know,
other other elicits, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: magic mushrooms, for example, and how many
potential, uh, benefits there are to the
[SPEAKER_01]: different alkaloid components within
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and, and then with cannabis,
you know, people think that that's their
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier to entry, that that's what they
want to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or that they want to make sure that
that's continuing to be incorporated in
[SPEAKER_01]: their life, whether it be through a
medical application or a recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no one tests you if.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drank alcohol the night before when
you come into work the next day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that can be devastating for a heavy
workload.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to come in and be more fuzzy
and hazy and, uh, with less ability to do
[SPEAKER_01]: things than if you smoked a nice joint the
night before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to add that cannabis
research is, is in infancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if smoking cannabis does not give you
this effect that it doesn't make you like
[SPEAKER_02]: productive or it, it takes you the other
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe cannabis is not for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different diseases out there that
are coming out that are potentially death
[SPEAKER_02]: threatening that, that people are not
aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, it's just depending on
your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody is get affected by it
because as we all know, we, we are,
[SPEAKER_02]: our cells are covered in these receptors
for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be that your genetic makeup
is not conducive to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should be aware of that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's even things like the
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, where that can be devastating to
someone's entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it is all as far as we know it up
to this point, cannabis induced and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, related.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just like with anything else in
life, some people have a tolerance for it
[SPEAKER_01]: and some people don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people can, you know,
some people can be functioning alcoholics
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and do amazing work while completely,
uh, you know, at the bottom of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so it, it is very much
independent, uh, or subjective in a sense
[SPEAKER_01]: where you need to make sure that you can
handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful and be smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying to the people that want to use
cannabis and, and in, in, in, in,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, or wanna, or wanna follow what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like what my life experience was
like that, but I do have friends that is
[SPEAKER_02]: the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to learn to listen to your
body and what is it telling you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because cannabis is also, you know,
it's not a, it's not an aspirin and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not, um, like a typical pharmaceutical
where there is one component, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: active ingredient that's going to have a
very universal response across most humans
[SPEAKER_01]: where cannabis, you know, it has different
terpene profiles, different cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles, uh, other volatile organic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and all of those kind of play
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, can cause vastly different
responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of why so many people say,
you know, they love cannabis because
[SPEAKER_01]: variety is the spice of life and they can
have a huge variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences all from technically the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just different, different genetic
expressions within that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I think that that's a very
good point to bring up that it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a universal, uh, you know,
we, we should, we shouldn't put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: good, bad dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it, it is, uh, very much, uh,
very much subjective and everyone can have
[SPEAKER_01]: a unique experience using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, just a couple more
questions for you guys, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and take this one in whichever way
you want, uh, Alfonso, you, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: having grown cannabis and Tassa,
you having researched plenty of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but is there a favorite cultivar that
either of you have encountered either,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, through research where maybe it is
just, you know, it, it never catches hops
[SPEAKER_01]: late in fire or it never has an issue if
it does have it, or maybe through the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth characteristics of how it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if there's something that you find
extremely, uh, favorable for your own
[SPEAKER_01]: desires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I, I, I prefer the old school,
what the people call the old school
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like Northern lights, number five or
AK 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my favorite, but, but recently,
not that long ago, I brought, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: some seeds, um, from back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some, some land races that grow in the
mountains of Peru.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of, um, similar to having a
glass of wine is not like very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very potent, like in the THC kind of
probably, probably one-to-one THC CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably one of those things, uh,
very mellow and very, uh, active.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you, you want to do things,
you, you want to get the next thing done,
[SPEAKER_02]: the next thing done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I really like, uh, like land
races is strengths.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the flowering time is like 95
days or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, I, I'm not a very, I don't like
the strains that are high in, in THC or I
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer that the, the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, no, I think that it has a lot of
benefit for people, especially when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: find like a true one-to-one, uh,
THC CBD, those tend to work really well
[SPEAKER_01]: for people that have like high anxiety or,
um, you know, their attention span might
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be, you know, tweaked in one way
or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I feel like those always tend to work
fairly well for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you, you know, you can never
really find a 95 day cultivar on the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial market because you can't charge
more for something that you grow longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, and so it then becomes that much
more expensive to create that final
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always say for home growers,
they should absolutely treat that as a,
as a, as a, as a, as a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why people like to try
growing out, um, something that's like an
[SPEAKER_01]: equatorial strain because they will never
experience that to its fullest potential
[SPEAKER_01]: unless they grow it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, and so Tassa, um,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, your, your favorite cultivar to
smoke, um, I don't have as many cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: in my pocket as Alfonso here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't know anyone that has as
many cultivars in this pocket as him,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, um, I tend to favor the ones
grown outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read any of that literature and
I don't stand like why that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or what the scientific basis of it is,
but, um, um, they tend to make me less
[SPEAKER_00]: anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I also prefer the ones where
there's a little bit less THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, and then the, you know,
I take gummies sometimes, um, if like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like my brain is spinning at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they've actually been like
game-changing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, if you take a Benadryl or
something the next day, it's like somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: hit you in the head with a two by four for
like hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, you can take a gummy
and, um, the next day you just fall
[SPEAKER_00]: asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next day you wake up and you're
just feeling good and you're ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, to me it's,
it's phenomenal that there's a stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: around that because it's just so much more
gentle, um, and effective than all the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that you could get at the doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, oh, I can't fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you know, here's an ambient
and you're just, I can't remember what I
[SPEAKER_00]: did last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, from the science side,
um, I remember all of the strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do remember one specific one called
motorhead, um, that we had an incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult time infecting with hoplite and
viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it, it built a level super
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, I think we inoculated 15
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something like two of them had a very,
very low, almost undetectable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took entire flowering, um,
timeframe in order for it to build up
[SPEAKER_00]: enough by road, you know, for it to be
like a reasonable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, from the science side,
like that one was a pretty good one when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to resist or yes, to resistance,
um, tolerance Illuminati tended to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would, it got infected like that and
built up a super high load, but it did not
[SPEAKER_00]: show any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that would be your, your Trojan horse
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will qualify that with that was that
specific motorhead and that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: Illuminati.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, you could go and get
by those strains and they may behave
[SPEAKER_00]: completely differently because,
um, they have the same name, but
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically they're not, you know,
the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of, I feel like,
uh, confusion through the way that seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: are marketed within the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so usually when I refer to like a
single plant, I'll refer to it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar, like with, uh, normal
agriculture and, um, then a seed would be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, a genetics right there or,
or a cross or a, uh, um, a strain perhaps,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if you want to go down that path,
but, um, yeah, I feel like that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's good information to have people,
you know, it, the fact that there are the
[SPEAKER_01]: abilities for plants to completely almost
like ignore the fact that the viral is
[SPEAKER_01]: even present and, uh, uptakeable by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be, Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm don't really care to have that
whatever mechanism of action it is that's
[SPEAKER_01]: causing it to not be uptook.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just very special in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the fact that you can have a
ridiculously high threshold of viral or
[SPEAKER_01]: viral presence within the tissue and that
it just doesn't even affect the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: time or the, the yield or.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the final product that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it's a very, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a place of super
interesting research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you could figure out the gene or
genes that keep the viral that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are involved in transmitting it
around the plant, like the transport or
[SPEAKER_00]: the replication, then, you know,
maybe you can breathe that in to the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that you like, and just kind of
create a bunch of resistant things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely something that,
you know, if I had, like clones of myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be doing those experiments all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last question for both of you,
uh, what is your most memorable cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: related experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it be something in the lab or even
a personal use experience or otherwise,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, that's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, I figured it would be
kind of one of the harder questions that I
[SPEAKER_01]: asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe you can start, I can think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I mean, I guess, you know,
I honestly, like from the lab standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most, the most memorable one was
after, you know, two months of
[SPEAKER_00]: frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be like, wow, I've designed hundreds
of PCRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's wrong with me realizing that
the plants we have at home are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we can't get the test to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the weed sucked for so many
years was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, pretty, pretty memorable from a
science standpoint, um, and kind of cool
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense, cause you're like,
oh my God, how many people are struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same problem we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no idea that this was even there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and then from a personal
standpoint, you know, I guess I w I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of those people that Alfonso
cautions about when it comes to smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, um, I definitely can't have a big
joint and go to the lab that I would maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have fun, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart would come out of me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and there's definitely
strains that I have to be careful with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cause I get, you know, anxious or
freak out or, you know, so those are,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're not good ones per se,
but, um, um, but I, you know, did the
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery of edibles and being able to
fall asleep at night when I'm feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: anxious and just having that just,
I mean, get like the medicinal,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't get high or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fall asleep and then the next day
is pleasant for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's been a huge thing for me in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'm, I'm glad to be alive at a
time when I could use that legally to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I don't have a specific thing
that I could remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I do like, uh, the social aspect
of cannabis that, um, uh, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: matter if you talk English or whatever
language or whatever background or race or
[SPEAKER_02]: religion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are just smoking a joint together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, um, it's kind of like feels
connected and you share things and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know if something like brings,
uh, makes you humble and, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: listen, listening and understanding other
opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, uh, the social aspect
for me is something big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sharing, uh, a joint or something is a
great equalizer, um, across all different
[SPEAKER_01]: barriers that you might face otherwise,
um, social or economic or status based,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you light up a nice joint and
people smell it and, uh, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out and smoke, it's, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you like smoking and you get to
know this person and where they coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from their experiences and.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is equality for, you know, for,
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, guys, this has been a
wonderful, uh, conversation, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tessa Alphonso.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you go both are probably
extremely busy, um, with how many
[SPEAKER_01]: different grows and operations you must be
serving at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, this has been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, this, this podcast,
uh, it is designed to help people learn
[SPEAKER_01]: new processes, uh, or help perfect other
processes that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like we've provided a lot of
information today that will allow them to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a look at, uh, some of the,
the cultural practices of their grow
[SPEAKER_01]: operation and potentially prevent massive
issues from arising in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as, you know, maybe take that
first step and get some of their plants
[SPEAKER_01]: tested that they haven't been doing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of been putting off because of,
uh, financial or, uh, stubbornness or
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, this has been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having us on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, getting this information
out there, uh, like I like to say is how
[SPEAKER_01]: we grow the community and that's the way
we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
