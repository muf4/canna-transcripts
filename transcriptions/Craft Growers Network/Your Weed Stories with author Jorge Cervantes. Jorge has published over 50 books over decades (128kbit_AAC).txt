[SPEAKER_02]: 11 11 languages 11 languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And so like I said, he's inspired
more people around the world to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis than anyone that I know We're so
happy to have him on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome Jorge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Gee, see Gabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, you know, I mean we've
known each other For a heck of a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we use I used to have a house in
California in Sonoma, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: close to will it's it's not that far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's and I was just watching the
the interview with Kevin Jodri Hello,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's great He's done so much good stuff
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean when he started that Wonderland
nursery Dang that I mean that was that was
[SPEAKER_01]: great But see he's one of the guys and one
of the things he said in his interview was
[SPEAKER_01]: was his timing was good Because he got
into it publicly at the perfect time You
[SPEAKER_01]: know and For me my timing was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into it when it was like About as
illegal as you could get you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured It was gonna be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean I would I I wrote the
first book there in 1983 and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a full-blown drug war going on or
war on drugs going on but that might have
[SPEAKER_01]: added to the popularity of the book uh No,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I would see The problem is you
couldn't get into the the big distributors
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to hit that we didn't want to
carry it And then within no time I got on
[SPEAKER_01]: the theft list Because least theft theft
steal as in take away something that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason because Then they'd have to
lock the books up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to lock them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people were intimidated They were
afraid to go buy books.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they stole them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they steal them It was it was
faster easier and you know They risk
[SPEAKER_01]: getting caught there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I was on the the the theft list
for for Barnes and Noble and and Borders
[SPEAKER_01]: and got all of the big stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and Yeah, so that was pretty tough
and then you know, I mean I had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble people didn't want to well
printers just didn't want to print it I I
[SPEAKER_01]: had a heck of a hard time finding a
printer and The first book actually I
[SPEAKER_01]: printed it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I printed with these hands I didn't have
any money either, you know, nobody want
[SPEAKER_01]: take any chances and I remember what was
it and or press that was one of the one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the companies I send it submitted a
manuscript to he's they said over there
[SPEAKER_01]: that everything that is Everything that
needs to be written about cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: already been written and that was Pretty
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just scratching the surface now
Yeah, so anyway, I mean the book was
[SPEAKER_01]: rejected rejected nobody wanted it they
said was a dumb idea and all of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: So I printed it myself and self published
it in that way I was I was good for timing
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's when self publishing
started I bought a K Pro computer a cake a
[SPEAKER_01]: K Pro computer and was able to do
typesetting and everything And then it was
[SPEAKER_01]: it was tons of work tons of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was pre-internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking you can go to my website or
Jorge Gion Jorge- Cervantes calm what came
[SPEAKER_01]: down is calm and you can see you can see
my history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Pretty pretty complete actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the last few books on there
I've that I've written but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I published more than 50 books 50 books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I didn't realize I'd published that many
Yeah, I love this photo over here with the
[SPEAKER_01]: fake dreadlocks That's pretty pretty funny
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, so what I wanted to do if you're
willing to humor us is I wanted to start
[SPEAKER_02]: off as early as we can so for instance
like your first experiences with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, and you you may have to ask,
you know qualifying questions and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: because so when when was the first time
you saw cannabis when was the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: you smoked cannabis and You know
eventually we'll get to the first time you
[SPEAKER_02]: grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I saw I saw the leaf and stuff
because see I grew up in a small town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh agricultural town Ontario, Oregon and
it's right on the border with Idaho and
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody lives out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean They're they're all farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's a farmer, you know,
that's the main main occupation and or
[SPEAKER_01]: having to do with farming and so it's very
very conservative and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was all of those gosh I graduated
high school in 1972 and I think the first
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time I smoked it cannabis was 71
when I was a junior in high school Because
[SPEAKER_01]: number one it was hard to get it wasn't
real common to see yeah 1971 and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd heard all kinds of horrid things about
it everybody was There's a big anti
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis program anti anti pot program
anti marijuana program Going on in it and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was in the schools and Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean I couldn't I couldn't wait to
try it and So what happened one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends scored a three finger Mexican lid
that Mexican dirt weed I mean you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: from Europe don't know about that stuff,
but it's it's like the but I why you or
[SPEAKER_01]: something This is like really bad
Actually, we know about it because we
[SPEAKER_07]: really yeah, we have a similar thing in
Europe, which was the Albanian Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, there was a certain place that I
know this was the same thing like you had
[SPEAKER_07]: with The Mexican I think you know,
yeah Very very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the Albanian is Actually,
yeah, it's um, you know because of the
[SPEAKER_07]: same It was so bad, you know, it was all
see that it was bricks inside from from
[SPEAKER_07]: roofs You know to make it heavier like
yeah, it smelled like fuel gas I mean real
[SPEAKER_01]: because they transported it in these
trucks, you know We didn't have so much
[SPEAKER_01]: fuel smell but we had But we put rocks in
the kilos it put rocks in there and also
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocks and I remember I found all kinds as
I my favorite was lizards Lizards there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always lizards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd always find lizards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'd be always be running And
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but we bought An ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: of that it was like $10 us, you know cheap
and half of it was stems and seeds and So
[SPEAKER_01]: we all went out in my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was four of us We'd taken a pipe
from my tobacco pipe from my father And
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's no head shops nothing,
you know, and so we we all get in the car
[SPEAKER_01]: and start smoking cannabis, you know start
passing this around and finally toward the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the end of the The ounce I got
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean seriously high and it was great It
was nothing like anybody had ever
[SPEAKER_01]: explained to me or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was it was fucking wonderful I
couldn't get enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was driving the car and it was
like I was in the movie I was in a movie
[SPEAKER_01]: watching myself drive a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first major hallucination I had
and it was I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it and Yeah, that was Well that
that's what hooked me right there And then
[SPEAKER_01]: there was there was a lot of things that
happened then too because For example
[SPEAKER_01]: people adults that I respected They would
just buy into the drug war or war on drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: and and They wouldn't ask any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just believe everything they just
swallow everything And so what happens was
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought now look if you guys are dumb
enough to just believe something that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody tells you Well, I can't really go
along with that and I like to do my own
[SPEAKER_01]: homework And so I do my homework and I
find out that all the information comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from you know, like the anti-drug agency
So I think huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so What's the truth what's what's
going on and so I figured the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: were that were saying the same things as
as everybody else, you know the What do
[SPEAKER_01]: you call them the anti-drug guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys were just sheep and they'll
follow anybody so heck with them I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: really trust them and then the people that
don't that do their homework They're only
[SPEAKER_01]: reading one thing you got to read
everybody you got a little Look at
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and so I've just figured I was
getting bad news bad bad bad information
[SPEAKER_01]: straight away and So I never bought into
that drug war and I never believed any of
[SPEAKER_01]: it I just I mean because it was pretty
straightforward is a way to control people
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's it yeah, so I Yeah,
and Then after that that was in high
[SPEAKER_01]: school and then for university I went I
well, I spent a year here in Spain and and
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple other places but but the sec but
I spent another year in Mexico I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico and that's when we got really like
a really into it because the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: happens was all the the director the
director of the university gives us A big
[SPEAKER_01]: speech and everything about cannabis and
how bad it is and stuff and this guy says
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go smoke a joint He walks right
through like right in front of everybody I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought well, that sounds like a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go go with him and The next I
mean, I I've been a I've been in Mexico
[SPEAKER_01]: like 48 hours, you know And then the next
day, that's what I got my about my first
[SPEAKER_01]: kilo Kilo there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that you were gonna say the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got thrown out of school No,
no, they wouldn't throw you out of school
[SPEAKER_01]: you had to get You had to get you had to
be really bad to get thrown out of school
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I mean maybe No, I don't know
anybody that was thrown out nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown out They just look at things
differently there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so I got really into it there
and Stayed with it and then when I got I
[SPEAKER_01]: graduated University and I mean I'll be
darned I didn't know what the hell else to
[SPEAKER_01]: do except to start growing So that's what
I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that's why I did for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually I had a garden business I
moved to Santa Barbara, California and had
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden business and Then I grew
part-time Up in the hills and stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: then did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was first year that was Let's see It's
still in the 70s mid 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah mid 70s, but I grew for a couple
years made it make quite a bit of money
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I got in the bought a Volkswagen
van and Moved and then took a road trip
[SPEAKER_01]: went to South America in the in the
Volkswagen and that was well that was it
[SPEAKER_01]: was okay until you got to say in Central
America because oh Shit, that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're Los Andistas the Sandistas
from El Salvador was this Sandistas or
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandinistas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandinista Sandinista Sandinista.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're saying Anita.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're yeah, so I need that one,
but when they They were around and I met
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys that said They were driving
through driving through their Central
[SPEAKER_01]: America and the Sandinista stop them and
they requisitioned their vehicle They just
[SPEAKER_01]: took it off of them basically and they
gave him a receipt So you can have it back
[SPEAKER_01]: after the war.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Yeah, exactly So I thought that was
kind of a bad idea to continue there and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I I sold the car in America and then
went to got on the airplane and went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Chile because my partner my business
partner had already already gone down
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but my goal was to Well to do a lot
of traveling but To learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in South America and I just I was
Gone about six months and we just just
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much other stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I mean just kind of goofed off
for For the better part of six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I guess no actually I think I made it
more close closer to a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right Yeah, cuz I wound up in the
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right Yeah, but anyway when I When
I got back Back to the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: before you talk about the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you make it out here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Argentina no that Argentina Argentina I
didn't go and I didn't I went I go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Chile and Bolivia Peru I didn't go to
Ecuador And then Colombia I didn't go to
[SPEAKER_01]: until later till I spent quite a bit of
time in Colombia here the last few well
[SPEAKER_01]: not Not the last couple years,
but about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent spent quite quite Some time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you came back to the US Yeah,
yeah back to the US and man I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything changed it was it was rough
that I mean that's what you remember camp
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign against marijuana planting in
Northern, California Mm-hmm where see the
[SPEAKER_01]: big problem was with this it was it's a
freaking drug War or when the camps start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I don't remember the year I'm bad with
all because I thought camp was a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit later than like some of your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, yeah, definitely later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite a bit later late 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Because that's Tom Alexander used to
I didn't want to skip over the Tom
[SPEAKER_02]: Alexander part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why Yeah, anyway, go ahead talk
about camp Yeah No, anyway, I'd moved No,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started I started growing there and then
let's see, but yeah, basically and then
[SPEAKER_01]: gosh I moved to Yeah moved to Portland,
Oregon and that's where I wrote the first
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana horticulture book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was this before or after you were
involved in sense Amelia tips No,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was before what I did is I I I wrote
the marijuana horticulture or the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana horticulture I called it then
because The only thing you could get a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold of was Steve Murphy's or Murphy
Stevens's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm Yeah, and There was a couple of
yeah a couple others, but they were pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: lightweight and because there wasn't much
information so Yeah This one this one
[SPEAKER_01]: that's and and then the halide lights were
all new and they've gone from mercury
[SPEAKER_01]: lamps to halide lights and that was in the
early 70s and that's when all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: started and there was just tons of really
bad information people just They didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't have a fucking clue of what
was going on Most some things never
[SPEAKER_02]: change, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, you know, I mean there's so
many there's so much information now and
[SPEAKER_01]: That well, there's just not that much or
there wasn't that much at all so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: when I decided to do the do the research
and see I've I've been gardening my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: life and I had the garden business for a
couple of years and even though I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a degree and in horticulture or or a
hard science even soil biology I Know a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot about gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just you know hands-on so what
I did is I went to all of the the lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: companies so let's see there was a
Sylvania and Phillips were the two big
[SPEAKER_01]: ones and Got all of their literature and
found out everything I could and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: put the two things together information
about lights and then information about
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening and then you know, I'd been
growing I grown for by that time about
[SPEAKER_01]: about five years and so I put all of that
information together and then For me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you the smartest thing I did
back then was this was to Put a survey in
[SPEAKER_01]: there a ten word survey Or I mean a ten
question survey and ask ask people What
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean it and and then so I was
able to tailor the book for the for the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers Yeah, but where was that survey
published?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did people see the survey right in the
book?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right in the first book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm still looking over here,
man Maybe I put it in an envelope or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay I'll take a photo off of your of
your website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna okay I'm gonna take a few photos
off your website including you with
[SPEAKER_02]: dreadlocks sure Sure, no worries Hey,
I want to quickly introduce you to wolf.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also a co-host.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has his own show in our network as well
and Hey, he's really busy today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he couldn't join us on time but like I
said everybody wanted to have an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to Be involved in it and like
I said to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Thank you so much for joining us Yeah,
no worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way you asked in your book you put a
survey in Yeah to ask what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I remember Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the survey served a couple of
purposes one is to find out what the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience wanted and Two to find out how
what their knowledge level is and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean the like when you give a
Lecture when you talk to talk to people
[SPEAKER_01]: you just generally ask them what they know
So, you know how to speak to them so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can speak at this level proper level and I
remember the last question on the survey
[SPEAKER_01]: was did you a Thief or a policeman harvest
your crop And you know there's quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about security and stuff There but yeah,
yeah, that was all old times tough times
[SPEAKER_01]: My family thought I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Had to have two sets of friends people
that knew people that didn't I felt Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was pretty hard on the edge,
you know going against the entire world
[SPEAKER_01]: like that I kept people on my side or You
know found people that were on my side,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the to legalize cannabis But man,
yeah, it was just hard times a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sleepless nights a lot of times being
paranoid You know and like I said and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew for a few years so it was I Had to
sell it, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: company there was one guy this listen to
this There was one guy that shows up at my
[SPEAKER_01]: house I wrote a letter to the editor in
the Oregonian and from that People got a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold of my address and came to my house
two different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah This one guy shows up he shows up
He's got a pickup truck and it's covered
[SPEAKER_01]: with a tarp, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what he had done is he hit he read
the book grown old Grown about a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: kid ton of dope Harvested it all put it in
his truck and came over to my house figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what to do with it Was it all wet
still?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was all wet It was like parked
right in front of my house Anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this guy showed up to your house with a
truckload full of fresh cannabis that he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know what to do with yeah about a
Ton and he says well, where can I sell
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even want to look at it yet now I
looked at it through the window and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like hanging out the tarp and stuff and
now I mean now that's pretty That would
[SPEAKER_01]: have been a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole town would have known about
Portland's about half a million people
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been that that would have
been bad news God just all little little
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you know What was another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Guy that came over and I'm sure he was a
narc because he wanted me he wanted me to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell him some cannabis or Tell him where
he could find some But those were the
[SPEAKER_01]: those were the two ones that I recall
Yeah, but a lot of a lot of other things
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was a member the the Publishers
Association well several of them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: northwest and People just hated me like
some people like me but but half of them
[SPEAKER_01]: just fucking hated me Just before they'd
seen me or anything and they would blame
[SPEAKER_01]: me blame me for their children's problems
and and You know, you got to be careful
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're they're like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in public, you know, cuz they're
pretty upset But one time I did say I
[SPEAKER_01]: ain't the kid's dad You better look in the
mirror motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had it, you know I'm still curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did they like find you like on the
street?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have a photo of yourself in your
original book?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you not in Cognito later ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, they they came to my house
You said two people showed up to your
[SPEAKER_02]: house But then you said that like people
on the street would see you and blame you
[SPEAKER_02]: for their kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh No, no, no on the street not on the
street in the public Publishers group in
[SPEAKER_01]: the publishers group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's where they because because I
was very very careful with the identity
[SPEAKER_01]: that was Now that's a kiss of death,
man You could you couldn't travel anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: if you you know, you have a felony you
start running into trouble with traveling
[SPEAKER_01]: and especially if you want to move and It
comes up every time well Shows up every
[SPEAKER_01]: time you cross the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go into the little room And you
have the conversation about ten different
[SPEAKER_01]: times With the same with different people
and it's it's real unpleasant Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then let's see after that after that
Hydro farm got a hold of me and they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted me to put a catalog in the back of
the book So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a catalog in the back of the book
and we sold indoor garden equipment And
[SPEAKER_02]: now worked really well This is the same
hydro farm that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes the one I didn't know that part of
this Because later on they became well,
[SPEAKER_02]: San Rafael was diamond lights,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was they started But Francis
Drake Drake Boulevard, that's what they
[SPEAKER_02]: became so paranoid about weed later on You
know, so yeah They got popped in Green
[SPEAKER_01]: Merchant Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were one of the what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 106 stores or something that I don't can't
I got the stats here But one of the I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know 80 stores 40 stores I can't
remember they got they got pop but I did
[SPEAKER_01]: 120 and my friends went to jail I know
that that's why they made the change to to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a little bit more careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess yeah, they were Real paranoid for
a while, but you know, it's under
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your livelihood and you know,
you could go to jail Jail's not fun Like
[SPEAKER_03]: you said people did go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lots of them lots of them so there
was there was that and then after that
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and and then about a year after that
I opened a a garden store in Portland,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and That went that went pretty well
But I was said I'm really a shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: business person when it comes down to it
so I had a manager there that was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: dishonest and He pretty much ran me into
bankruptcy By not paying attention to this
[SPEAKER_01]: that another thing blah blah blah So that
that was pretty rough, but I do remember
[SPEAKER_01]: before Before Green Merchant I remember On
two separate well, no three four five five
[SPEAKER_01]: or six occasions two different narcs came
in I remember them very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably well, they're older now,
but I could probably IDM still Because so
[SPEAKER_02]: you said you had a garden store,
but yes, like what we would call a grow
[SPEAKER_02]: shop that was Yeah, selling here for
cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't selling begonias and ferns
Yeah, I sold some shade plants indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: plants we had a greenhouse yeah,
we we sold other things sold a few Or your
[SPEAKER_02]: focus in your head at least was 100%
cannabis or should I say tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the name of the growth store?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Northwest yeah Northwest Garden Center
Northwest Garden Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what year was this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that was Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I wrote that down That was Early
early seven or early early eighties early
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties Let me see if I can find a copy
of my this straight book Okay Now what I
[SPEAKER_01]: what I did what I did Here this is this is
the newest edition of this book the
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana marijuana horticulture,
but um, I took this book this book here
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanitized it and made this book Some of
the photos in that book are from my shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right That's right All power
printed in China, but yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are from your shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I well that's you were taking product
pictures At my store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah exactly You still owe me a check This
but but this book did did quite well
[SPEAKER_01]: actually Because it was For the employees
the employees could read it and know what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do Know how to help help clients and
then clients could read it and have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea And it gave people something to talk
about, you know different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes except, you know that The funny
thing is you know cannabis has got some
[SPEAKER_01]: really unique characteristics like some of
them well, but yeah exactly as yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Diocese big deal big deal and it's also
It's a short day plant you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it it flowers There's only a few okay
like poinsettias poinsettias Napa
[SPEAKER_01]: cabbages, you know, the Chinese cabbage
they call them also and Let's see
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are in cockle birth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of plants that are short
day plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: so You kind of have to I'm glad the cops
didn't read these things because yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean If you read this I Mean you baby
really things you'd have to know a little
[SPEAKER_02]: something about marijuana to know that in
the first place, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, so even if they read it,
they probably wouldn't have a clue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it like talk about flipping your
tomatoes to 1212?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have to change I have to change I
have to change plants for that but You
[SPEAKER_01]: know not a lot of people grow poinsettias
They'll get them in the winter and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: them for Christmas, but that's it but
Anyway, anyway, so so this one did really
[SPEAKER_01]: well did really well and but I get these
phone calls or not phone calls,
[SPEAKER_01]: but letters letters and Later,
I would get emails that would say hey
[SPEAKER_01]: Jorge There's this guy named George Van
Patten and he's been ripping off your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff you better You know, I mean there's
a big copyright violation there and I
[SPEAKER_01]: write back as all that's so bad blah blah
blah But it was a good joke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had a fun time with it You know,
it's funny about that Jorge is I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to a Friend of mine the other day
and we were talking about you and You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, he called I don't know if he called
you George because we're actually talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about Bill Ross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, yeah Ross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and so Ross always called you George
Yeah, you know and yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known you for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still don't know what your fucking name
is You still that guy with the sunglasses
[SPEAKER_02]: and dreadlocks as far as I'm concerned
Yeah We can keep it that way if you want I
[SPEAKER_02]: just wanted you to know that I thought it
was funny Actually, most people keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way that because you know my given
name George Van Patten What is your given
[SPEAKER_02]: name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now now now the facts are out that your
name Yeah, George, but I kind of thought
[SPEAKER_01]: that Avantis might not be your last name,
but Yeah, well Yeah Yeah Cervantes no Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I was talking about guard gardening
indoors and then and then later later came
[SPEAKER_01]: a green merchant Green merchant were you
around for green merchants or I was not I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually started growing right after
greener merchant So like yeah when I met
[SPEAKER_02]: when I met Bill he was super paranoid
Because you know they had just come to him
[SPEAKER_02]: His place and and give him a whole bunch
of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we talk about green merchant I
think one step like I said, I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to forget talking about somebody that I
know is you know dear to the two of us is
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Alexander and You were involved in
sense Amelia tips, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Actually, yeah, I mean and Michael
Siegel says hello as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: He recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he recorded with us as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh cool Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the thing is with Well given named
Tom Alexander, I always call him Alex
[SPEAKER_01]: because well, that's what I call him But
anyway, yeah, we spent we spent a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time together lots of time together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would go to the the national book
fairs, you know and we were always like
[SPEAKER_01]: the the crazies the crazies of the book
group because they're see we were in small
[SPEAKER_01]: press and small press back then they were
growing really fast and they were quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a Force to be reckoned with and we
had our own well, yeah small press and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just small smaller presses but a lot
of leftists and a lot of alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: people and stuff that we will hang out
with and then we will also have the party
[SPEAKER_01]: suite We would pull all our money get it
and and and get a suite Alex and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: do that we get a suite and then we'd all
always bring lots of dough We were quite
[SPEAKER_01]: popular quite popular everybody everybody
would show up at the at the suite,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Usually get I don't know anywhere from
30 to 70 or 80 people Ken Kesey showed up
[SPEAKER_01]: one time That was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a hit But yeah fun time and
anyway We spent all kinds of time we went
[SPEAKER_01]: to to that trade shows probably for 20
years 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and now it was rough times because
there's a bunch of people that hated us
[SPEAKER_01]: and and But most of people liked us
because the book world is pretty pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: liberal Even you know librarians
everybody, you know, you think it'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: very conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not at all conservative I think
people should be able to express
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we spent tons of time together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved out here from Connecticut from
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and Stayed at the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, he'd be a good idea a good guy to
interview It's already in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he stayed at the farm, which was Ken
Kesey's Stephen Gaskin, you know Excuse
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Asked you if it was Ken Kesey's farm No,
no, Ken Kesey was in Eugene, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Oh What's what's his name Gaskin
Stephen Gaskin and he was in Tennessee and
[SPEAKER_01]: they called it the farm Yeah, it was
biggest commune at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys are still there Yeah,
yeah, one of my employees is like part of
[SPEAKER_02]: that family and he actually or one of my
ex-employees He actually Like I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was like five or ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went back so that they're still there
Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I because Stephen Stephen
passed away like Five six seven years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I know he went back there like ten
years ago that you know, I Don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened if he had to leave because if
they closed because he died or something
[SPEAKER_02]: But they definitely just did ten years ago
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cuz I knew I knew Stephen from from
the high times he would go to Go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: high times fair the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the biggest thing happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, and then way back way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was this was early on Right after I
published the book For not within six
[SPEAKER_01]: months six months a year Neville was
selling seeds out of the seed bank in out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Netherlands and he's already Set up
the the cannabis castle and stuff So I
[SPEAKER_01]: spent a lot of time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would fly over to Netherlands regularly
Three or four times see well Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: three or four times four times a year
probably for about five or six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah That was early on early on And I also
held Neville Get some different cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds like What was it you brought him
genetics from the US?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't bring them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured since I was not I Was not making
any money I will put people together,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not gonna traffic anything Because
that's the way you well, you can't write
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't write you can't share any
information You got to stay able to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Yeah, so What did what did we get?
[SPEAKER_01]: the G 13 and one of the Afghan is because
there's basically four for genotypes of
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani and Big bud big bud was the other
one Yeah, and you know big bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a main breeder a main breeder
now When they changed all the names and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff Yeah, and that's when I spoke the
the haze for the first time and it's Was
[SPEAKER_01]: my favorite and it still is I love haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the absolute best Yeah, but over
there God and it was really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: the castle because what he did he that
Neville did And he passed away God four
[SPEAKER_01]: years now Four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was yeah, he's going to Australia Yeah,
um, but anyway, he had started Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what he he he made a lot of money Dealing
hash and that's when he got into the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding because he knew how to breed
canaries He learned all about breeding in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia when he and that is you guys
really really smart Really smart good
[SPEAKER_01]: science background, too And he goes He
goes and he buys over a nine Megan,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is right next to Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes and buys Right on the wall river
right on This great big old house and they
[SPEAKER_01]: used to call it the the big the big house
by the dike that's right across the river
[SPEAKER_01]: from nine Megan and then and then Because
and the house was but from about 1820s 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah 1810 1820 so all those old houses
have a big stable down below the the The
[SPEAKER_01]: basement is usually a stable for the the
horses to stay So what he did is he made
[SPEAKER_01]: in the different stables?
[SPEAKER_01]: He made different breeding rooms and then
he got a jackhammer and and made ditches
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere on the floor Jack hammered up
the concrete so he made a maze of ditches
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a low place where he put a sump
pump so he would and then he then he got
[SPEAKER_01]: the the rock wall the the slabs cut him
into short pieces and Then got a seal a
[SPEAKER_01]: meal to cover him with plastic So he would
have these little pots like this this you
[SPEAKER_01]: know this this high of grow down Rock wall
and then that way he could move these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants all over the place But it was very
very efficient real simple, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very very quite quite Dutch Yeah,
but actually Neville's from from Australia
[SPEAKER_01]: he left Australia because he had a Get a
legal problem Legal problems seem like we
[SPEAKER_01]: all get legal problems sometimes Yeah,
but I spent tons of time with him and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was a real education great times great
times We spent a lot of time in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: back then that was the only place you
could go and then I remember I went back
[SPEAKER_01]: to Went back to high times there was one
of the writers that was working for high
[SPEAKER_01]: times I won't mention but there was going
to Netherlands all the time and he said
[SPEAKER_01]: that He said that Neville wouldn't talk to
anybody but him I thought well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of sounds funny so So I
thought I call him up on the phone because
[SPEAKER_01]: his phone number was in the high times I
call it called Neville up and I Start
[SPEAKER_01]: asking him questions and he says yeah
mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on over hang out so that's what I did
I went over and hung out and Now learn
[SPEAKER_01]: learn tons tons from him fact there's
photos photos from the From his from his
[SPEAKER_01]: original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well cannabis castle in my books Yeah,

[SPEAKER_01]: you know The old days the old days It's

[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I mean I say that I can't I can't

[SPEAKER_02]: How do you have that beautiful hair?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, oh, yeah, I got lucky bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look what's happened to me When I met you
my hair was down to my rear and Now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know like We got to get some pictures
of Gabby with long hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good idea Gabby that uh those dreads
that you had That pictures the best this
[SPEAKER_02]: is gonna have to be the the like cover
shot of our video right here, I love that
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see I did those I came up with those
because because of High times high times
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted me to shoot because I'd moved up to
oh Hell I forgot about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved up to BC Canada and was living in
Langley, which is right just right out or
[SPEAKER_01]: not Langley, but The hell's the name of
that town?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's just the first suburb on on the
highway south of South of Vancouver I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: think of a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was up there a couple of years or
not quite two years and Yeah, that was not
[SPEAKER_01]: a real education up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when everybody was growing up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when Was that the 90s,
I don't know it all blends together after
[SPEAKER_01]: a while Yeah, I spent yeah, but anyway we
we high times wanted to do a video And so
[SPEAKER_01]: we shot the first video up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh What he said want this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimate grow here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it right here There was three of
them look at this one That's the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But I did ultimately I did three
videos with high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Wow, and yeah, yeah, but these were the
only And then they pirated these all over
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube And that was really a good deal
Because that's got me out or my name out
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the world Yeah, but the reason I
came up with that disguised was so I could
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot this video and People wouldn't see
my face Because like I say it was still
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty spooky spooky times back then But
Canada everything was wide open,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so that was You know quite quite
different But yeah up there, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant met went over and hung out one
night at the Hells Angels Hells Angels
[SPEAKER_01]: Clubhouse yeah, that was kind of a trip
and the angels are real big up there and
[SPEAKER_01]: then Yeah, did Oh lot of stuff lots of
stuff I Guess it's so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not incriminating But anyway,
it's just some stuff like isn't well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know I tell the story because I
promise you that law enforcement doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: care anymore They don't well, that's
that's good No, I'm trying not well No,
[SPEAKER_01]: I never never smuggled back And forth
across the border knowingly, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be in the state Moving loads and
stuff not like that move them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm moving inside the US that was like
normal I do in the god the 70s early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Mid 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was so Mid to late 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was moving loads up and down the coast
All the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what was your closest call?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Breaking down on the highway breaking
down in you know, I had a Volkswagen bus
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was sleeping in it it's a car broke
down I was sleeping in it and the cop came
[SPEAKER_01]: by to ask me if I was okay And that was
that was pretty close How much do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think I forgot about growing another time
when I was growing in in When you in Santa
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara upside San Ysidro Canyon It's just
south of Santa Barbara in Montecito What
[SPEAKER_01]: it happened I had a Plandestine garden up
there and was Growing there was a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a pump and everything I had to go up
there early in the day and and Pump water
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff is because nobody you know,
nobody should be able to hear it You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want a pump going off in the out
in the middle of nowhere And one time
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody the the Forest Service he'd lost
somebody got lost up there and there were
[SPEAKER_01]: they were reporting them and they thought
I was the lost guy Yeah So I was coming
[SPEAKER_01]: back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bunch of dope on me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm coming back down this trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everything's cool And the next
thing I know this is damn helicopter over
[SPEAKER_01]: me and they're following stuff So,
you know, I mean I could see I could see a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy look at me It's not good Probably no,
you know, I mean because it's easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, everybody's paranoid so or I was
paranoid and anyway, what happened was I
[SPEAKER_01]: Had I hid I went and hid under a oh there
was a big rock and I went and hid get all
[SPEAKER_01]: my dope and everything and stuff and then
And then I come down And then I walked out
[SPEAKER_01]: and I meet these guys from the Forest
Service and I thought okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is it You know, I mean I better
Better be real casual here and They asked
[SPEAKER_01]: me if I'd seen anybody if I'd seen anybody
else up there Because and that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out they were looking for somebody
else not me and that was that was spooky
[SPEAKER_02]: though because I didn't know any different
but they were gonna go near your garden
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like Like while they're looking for
this guy they could have stumbled across
[SPEAKER_02]: where you were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been hard It would have been
yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have taken some effort Yeah,
it would have taken some effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I had several layers of security for
sure Yeah, yeah several layers but anyway
[SPEAKER_01]: that that worked really well and that that
actually the second crop was the second
[SPEAKER_01]: crop I pulled out of there it was great
because Because that's when the price went
[SPEAKER_01]: from five hundred dollars a pound to
twelve fifty to twelve hundred dollars a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound and Yeah from one year to the next,
you know, that's my Double right two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half times as much as oh, so I did you
know what year that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what year that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy Eight Seventy eight seventy nine
seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: What sort of what sort of layers of
security were you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I do is is So if you put
duct tape on the bottom of your shoes So
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't match you with the shoes They
can't match you with the footprints and
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't say it with you and you have to
take it off every time so you gotta have
[SPEAKER_01]: that duct tape on you, which is kind of a
little iffy that and then Another thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take the branches and well first
you have to find a sunny location and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to find a place where you can
pull the branches over the cannabis so it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't look like there's a square cut out
of the out of the brush there and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's and and yeah, and so you have to
plant plant plants in several different
[SPEAKER_01]: places and In order to water it might
take, you know 20 minutes to water just
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to walk several places
Yeah, so but that that was the security I
[SPEAKER_01]: tried Setting up a camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have anything decent back then
it would have been crazy and then I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know You could only you'd had to develop
the film But those those were the main
[SPEAKER_01]: things and then the other security thing
was was doing Doing everything I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to I had to haul up there,
you know PVC pipe You know cut it in ten
[SPEAKER_01]: foot sections and you know, you look
pretty conspicuous White pipes,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and Hose a pump pump that was that
was that was heavy Were you like pulling
[SPEAKER_05]: water from an like a nearby stream or
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a San Ysidro Creek and
Fortunately it ran it runs all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it does still but it did
back then yeah, but anyway, that's That's
[SPEAKER_01]: uh time passed time passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people just don't don't realize
How difficult things were back there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then where what did we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I do next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see here Well one thing I can say
while you're looking for the next phase in
[SPEAKER_02]: your life was I thought it was really
funny that you said that you were really
[SPEAKER_02]: paranoid and and you know something that I
wanted to bring up is that Paranoia is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that people always said yeah
when I But I wonder if that's just because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the illegality of it, right Like people
don't don't get paranoid when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: drinking a beer, you know because it's not
illegal You know, so like 18 or 17 and
[SPEAKER_05]: drinking a beer at a party and the cops
show up
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I don't think weed makes you
paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the illegality of it makes you
paranoid Well, I don't know I'd argue that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's social aspects to it too,
you know, like there's been times where
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Hanging all the friends get super
stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh my god, like are they
talking show me like what the hell they're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about Like you start spiraling out
and yeah, but I mean, I think you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that when you're straight I think you are
you know what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually paranoid and it has
nothing to do with the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: For like 20 years so, you know Light of
hallucinations and stuff you could It may
[SPEAKER_01]: have something to do with I so I remember
one time Well, like for example those
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch guys, for example, they never get
paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never get paranoid when they're
growing when they're around it and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: because It doesn't have the same penalties
That is that it does in or didn't that had
[SPEAKER_01]: in America but nobody that I knew ever got
paranoid and There one time though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, uh Who was it Alan Alan
drunkers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben's son, you know from sensei seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm He said yeah, I heard about this
paranoia and stuff and he said it almost
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to me one time I felt a little
bit and then He said he goes I just spoke
[SPEAKER_02]: another joint went away Next time cosmic
take that advice if you get paranoid just
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke another Actually, you know The the
thing is that in Slovenia, for example now
[SPEAKER_07]: is still illegal the the cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's so much used now in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's so much easy smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said in one podcast that it's the most
tolerant country to call cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_07]: world maybe right now, you know because it
It's been yeah, it's been used also for
[SPEAKER_07]: not only for recreational but also for
medical Well people make this rick simpson
[SPEAKER_07]: oil for many years now, you know So it
doesn't matter what kind of perspective on
[SPEAKER_07]: life you have when you have a garden which
many people do they grow cannabis and They
[SPEAKER_07]: never smoked a joint, you know,
but they grow it and they make oils from
[SPEAKER_07]: that, you know and You know, it's like a
movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a big big part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also why it will be legalized maybe
soon maybe also because us will maybe go
[SPEAKER_07]: federal maybe Germany now because it
started to legalize or decriminalize it,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know So it's but you thought you hit
the the point when you said that the Dutch
[SPEAKER_07]: guys never get so Paranoid we because the
penalties in Europe for this was not Big
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't go to jail Just growing few
plants, you know, it's Yeah, no,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's never gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like no way.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it would be it would be But that's how
actually my theory is that cannabis craft
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis breeding is much more in USA
Developed because of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did not have this access We could get
seeds from Holland very very easily,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because we're in Europe,
but you had this border You know between
[SPEAKER_07]: us and Europe had this really,
you know DAA searched all the you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: they had a system.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean It's a very very very different
perspective, you know, but we still have
[SPEAKER_07]: illegal illegal a lot of illegality You
know many states are still illegal in many
[SPEAKER_07]: countries in Europe are illegal Like I
know you live in Spain, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, can you tell a little bit how you
decided to move to Spain or when?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe if I'm not jumping too far
No Just excuse me I want oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I spent a year here when I was
in in university I went to university in
[SPEAKER_01]: Valencia and Which is the third largest
city and in Spain so on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mediterranean and that was I was in the
early 70s and so I would I Had more
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom here than I did in my own hometown
And it's always that always stuck with me
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I moved here, I've been here
about 25 Yeah, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back then California was the only place
so it was legal 98, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Or 96 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember it Anyway, uh Yeah here
here it's It's tolerated it's Tolerated
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like a little overwhelming a
lot of people moved here from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe to start growing Which is kind of a
problem Because the Albanians are here
[SPEAKER_01]: now, it's a big problem because they have
like a pretty Those guys are the roughest
[SPEAKER_01]: mafia there is in the world I'm convinced
but yeah, because I met with the police
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff to find out how we can work
together They said no We can't work
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to help me at all and We
couldn't get pictures to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get pictures with them or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But um Yeah, the thing is here we've got
well used to be la ley corjera and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's a molasa is the new is the
different law or the newest newest one But
[SPEAKER_01]: basically it's tolerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have it have small quantities for
personal use You can grow and it depends
[SPEAKER_01]: on which part of Spain you live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Catalonia or Catalunya and Here
is a liberal quite liberal just like it is
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Basque Country And Yeah,
so here we we don't have much problem You
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to smoke it in front of the
cops or anything because you get a ticket
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 300 euros 300 to 600 euros for your
first offense and It's kind of a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh and those cops now listen to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got those electric motorcycles
Electric motor you can't hear the bastards
[SPEAKER_01]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit It's really rough Anyway But we've
got we've got smoking clubs here or
[SPEAKER_01]: private clubs and the club You can have
any kind of a club you want but some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Some of the things you can you can't
do or advertise can't advertise your club
[SPEAKER_01]: or advertise the cannabis or Have a front
window.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so you're supposed to have
everything closed and Not have a sign on
[SPEAKER_01]: the front door, but you can look everybody
a lot of people up on the internet So,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know It doesn't really matter that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just search for Cannabis Club Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah, yeah, that's it and
that's it and You'll find them But to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you've got to have national ID to be
able to go in some clubs make exceptions
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean it was like what the Wild
West for about About five years things
[SPEAKER_01]: happen slowly here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I go there now, they don't let me in
um you come over and Come over and hang
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd take you to club.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I can always get people in I know but
like what just like your average American
[SPEAKER_05]: tourists would they be able to go into one
of these clubs a Pardon would would like
[SPEAKER_05]: an average American tourist be able to go
into one of these clubs Or do you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: have some sort of local connect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Local ID and but you can you there's
several clubs that break all the rules,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there I mean you can see there was
then there was another one these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the heck were they from from Central
Europe somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never went over there, but they had
like, you know 20,000 members because you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to sign up and you know, you're only
supposed to have like 150 Yeah Like 20,000
[SPEAKER_01]: members and they were they were moving
some real poundage out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean some serious kilos and tourists
everybody They have people people would go
[SPEAKER_01]: to tourist areas and recruit recruit
tourists to go over there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was pretty wild for a while And
that's when span of this had started our
[SPEAKER_01]: well it kind of this was going pretty good
been going about ten years ten twelve
[SPEAKER_01]: years and somebody got the great idea to
you know, because when all of the sieves
[SPEAKER_01]: came out for separating and making the ice
hash they would At span of this you could
[SPEAKER_01]: go in there you could take in like ten
pounds of dough in the front door Give it
[SPEAKER_01]: to something give it to these guys at one
of the the stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would separate it They've run the
tumbler all night or had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: separate and and they would take 25% for
doing that and then they would give you
[SPEAKER_01]: just a chunk of hash back and That that
lasted that lasted one year and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah here span of this used to be the
the biggest The biggest trade fair in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world and then Las Vegas took it over now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now it's Germany But like I said,
it's cannabis is tolerated here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a very old hash culture
Morocco's just right across the Strait of
[SPEAKER_01]: Gibraltar so Yeah, and I remember when I
first got here that actually it was They
[SPEAKER_01]: have Well, they sell several, you know
lots of different grades ash but Katama,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Katama is just right over there
and in the Rift Mountains and Morocco but
[SPEAKER_01]: they have You know, they would package it
usually and in a hundred hundred gram
[SPEAKER_01]: plates black ass they come black asses in
grandma and then they were also and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we put a stamp on it and the double zero
Double zero stamp which usually is the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest grade in general and you can go in
like in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the best month because they
have the cream you can get yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I see Yeah, it's a pollen,
you know, I smoked I mean I mean to to to
[SPEAKER_07]: Andalusia a lot and to Barcelona I go
every year, you know, I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: friends in Spain a lot, you know Yeah,
so I really know what you're talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about, you know Years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took bubble bags with me to Spain,
you know, because we used to make hash for
[SPEAKER_07]: that You know the bubble hash this was in
2005 or something, you know or four,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know and These Andalusians,
you know They were showing me their inner
[SPEAKER_07]: gardens, you know in the houses because
all of them were growing weed growers
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor outdoor everything There was a lot
of cannabis but still they told me that
[SPEAKER_07]: there is so much hash But just flour is
just in the season when they had a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit of flour, you know More or less.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all a hash culture in the third or
fourth generation already
[SPEAKER_01]: To make the transition from hash to
cannabis that took about ten years Because
[SPEAKER_01]: now cannabis is more more popular than
hash here But it took a long time because
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you could go get your your veota
They call them they call 10 grams 10
[SPEAKER_01]: grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually call it an acorn Yeah 10
grams, but you can buy a And the best the
[SPEAKER_01]: best hashes that is el culero,
culero I see culero, culero Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get you guys I mean this pretty gross,
but you they they take the 10 ground
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces and wrap them up in cellophane or
Yeah, a plastic wrap anything and then
[SPEAKER_01]: swallow swallow them and You average
person here's important stats average
[SPEAKER_01]: person can get About a kilo two point two
pounds in their stomach and all the way up
[SPEAKER_01]: to about here After that two hundred grams
up the buck a Double dicker So I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: question for you Jorge it sounds like you
have a Experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a culero?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been across the border with
Maybe just Lots of water on a bar Okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you've officially told the best
story ever told on the show Can you can
[SPEAKER_05]: you describe the what you were talking
about the crema or if You if you make it
[SPEAKER_05]: to the cream the cream the stuff that was
like the really nice stuff They call it
[SPEAKER_01]: butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uh That's like the blonde shit Yeah,
not not so But it's soft and pliable
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's it's it's new It's new and
you don't but you only get it right then
[SPEAKER_01]: because otherwise it gets oxidized and
stuff But this is more of a blonde color
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's pliable it's pliable like that
and A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, you know, a lot of times
you figure the hash will be hard like your
[SPEAKER_01]: phone, you know But yeah, and then it's
got a consistency you use a knife to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it always a hot knife and Yeah,
it's so It's it can be sticky it depends
[SPEAKER_01]: on the quality as far as the stickiness
goes and if you're lucky it won't it won't
[SPEAKER_01]: have too much like a camel shit smell
Because the camel shit because they made
[SPEAKER_01]: the camels eat it too I don't think they'd
waste it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't I Wouldn't give a camel my
dough Rather a camel do the smuggling for
[SPEAKER_02]: me than me I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna I'm gonna catch some heat for
that They probably have a way bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach You gotta have a vet on call Yeah,
they probably want to quarantine him for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't talk about that It's animal
abuse Yeah, uh, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did a video on it who later?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so just we'll put a link Yeah,
but the link on the bottom of the show
[SPEAKER_02]: notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's on my my youtube channel
Yeah, we'll put all of your links in the
[SPEAKER_02]: description to the podcast so people can
find Your legit stuff not just a
[SPEAKER_01]: counterfeit my buddy over and Russia did
this but it's they pirated it in in Russia
[SPEAKER_01]: in Russia and Dubbed it they got a
professional of dub artist so to overdub
[SPEAKER_01]: it and they didn't and they didn't put
What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Subtitles on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So I was pretty impressed,
you know, even though they took it All of
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys, you know, I mean I got a lot
of Russian friends I like me there's good
[SPEAKER_01]: guys Some really good guys some other ones
pretty tough guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But um Yeah, it's uh Well, it's important
to get the information out But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually quite quite big in Russia
here I'll show you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Here I got
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I was like I have no idea what
language that is Here's another one this
[SPEAKER_01]: was Chinese Yeah, yeah, I like on the
Russian one that it shows you just
[SPEAKER_04]: pointing to a giant cannabis plant like,
you know We'd miss it if you weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing it out Yeah, and here's here's
the other Mugs and then here's the this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the original book that I printed myself
Well, and it's 90 pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the artwork myself Very good But
this book Actually, yeah, there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: book It's it first year it sold 6,000
copies Which and that's just in the
[SPEAKER_01]: northwest and that's a pretty darn good
that's without bookstores selling it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Like you said everybody hated you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are just How were you getting
it like marketed?
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you get it the infant like the
word out that you had this book at that
[SPEAKER_05]: time with no And not wanting to carry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my car drove around all the head
shops and Would sell them and then I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: most usually had to leave them on
consignment because nobody believed that
[SPEAKER_01]: it would sell because they didn't know
what the hell is going on and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I did and then so it took and
then also I had two distributors on the
[SPEAKER_01]: West Coast Olmstead books and of from
Seattle and Was owned by a good friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine David Tatelman and all and then the
other one was last gasp of San Francisco
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron Turner down there and those guys would
also distribute to head shops and some
[SPEAKER_01]: bookstores but not the mainstream
bookstores What year was that and how much
[SPEAKER_05]: were you selling it for?
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 1983 and I was selling this for
$8.95 Wow Yeah, $8.95 and I rendered on a
[SPEAKER_01]: Multilith Multilith press and Stapled it
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much work But I guess it panned
out after a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean people needed the needed the
information How much of that information
[SPEAKER_05]: do you think is transferable to today's
growing culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the walk Pretty much all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I mean last been growing
the same for the last, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Millennials Some stuff doesn't change
gravity still the same as it used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: you know But there's more more precise
information now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more specific information on
Nutrients nutrients were the big thing
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, you know, they've got the best
nutrients blah blah blah Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where all the money was you know,
it costs about a nickel or five cents to
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a gallon of fertilizer that you
can sell for 30 or $40 or more So that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good markup and that's why there
was some Yeah, and it's a consumable right
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Phil from Conomic when I told him
you were gonna join the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said oh, that's exciting Ask him for me
if he could make a single revision to his
[SPEAKER_02]: famous nutrient chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just think it's funny that you know,
we asked a question and you said that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what had changed was nutrients,
but uh Would you make a revision?
[SPEAKER_01]: to your chart you mean that the the
excesses and deficiencies it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be these here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the older book and Then I made a
newer one in the encyclopedia which is
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is here And there's a series of
drawings like this Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think he could be referring to
these I would I would just Tighten them up
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd interview more people and But
everything's correct It's funny the those
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient photos the the photos that show
deficiencies That was all we had as
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know like back in the day,
you know When you couldn't talk to people
[SPEAKER_02]: about this there was no internet And with
that book, you know, we'd look at our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants it'd be like is that nitrogen
deficiency or is it calcium deficiency and
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like I said so many growers would
love to just chime in right now and say
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you came out with a new book,
we had to buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know, I purchased every edition
that you put out during my growing growing
[SPEAKER_01]: career so yeah, yeah, there's a lot of
people have because just It's the only
[SPEAKER_01]: place you could find the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I be so bold as to make a suggestion
for your next book?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure So something that I learned,
you know, I don't know Five ten years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: should have been a lot longer is because
we've always been using your book and
[SPEAKER_02]: those diagrams to tell us what the
nutrient deficiency What it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: address is what a combination of nutrient
deficiencies would look like and That's
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard because right but the point is
is that People too often look at the book
[SPEAKER_02]: and they say oh this is what it is but now
you can send leafs out for analysis and
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf analysis is going to show you
something very different than that book is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, well because you've got you've
got a combination of different nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can what I can do here if you're
you know, you read the text.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of times this is confused
Calcium for example, I'm looking at that
[SPEAKER_01]: that entry now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's confused with Lots of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's quite important what it's
confused with root disease Excess nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium magnesium calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough pages in a book to show
pictures of all Possible come no,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you could I just want people
to know that like for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say you have nitrogen and calcium
deficiency Okay, because they're both
[SPEAKER_02]: confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually have both deficient
When you add calcium unless it's calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrate maybe that would solve the problem
because you'd be getting a calcium and
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen You know, you may not be
addressing the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So particularly on a commercial scale when
the farmers can afford to do it I always
[SPEAKER_02]: tell people that they should be doing leaf
analysis their entire crop at least at
[SPEAKER_02]: least the first couple of times so that
they can figure out what's going on and
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of arrogance and
growers and they look at them go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a calcium deficient But that
arrogance it slows them down and like I
[SPEAKER_02]: said luckily now we have testing we have
tools available that we didn't have That's
[SPEAKER_01]: right actually in America, they don't test
that much For genetics is what I think
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be testing a lot more when you
talk about Eric And growers breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: quote-unquote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does tell you that before it goes into
the before it goes into each one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: explanations of each one of the nutrients
that 99% of the times these happen
[SPEAKER_01]: together these nutrient I guess I haven't
read the book in long enough, but I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have the most latest copy You know,
I can see the future of this to utilizing
[SPEAKER_04]: AI AI is being utilized in a lot of
medical testing, you know for cancer
[SPEAKER_04]: screening especially but potentially
someone could create an app or utilize the
[SPEAKER_04]: phone's camera and Take a picture of the
leaf and then they can analyze it using AI
[SPEAKER_04]: to you know Say this is the possible
causes of whatever you're seeing on your
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf You know Apple already has that on my
Apple watch or I mean my Apple computer
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find a plant picture, but it does it
identify plants The thing is it needs the
[SPEAKER_01]: data first to input that thing I did is
I've been making books You know all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought well 11 languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the first good Dutch Marik wanna
been in this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the first one might have one have
been in first a good Yeah, no van Schaaf
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of straight books vegetables
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, here's another one the They the
Hells Angels, you know from The the really
[SPEAKER_01]: rough guys, they're the ones from Laval
Laval Canada, it's a suburb of Montreal
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're the Generally consider the
roughest bunch there is because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: tough guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they they pirated one of my books
The Bible yeah, and so I called them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the phone number called them up and
The conversation ended like fuck you will
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck you will fuck you come over here and
say that fuck you and anyway, I was I
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to sue them but Then you had to
collect the money and the lawyer wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: get paid first So I couldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was my my revenge What I did is I
went to China and I made the book of Color
[SPEAKER_01]: full color and what that did is it made it
too expensive for him to steal and So I
[SPEAKER_01]: look at it is like yes, it was really a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad they took the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy Yeah, I've done a lot of
other other ones German German That was a
[SPEAKER_01]: biggie that's done real well I've done
outdoor books indoor books in German No,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, it's it's a hard one to learn It's a
hard one if you don't learn it from when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're young, you know, and so many
Germans speak English or trying to find
[SPEAKER_02]: some European people to do the podcast
with with Sasha and Germany's is huge
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping oh, yeah Vince And weed is
really a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's he's he's like number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great guy Great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's tons of interest now in in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market went up really high and then
it's gonna went down We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happened What happens in
the future They sure had a big fair this
[SPEAKER_00]: year though or last year last year did you
Did you go Slovenian?
[SPEAKER_07]: No until now Mary Jane, I will go this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will go to Mary Jane But friends of mine
are going there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to Barcelona every year,
you know, this is for me, but now Germany
[SPEAKER_07]: because it legalized I mean Definitely and
I have a I have I sell to Germany clones,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know I'm selling just today went out
five six packages of clones For German
[SPEAKER_07]: market, you know because home growers can
buy by genetics now You know, it is it's
[SPEAKER_07]: opened up It's a limit five plants a
person I can send but yeah, the market is
[SPEAKER_07]: open and the beautiful thing is that I as
a producer I have a really exotic library,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know for for the market because
Austria is a big market for for this So if
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't have your own selections your
own connections that gave you genetics
[SPEAKER_07]: then you cannot compete on the market
because If you just have few old cards
[SPEAKER_07]: that everybody else has, you know,
it's like You know, you have to you have
[SPEAKER_07]: to be able to compete on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is for sure in any cannabis business
I think you know any you have to be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to to be smart and to to to change with
with time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh So so those guys so you're shipping
them out of Austria then yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm shipping out of Austria Normal Express
mail Wow That's good and they don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: well theirs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a European passport also for that
So that means that you get checked once a
[SPEAKER_07]: year by the governmental official You
know, it's called August and they they
[SPEAKER_07]: make tests and they see if everything is
alright and then they give you the The
[SPEAKER_07]: passport for next year again, you know,
so it's that's Yeah, it's a system thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Austria It's really turned out to be
a good place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Other friends that are quite
productive there Yeah Yeah, gosh,
[SPEAKER_02]: so, you know, I just want to make sure we
did and You know, it was totally cool But
[SPEAKER_02]: we skipped forward a little bit and I
wanted to find out if you had any more
[SPEAKER_02]: stories from the age Around the we
mentioned Tom Alexander a little bit but I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to make sure that you mentioned your
time at since Amelia tips Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I mean I wrote for seeing some media
tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't It was Alex's magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started it and it was his 100% And they
he was in business about ten years before
[SPEAKER_01]: a green merchant happened because green
merchants is oh Well, that's what shutting
[SPEAKER_01]: down because all of these advertisers quit
They were out of business and that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: he started growing edge Yeah, yeah growing
edge and that was that was quite a good
[SPEAKER_02]: magazine when I get on the show It might
be a good idea to have you on too Because
[SPEAKER_02]: then we got you know, two old friends
telling stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you guys have a bunch of stories
together I got one quick question before
[SPEAKER_04]: we wrap up and you know might be a pretty
quick answer But I mean you've seen the
[SPEAKER_04]: evolution of cannabis throughout decades,
you know And I'm sure you you had favorite
[SPEAKER_04]: strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned Hayes isn't one of your
favorites I guess this is kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: two-part question How does modern
cannabis, you know compare in your opinion
[SPEAKER_04]: to kind of what you grew up and what you
saw evolve throughout the years and To you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, what would you say your favorite
modern strain is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah modern straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see it's Actually, it was really
quite strong some time ago, but I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit spoiled Because I've been fortunate to
be around Expert growers all the time But
[SPEAKER_01]: it has improved it has improved there's
just much more information now a much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger selection But I have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the gene pool is pretty pretty
polluted There's not consistent breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you know true breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's no So many of those people
That are quote-unquote breeders are not
[SPEAKER_01]: formally educated Because breeding is
usually about numbers numbers lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be really good with math You
know That that part's changed The lower in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has gotten tons better lots
better It used to be the Mexican dope you
[SPEAKER_01]: get here You know, I mean be lucky to get
8% or you'd get in America and it would
[SPEAKER_01]: smell like ammonia Yeah Very well good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes sometimes not but it
depends on how wet it was when they have
[SPEAKER_02]: it press it when it was fresh it would
mold Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well a lot of times that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use those those adobe brick presses
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah They do and then Modern strains I
like old stuff to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, there's There's new
stuff but and and also I got to admit this
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the best palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the best taste buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I can't distinguish things so well a
lot of people say they do but I know
[SPEAKER_01]: enough about smell to know that I am one
of the many and there's very few or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you know The top end is 5% and then of
those there's 1% of that 5% that's a super
[SPEAKER_01]: taste You know, so most the time when you
hear things and people tell you they they
[SPEAKER_01]: experience stuff They're going on memory a
lot of times I can grow CBD here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact I'm gonna start that pretty soon
grow CBD I'll start that in the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: basement where I've got Got a deal going
with AC infinity AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got all kind of actually they've
got really cool equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty Yeah, I like their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's a top end and it's also
Everything's digitized a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: have been mentioning to me that they like
that that they like their gear Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's well, it's true actually they I
was over there hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went on a couple week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two-week trip around the Northern
California we're in Garberville nice
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't make on the Willis but Garberville
and And over to the other side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were at the Ridgeline farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those guys were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I'm watching you partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm a Facebook stalker Actually had
one one question also before we wrapped up
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering as cosmic said you've seen the
evolution of not only the different
[SPEAKER_05]: strains over the years But the evolution
of growing in both like a home growing and
[SPEAKER_05]: a commercial aspect What do you think is
like the single biggest improvement that
[SPEAKER_05]: you've witnessed take place in the
cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: space LEDs LED lights because they made
everything else obsolete They had to
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just too much heat coming out of
those allies they're Sodiums there's there
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's sodiums as well and the
combination lights Well, you know they go
[SPEAKER_01]: either sodium or halide but you have to
you know, you can Drive them with the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger transformer, but they burn out
sooner Yeah, that's that's got to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest thing Yeah, and also the spectrum
on those lights is just much much more
[SPEAKER_02]: conducive to growing And one I want to add
one thing to that so and and I also if you
[SPEAKER_02]: have one more moment I want to make sure
that Sasha doesn't have any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to ask too, but um, I think that
environmental control is actually Had more
[SPEAKER_02]: of an impact than the lighting because
high-pressure sodiums and halide We do a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good job you know, but one major
issue that cultivators that have had is
[SPEAKER_02]: Lack of environmental control and so now I
believe that more people are trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: control their environment and that's
having a really dramatic effect on You
[SPEAKER_02]: know how the plant grows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting interesting to say
that because As is this industry developed
[SPEAKER_01]: all the money was in Fertilizer that's
where you make the money Fertilizer you
[SPEAKER_01]: sell the fertilizer and that's where the
biggest markup was That's where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: energy went was go into the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fertilizer is better than yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's consumable Yeah, and it's a
consumable and think And the air you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: see it, you know you you look right
through it People don't realize just how
[SPEAKER_01]: much how important ventilation is or air
circulation have no clue there's no way
[SPEAKER_01]: they and Before you couldn't measure
Measure the co2 level really Inexpensively
[SPEAKER_01]: there was those tubes so you'd suck the
chemical fruit right and get a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction and have to read Some color which
is pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a digital readout Now you've got
co2 monitors are really inexpensive or
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly inexpensive And also it can be
integrated together too fairly easily
[SPEAKER_01]: before you'd have to have Relays and set
up your own system basically and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: basic knowledge of electricity and You
know when the timer goes off the fan goes
[SPEAKER_02]: goes on and products Harmon Yeah,
he put out the first control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah another og maybe we can get him on
one day But he made a controller that
[SPEAKER_02]: would turn off your co2 when your exhaust
fan came on Yeah, and it's just simple
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would just like to thank you man
because you don't even know how important
[SPEAKER_07]: your your Book was for us at the time
where we were a new country.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we were in Yugoslavia You know people
in Yugoslavia had you had your book also,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like this is crazy, man It's
like right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen so many people Growers,
you know having your book on the shelf in
[SPEAKER_07]: those places.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do you don't even know man It's like
you you did something really you really
[SPEAKER_07]: did a really big contribution to the
community to the culture, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't have a big ego that's also what
makes him such a beautiful person Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just I did my part, you know,
the part that was different with me was
[SPEAKER_01]: With different with me with most people
would get information and they would take
[SPEAKER_01]: that information and make money with it
and keep it to themselves My goal was to
[SPEAKER_01]: go the other way to do the opposite of
that and It is a lot of hard work for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of years, but it's finally it's you
know Finally pays off Everybody everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else is happy too Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I want to leave you with this One of my
favorite musicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you could you might love him too
was Jerry Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, and I used to have Friends that
would leave the Dead Show early To go wait
[SPEAKER_02]: at Jerry's hotel to get an autograph and
say hello to him I always thought they
[SPEAKER_02]: were crazy because I used to say I'm here
for the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, you know groupie to go Right,
but the thing about it is now that Jerry's
[SPEAKER_02]: passed one of my biggest regrets was never
being able to just say Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not to ask him for something or to
take a picture I mean, I'd love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have a picture of me and
Garcia, right?
