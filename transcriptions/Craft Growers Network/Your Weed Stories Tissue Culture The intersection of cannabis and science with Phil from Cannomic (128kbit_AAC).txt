[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to your weed stories on the Craft
Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we are joined by Phil Estrin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the tissue culture expert from
Conomic and the Grateful Head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited to learn about his story and
we think we're gonna learn at least a
[SPEAKER_01]: little something about tissue culture
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the show, Phil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh and of course we've got our Slovenian
Hobbit, Sasha, joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our European correspondent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also very interested in learning
about some tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Phil, why don't we start by you telling
us a little bit about your cannabis story,
[SPEAKER_01]: how your first experiences in cannabis and
how it led you to tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my first experiences are pretty
common, but just a bunch of guys who are
[SPEAKER_04]: friends, hanging out, smoking,
not knowing if I'm doing it right the
[SPEAKER_04]: first time, coughing more than I expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then eventually it clicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think by the time I was in my early 20s,
cannabis had found a mainstay in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was fortunate enough to be studying
genetics at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was an opportunity, I'm
originally from the state of Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_04]: it had just expanded into medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was an opportunity when I was in
grad school to work at a medical facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really the gateway that
showed me that it could be a career path
[SPEAKER_04]: and then more than just a personal
lifestyle, something that can be a
[SPEAKER_04]: community and attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since then I never thought of working
in any other industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your role at that cannabis
facility?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was a extraction laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically I was just like a low tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Connecticut, very funny in the
beginning, they did not necessarily know
[SPEAKER_04]: how to legalize cannabis and how to
legalize these kind of auxiliary things
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be associated with cannabis,
like extraction and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So initially they did not allow any
organic solvents, including water,
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty tough in a facility
outside of the extraction lab,
[SPEAKER_04]: not being able to use water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they quickly remediated that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They allowed alcohol, but you couldn't use
hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Connecticut, at least in 2015,
2016, all they were using was super
[SPEAKER_04]: critical CO2 because it was solventless at
that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know about necessarily the
techniques that we have nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was ramping up super critical systems,
running them very far away from my biology
[SPEAKER_04]: background.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they had initially had interest in
doing tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they asked me to figure out how to do
it essentially, which is what ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: leading me into this specific pursuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where were you studying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that in Connecticut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, University of Connecticut.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Slasher, you're muted, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beside the ethanol and CO2, super
critical, did you also use butane
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction?
[SPEAKER_02]: Butane?
[SPEAKER_04]: So at that time, you could not use any
hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use anything, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it legal to use butane today in
Connecticut?
[SPEAKER_04]: So Connecticut's in a very interesting
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for reference, in 2015, 2016,
when I was there, it was only medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only had four producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since then, they've expanded to adult use,
and they've expanded to four producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the same people that were
providing for medical have now split their
[SPEAKER_04]: product between medical and adult use.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rules around adult use, I'm not
exactly familiar with, but I am pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: confident that medical is still only
allowed to be solventless.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now with the librosins and stuff like
that, there has been an expanded
[SPEAKER_04]: portfolio, but there's no closed-loop
systems or stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you were studying, you were
studying biology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you said?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I went to school for molecular
biology, basically genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were you interested in studying
before you got into Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Canada as far as molecular biology?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in general, genetics had always
fascinated me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability to kind of meet the moment
when chemistry gained some sentience,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though I think there's a lot of very
good chemists out there who would say
[SPEAKER_04]: there's even prior examples of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, that was the first thing that
clicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had worked in immunology labs before and
done a lot of background material work,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of genetics work, a lot of viral
work, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think especially when we apply these
techniques to medical research and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, there's a lot of potential for
therapeutics that traditional medical
[SPEAKER_04]: approaches couldn't necessarily solve or
target.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was always very fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of working for a company like
AstraZeneca or Pfizer was a lot less
[SPEAKER_04]: appetizing to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ultimately, that cannabis being an
alternative pathway was very tantalizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you were asked to learn about
tissue culture, how did you start that
[SPEAKER_01]: journey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was still at the University of
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in the genetics department finishing
up my master's while doing this work at
[SPEAKER_04]: this medical marijuana facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they asked me I just went to the
plant science department and asked a
[SPEAKER_04]: professor by the name of Gerald Berkowitz,
who was doing tissue culture on a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: called Arabidopsis, a model organism for
plant science, but not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_04]: commercially or consumer common crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I asked him and he was like,
I have no idea how to do it, but why don't
[SPEAKER_04]: you just come and like study here and
maybe we could figure out together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, why don't I just come and
study here and we can figure it out
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I very promptly left the
opportunity I had at the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: facility and continued to do research
under Gerald Berkowitz's lab at the
[SPEAKER_04]: University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there, at that time, only a lot of
publications from Ole Miss were
[SPEAKER_04]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was our starting point,
as I believe many people's starting points
[SPEAKER_04]: back at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were fortunate to find something
that worked and when my time finished at
[SPEAKER_04]: UConn, we came and started Kanoic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a question is, was it allowed and
did that even matter to experiment on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at the University since you did
not have a license through the University?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so yes it was allowed because in
2016 they had passed the Farm Bill,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was the first time that they allowed
research institutions and agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions to research CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like no one was doing the THCA nifty
loopholes that you might see nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one was really talking about DA and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just let's find some fiber seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's find some like auto flowering for
seed production seeds of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just get some material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think one thing to note is many
times in biology, it is not a game of
[SPEAKER_04]: what's best, but a game of what's first.
[SPEAKER_04]: E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli is a classic model organism,
not because it is the best bacteria,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it is very easy to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is in all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that makes it very easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be, arguably nowadays,
much better model organism to build from,
[SPEAKER_04]: but E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli was first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were in the same place.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just needed whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would love to have worked with really
good quality substances, but sourcing
[SPEAKER_04]: material was very tough and it very much
mattered.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to a lot of lawyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because UNECON is Connecticut's flagship
public state university, their legal staff
[SPEAKER_04]: is essentially the assistant AG and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them wanted to talk to us and make
sure that we were interpreting the Farm
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill correctly, obviously not being
lawyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, long story short, they okayed
us to do it and UConn has a very
[SPEAKER_04]: successful hemp program ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so were you actually using low THC
hemp or were you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: The process is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, much to the point of using today's
justifications at that time, we are not
[SPEAKER_04]: following anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tissue culture doesn't require any
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever material is tested will show
up with the same THC as corn, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from that perspective, that's what the
Farm Bill kind of limited us to and we
[SPEAKER_04]: very much played within that bounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us which strains of hemp were
you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: You said phenola?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so later on, I mean again,
when we initially got these, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: just whatever was accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, once it came time to
publication, a lot of journals will
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily accept it's we trust me bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was sent in for genetic
fingerprinting and the closest related
[SPEAKER_04]: other fingerprinted plant was phenola.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was just subscribed as phenola too
and we continued onward.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very early flowering hemp variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it here also.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use quite a lot of hemp here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenola is like a standard here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like every third field is phenola
here because it's so early.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes little sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point when we eventually switched
to American crops, we had like cherry wine
[SPEAKER_04]: and abacus, I believe was another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, unfortunately, my memory is
not so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2015, 16 is becoming further and
further away every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe those were like the major
ones and yeah, undeniably the phenola was
[SPEAKER_04]: in many ways very nice because it's fast
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not very hybridized.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just puts out a lot of plant
material, not necessarily the greatest
[SPEAKER_04]: morphology, but a lot of morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cherry wine and abacus were much more,
they were more realistically just like
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional cannabis strains that had
generated a knocked out version of the THC
[SPEAKER_04]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they immediately became hemp and
that made them very commercially viable
[SPEAKER_04]: because they had really good metabolic
pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: They produced a lot of CBD and they looked
like commercially viable indoor plants
[SPEAKER_04]: versus phenola.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that the papers were
published.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something that anyone can find?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to secure funding, you got to keep
publishing in academia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ever since I've left, they've been
publishing like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you search Berkowitz, you'll find
Berkowitz cannabis, you'll find a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: good interviews that he's done and a lot
of his publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like you said, they are continuing
to study tissue culture and hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the reality is when you look at
something in academia and in publications,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's called an impact factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look at any journal that you want
plus the word impact factor and it'll tell
[SPEAKER_04]: you a number.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that number is above three,
it means that it's at least peer reviewed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of times, a lot of very funky
science from a lot of obscure papers will
[SPEAKER_04]: get like a 1.2 publication, a 2.3.
[SPEAKER_04]: It means no one looked at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no journalistic insight,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The impact factor typically means
impactful to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So medical journals are always going to be
at the highest of the impact factor
[SPEAKER_04]: because anything they discover in medicine
is immediately going to be applicable to
[SPEAKER_04]: many, many people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So New England Journal of Medicine is one
of the highest.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Journal of the American Medical
Association, JAMA, is the second highest.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared to something like science is a
10.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other ones that I just listed,
they're 50 plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're radically different ballpark the
highest one in plants, plant cell or plant
[SPEAKER_04]: science, depending on which one or plant
physiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like four, four and a half,
five.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see traditionally plant
research is considered pretty low impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis has an incredible benefit in
being a therapeutic plant as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it traditionally scores much higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you are a plant department in
desperate need of funding, jumping onto
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is an assured way to bump up your
publication scores and potentially secure
[SPEAKER_04]: better funding and grants in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Connecticut is not an agricultural state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis being studied at UConn
provided the plant science department,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was a relatively minor department,
I think a lot of opportunities that
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional research in like Aronia,
which is a plant I had never heard of
[SPEAKER_04]: before I worked in that department,
would probably not bring to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one that they were studying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have not heard of it since.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting that you said that plants
don't get that high of a rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that include food?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, because you would think like
food is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, water, it's one of the most
important things we have on this on this
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, at the same time,
science is not altruistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone is footing the bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this always leads to a large
concerning conversation on ethics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the good old days of Isaac Newton,
whatever all of those people, every
[SPEAKER_04]: scientist we've heard of from before 1800s
came from an incredibly wealthy family and
[SPEAKER_04]: usually had a castle that they were doing
all these stuff and they're in their
[SPEAKER_04]: basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why they all pursued out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously been more democratized
since then, but it still needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: funded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is like, like corn or
agricultural crops in this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Corn is the largest one that we plant 70%
of plantable corn is not for food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for ethanol production, grain feed,
stuff that might eventually lead to food
[SPEAKER_04]: being produced, especially for cattle
production, but ultimately not calories
[SPEAKER_04]: meant for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: That ethanol producing corn gets a lot
more research into it than publicly than
[SPEAKER_04]: food grade corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And food grade corn is mostly researched
by Bayer and large scale ag companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their incentive to share that research
is limited.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's a very fascinating,
frustrating web, but I think that's big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you have your own lab,
you can study anything you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the beautiful things
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of, for example,
easy to cultivate organisms like fungi
[SPEAKER_04]: that a lot of foragers out there will go
with a Petri dish and they'll isolate
[SPEAKER_04]: fungal isolates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, if they want to
sequence it, that's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to do that in computational
biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that's accessible, but to put a
academic lab into that, it would be hard
[SPEAKER_04]: to incentivize them unless there is
financial incentive and cannabis offered
[SPEAKER_04]: that to a large amount of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say that I'm recording this
podcast for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if everyone else likes it,
then good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find what you're saying is it's
awakening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm enjoying the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a perspective of somebody who's like
a lab rat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're a, you're somebody from,
from the science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people from science and labs always
have a perspective, which is more
[SPEAKER_02]: realistic than any others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, you, like you'd say
money rules these kinds of markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, even the science behind it,
it's ruled by, by big investments and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the world is going like this
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should be aware that it's going on
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think similarly, like many good
people can be swayed by many directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes someone can make a
decision that we don't agree with,
[SPEAKER_04]: that we might think is more or less of a
bankrupt, but they have alternative forces
[SPEAKER_04]: that are pushing them to make these
decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Family members, financial crisis,
whatever it is, we should be as
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding as we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately science isn't good or bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's purely discovering facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people like matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Carrie discovered some of the most
important facts in terms of radiation,
[SPEAKER_04]: how it can develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: She ultimately paid the price for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And her notebooks are continued to be so
radioactive that they have to be locked
[SPEAKER_04]: away and can only be shown behind display.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a very altruistic approach to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet it's still ultimately she
sacrificed her life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're very fortunate to be playing
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while our discoveries are fascinating,
they, you know, stand on the shoulders of
[SPEAKER_04]: the people who came before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you started to talk about
before about how you went into the program
[SPEAKER_02]: in Connecticut, in the university with
this professor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you describe your first years,
you know, how it was for you, the
[SPEAKER_02]: failures, you know, you have to make a lot
of failures, I think, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the department that I went to was very,
very nice, very accommodating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone there was very curious about
starting to pursue into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all wanted to offer help.
[SPEAKER_04]: And me having never worked with plants
prior was extremely grateful for any help
[SPEAKER_04]: that could be brought.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way that you tissue culture or
opidopsis is different than how you tissue
[SPEAKER_04]: culture tobacco, different than how you
tissue culture tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these were plants that people working
with in the department.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they all approached me and were like,
maybe this hormone, maybe this
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration of hormones, maybe this
media base, maybe that a lot of failures,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of frustrations, especially early
on, very insightful sentiment is we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know what we don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had no idea where to even start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea what was deficiency,
what was toxicity, what played well
[SPEAKER_04]: together, what was synergistic,
what was antagonistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, though, you get your first
success.
[SPEAKER_04]: Classically, I think the way to build it
is science is incremental, success is
[SPEAKER_04]: incremental.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get 5% success before you get 10%
success, before you get 20% success,
[SPEAKER_04]: before you get 40% success, before you get
80% success.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at some point, you're just
figuring out what your margin of error is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it 99%, 99.9%, 99.999%?
[SPEAKER_04]: And at some point, you consider yourself
to have successfully tissue cultured the
[SPEAKER_04]: strain, the plant, however broad your
successes are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can promise you in the beginning,
it was far away from where we are now,
[SPEAKER_04]: almost 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you said this was 2018?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know about the advantages of
tissue culture for cannabis at that time
[SPEAKER_02]: when you started?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because today, because of these viruses,
and pathogens, and endophytes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all this, we know why it's good for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And preserving genetics, of course,
in a small facility you can preserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you know that at that time when you
started it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the realities is an academic mind
and industrial mind might be different,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though they both at the fundamental
stage are trying to solve problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problems that they might be trying to
solve are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: In academia, tissue culture is simply a
means to an end.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost exclusively use it to propagate
organs or cells, like mammalian tissue
[SPEAKER_04]: culture, bacterial tissue culture,
fungal tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly it's done post genetic engineering,
because you have a cell that is very easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to engineer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't necessarily do genetic
engineering on even two cells,
[SPEAKER_04]: because if you only successfully do one,
you have a chimerical genetic organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50% is genetically modified, and 50% is
wild type.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to go down to one cell,
the base quanta of basically living
[SPEAKER_04]: biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you need to remunerate your
organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you do tissue culture to get that one
cell to many cells, to an organ,
[SPEAKER_04]: to a complex tissue, into an organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always how I had been taught about
it, had seen it utilized in research
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_04]: In academia, and then in the industry,
it was radically different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're talking about growing high
densities of monocultures in enclosed
[SPEAKER_04]: environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the risk of communicable diseases
getting in there and spreading is much,
[SPEAKER_04]: much higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now using tissue culture as a means of
putting this potentially sick plant into a
[SPEAKER_04]: pocket of sterility, cleaning it in that
pocket of sterility, and then regenerating
[SPEAKER_04]: a clean plant is unique to industry
pursuit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily one that you see
commonly, and personally not one that I
[SPEAKER_04]: had ever seen done in academia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was new.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a new way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, the technique and the steps
are the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're reconstituting a cell,
or a meristem, or nodes, or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: the timeline might be just a little bit
more extended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the reason why it wasn't as used with
other plants, because more of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: seed grown?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if I would say less used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the thing is- I meant as far as
getting rid of virus and disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe I misunderstood you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the thing is most other plants
have alternative strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That are allowed in their industries or
accepted in their industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one of the things is like the
easiest way to get a PM resistant plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: to find a single protein that PM uses to
latch onto the plant and either change its
[SPEAKER_04]: confirmation or remove it entirely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you don't have any more PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you can just spray PM on your
plants and they'll never get on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to spray any pesticides or
anything like that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the cannabis community in
general has certain negative attitudes
[SPEAKER_04]: towards GM crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's totally within their respective
to hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So within being, again, an industry lab
that has to be aware of people's attitudes
[SPEAKER_04]: and pressures, you want to do what is most
acceptable in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tissue culture has been forced that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you look at how to remediate
like hopsa and viroid, which is not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily spread to a lot of other
plants, but there are other viroids,
[SPEAKER_04]: much to your point, that have spread to
other plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are usually remediated in other ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe sometimes they do use stuff like
Maristam and thermal combinatorial
[SPEAKER_04]: methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: But oftentimes they'll use something
different that we're just not using in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a chemical application?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like I mentioned, genetic engineering
crops are very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in America, you're not allowed to buy
directly genetically engineered crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's slowly changing under the last two
administrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But genetically engineered byproducts are
very allowed in food.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go pick up a Snickers bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll say right on there, made with
genetically bioengineered or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: terminology they're trying to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more accepted in their pursuits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think cannabis has a very holistic
attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be really respectful of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so part of that leads to, yeah,
Maristam is the industry accepted way of
[SPEAKER_04]: remediating something like hopsa and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too much into that,
I wanted to ask you about, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: ethics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering, when you went to the
university, if this was a question of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said Professor Berkowitz immediately
was hip to the idea of doing this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But was there any pushback from any of the
other members of the university?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure if I really thought about it,
potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because similarly, the university is not a
monolith.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the professors come from different
countries that have varying different
[SPEAKER_04]: attitudes, some even more positive and
some potentially more negative towards
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, drug research in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would probably be naive to say there
wasn't any pushback.
[SPEAKER_04]: To say that I experienced any of it,
I can certainly say no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in the plant science department at
this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much everyone I knew in the
molecular biology department smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the professors smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not certainly talked about very
readily.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a moment where one of my
best friends who was doing his graduate
[SPEAKER_04]: program at the same time as I,
his professor was about to publish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his protocol for publishing was to
basically go home, lock himself away for
[SPEAKER_04]: two weeks to write the whole manuscript,
and just smoke like a pound of weed during
[SPEAKER_04]: that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he asked me to help him procure the
pound of weed for the professor to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was in the program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, as many times I have helped
people, this is hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not obviously what the program is
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: The professor got what he needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my experience with it was almost like
everyone was fascinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone is doing fascinating research on
this illness, that plant, this organism,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were kind of doing the cool thing,
the taboo thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people were like, where do you
guys go?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you guys going to tackle this
approach?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very, very enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from there, when you started to
have success, you made your own company,
[SPEAKER_01]: Canomic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I left UConn, I had already had
some very positive industry connections
[SPEAKER_04]: that I had talked to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just from being with UConn, a lot of
people in the industry, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: we talked about funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at the time, and I mean,
it's still techopeus, cannabis is schedule
[SPEAKER_04]: one, a federally illegal substance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And UConn is a federally funded school.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we were to use federal funds on
cannabis, there was a risk or a concern
[SPEAKER_04]: that all federal funding for the entire
school, every unrelated department,
[SPEAKER_04]: from psychology to puppetry to everything
that got any federal funding, would get
[SPEAKER_04]: their federal funding pulled, obviously,
in addition to us in the science
[SPEAKER_04]: department.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I asked the question about
ethics and pushback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so that's fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: From a funding perspective, we couldn't
write a traditional grant and go through
[SPEAKER_04]: that type of process, which is what every
other laboratory in that department was
[SPEAKER_04]: basically doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to go and find industry partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Connecticut at the time had Cura Leaf,
which is a major MSO.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was pretty much the only MSO
at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since then, a few others have moved in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were essentially angel investing
and funding this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the only way we could get it
to go forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They literally never asked anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the nice things about this is it's
a pretty niche, nuanced science.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard to make demands like you
might expect an investor to do if they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't necessarily understand what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more just excited that the
research is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably realistically, it's a
mechanism for them to say, we are
[SPEAKER_04]: supporting research and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never asked us what our progress was.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never asked us what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just very kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by angel investing, that means that
they weren't trying to make a profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing it because they believed
that it was a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can promise you they made no profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They exclusively hemorrhaged money into
that lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, again, because public
university, even though it was still
[SPEAKER_04]: privately funded, everything that was
discovered and published is published in
[SPEAKER_04]: public journals, not given to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They exclusively lost money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this was just a check that they
were comfortable to write and then forget
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be nice to have that type of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully someday I will, and I'll be able
to be an angel investor for good causes
[SPEAKER_01]: like that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an incredible thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were incredibly grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to just take a step back
and ask, the company that you used to work
[SPEAKER_01]: for in cannabis, they told you or they
asked you if you would look into tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you went and did that, but you never
returned back to that company?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I was there, I was incredibly
grateful for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They initially brought me in to help in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the extraction laboratory, but had
asked me to one day do tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how to do that with bacteria,
fungi, all the stuff that I've done in
[SPEAKER_04]: academia, but not plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was what led me, as I mentioned,
to asking Dr. Berkowitz about his lab and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that, and then him asking me to
work there.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he offered that opportunity,
it was incredibly hard to think about
[SPEAKER_04]: returning back to this facility and
knowing that while my opportunity to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: in that facility and in that company was
high, and I believe that they have a
[SPEAKER_04]: really good corporate structure and they
promote from within.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really tantalizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: My capacity to learn would probably have
never been as high as if I had stayed in
[SPEAKER_04]: school and just committed a few more
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately, that's just what I decided
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for a very short period of time,
I would help out at the lab and then do
[SPEAKER_04]: schoolwork, but ultimately, stuck with
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very thankful for making that
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another question I was going to
ask, is you were still considered a
[SPEAKER_01]: student.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't working for the school.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a student, and you were a
graduate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at what point did you stop this
endeavor at the school and take it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next step?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2018, basically, finished up at
UConn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was very poorly planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I was leaving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was set in stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had met with all my committees and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But planning, job hunting, all that type
of stuff, I was so focused on finishing
[SPEAKER_04]: all my research and stuff like that to
make sure that I could just clean slate
[SPEAKER_04]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little short-sighted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got fortunate to help someone with
the grow operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that provided the nest egg to
essentially start economic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as I could, we started it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So within six months, we had some
operating agreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a lease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were off to the races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you started economic,
was the plan to do tissue culture for
[SPEAKER_01]: others or to be a genetic repository,
like you guys are doing with the Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Head?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So initially, it was actually just to do
classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's basically what we did for the
first two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just offering tissue culture
classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come in, we'll show you how to do
micropropagation, show you how to do
[SPEAKER_04]: marist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make media, whatever it is that exceeds
for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at one point, the classes were a
little bit of a premium because
[SPEAKER_04]: self-funded lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the people that were coming into the
classes were people like Skunk VA and
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible individuals in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially, at one point,
I was looking at people that I knew,
[SPEAKER_04]: my rolodex, for lack of a better term,
and was realizing that it was an
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible list of individuals,
an incredible combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once stabilization happened,
the opportunity to expand beyond classes
[SPEAKER_04]: started to conceptualize, forming a
network of people that really understood
[SPEAKER_04]: the plan, really understood the legacy of
the plant, especially within the
[SPEAKER_04]: community, and the genetics of the plant
itself was just, again, yet another
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity that I could not afford to let
slip by.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for a very long time, we had genetics
that were just our own.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never really worried about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would usually just tell people to go to
other fantastic companies with an industry
[SPEAKER_04]: if they were looking for stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were just focused on education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you weren't even doing lab work for
other people, like multiplying their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or cleaning their plants and tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were just doing the classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did consults.
[SPEAKER_04]: We helped people establish their own labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we were doing a lot of tissue
culture work for no one but ourselves,
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially, again, in academia,
to prove something, you really just need
[SPEAKER_04]: three successful plants to show that it
can be done, that you can replicate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the second plant, and that you
can have an average.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the third plant does.
[SPEAKER_04]: In industry, you need to be 95% efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting that level of efficiency and,
again, really just a mind shift,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a lag on me personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So eventually, industry mind kicked in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the opportunity that we were sitting
on finally clicked, leading to where we
[SPEAKER_04]: are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the grateful head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when I spoke to Jason, VA skunk,
about you being on the show, he was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, that's my teacher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't going to name drop him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never know how he likes to roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's out in the public now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know that he goes by Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I think I've outed him
already a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm happy to ride on your coattails
and say that Jason is a fantastic human.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody knows him as Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even when I say Jason, I always have to
say Jason, VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, everyone really knows who we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, he's been telling me about his
tissue culture journey now for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did he study with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a bad clip.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe he took it in 2022.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think I know exactly when he
took it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he took it in June or,
oh man, going backwards in May.
[SPEAKER_04]: May is before June.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he took it one of those two
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because after that, I took an extended
holiday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I came back, our first month in
September, our neighbors, their facility
[SPEAKER_04]: caught on fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they flooded our facility because our
spunker system went off with the smoke,
[SPEAKER_04]: which propped us leaving Western
Massachusetts and moving to Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe he was in the last successful
class.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because quite literally, that fire
happened during the class.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to do Maristem Day at my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he took that, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, Jason, I'm sorry, correct the
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it matters that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I had talked to him after
him doing your class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's setting up his lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll take a minute to tell a little
bit about my tissue culture journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we spoke about it a little bit before
we recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we mentioned Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made the home tissue culture kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: MicroClone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_04]: The MicroClone kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the MicroClone kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my funny story about the MicroClone
kit is, first of all, I knew Bill Graham
[SPEAKER_01]: from before he ever was doing the
MicroClone kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He owned a hydroponics shop in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was called Pure Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also did some wholesale
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me being in the grow shop business,
I knew him for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember also we went to Epcot
Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at Epcot Center, they have this place
called The Land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in The Land, you could buy tissue
culture plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the only place that I've
ever seen that you can buy plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: vitro, in the gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll sell them to you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we bought some redwood trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't remember what else they sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The redwood trees is the one that I really
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, Bill had his MicroClone
kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bought the kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that this is very similar to
what a lot of my clients did, was I bought
[SPEAKER_01]: the kit and I did nothing with it for
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I didn't do it was
because I felt like I needed to be ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really had to just get my head around
the idea of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so literally, I kept the kit for over
a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ingredients might have already been
bad in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day, Bill came to my store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, we're just going to do this
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a retail store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did it right in the middle of our
retail store with the front door opening
[SPEAKER_01]: with a Rubbermaid Toughbox turned on its
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we divided it up, some redwood trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that we divided.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he bought that at Epcot or
if it was something he had was scented
[SPEAKER_01]: geranium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We divided some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unbelievably, it all worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no contamination,
like zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he puts preservatives into
his system or want to make it so that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for someone that had no experience
using scalpels and forceps and the front
[SPEAKER_01]: door opening and just working in this
Rubbermaid Toughbox to see that that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually worked was really inspiring for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at that point, I started doing
tissue culture right there in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of my store every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a two by four grow tent that had
four shelves on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing was just packed with jars
of plants that were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even shared a picture with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put it up in the video of I had,
and it was one of my shockingly proudest
[SPEAKER_01]: plant moments, scented begonia was
blooming in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it was so incredible that
that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: The redwood trees were super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd cut it up into a million pieces,
put it in there, and they would just grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so before you knew it, I had this tent
filled with tissue culture plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, I still hadn't ever done
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to inspire people to
purchase the kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got, you know, I don't know,
maybe a couple of dozen people that
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased the kit and no one used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the very same reason that when I
started my tissue culture journey,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was actually two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one was the intimidation factor,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that stopped people from
doing it was they didn't get the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't helping them now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told people, Hey, look, if you do this
tissue culture, you'll be lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have plants that you can take out
of tissue culture and actually use in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden in six to nine months, because the
sterilization process is super stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they got to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to divide them before you
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because they weren't getting,
I don't want to say immediate
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfaction, but immediate benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally I could say with
confidence, 0% of the people that I sold
[SPEAKER_01]: that kit ever used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one day I went over to my buddy's
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like Bill Graham and said,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because I wasn't growing
cannabis at the time when I had my retail
[SPEAKER_01]: shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, you know, we're going to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did nodal tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it wasn't doing Maristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants kind of looked a little bit
weird, which is something that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like a bit glassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves were like, you know,
like shiny and very transparent and even
[SPEAKER_01]: looking a little bit fragile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the mistake that I made,
and I've actually made this mistake
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple times was I didn't take it to the
next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants would grow into the top of the
jar and eventually they'd start to get
[SPEAKER_01]: damaged because they needed to be,
you know, moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's pretty much where my
tissue culture journey ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never took those plants, divided them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I know that I had already
accomplished the hardest part was
[SPEAKER_01]: sanitizing the plant because, you know,
so I rarely got contamination,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was common that the plants would
get damaged in the sanitization process
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would just never survive,
you know, putting them into the gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never, like I said, I never never
divided them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point I wouldn't have needed
to sanitize them again because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were living in the jar for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is growing in the agar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I don't, you know, so it was just,
again, at this point I wish that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have taken that next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I wanted to say is in talking
with Jason and hearing about the Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Head, and also we have another host on our
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes by Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately he doesn't make his
living in cannabis, you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: his passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a home tissue culture set up,
but he does Maristan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he learned how to do this
on his own by like reading books and
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube videos and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he never used hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just puts it, I believe in the agar and
I forget what this stuff is called musk,
[SPEAKER_01]: muskage or something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but yeah, he doesn't use the hormones
and the plants grow from a Maristan sample
[SPEAKER_01]: into plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess now that I told a little bit of
my story in tissue culture, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: before I do is I want to say is I'm
re-inspired to learn more about tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture because of Cosmic and you and
Jason, VA Skunk and what the Grateful Head
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to continue this journey and I
have a little spot at a friend's house
[SPEAKER_01]: that he's built a tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to share some pictures with you
and with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to learn about it, not because I
want to make it into a business and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll happen someday, but more because I
just want to learn about the product
[SPEAKER_01]: process and I want to be able to preserve
my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I've got to wipe the floor up
a little bit, but this is our little like
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of scuttle room to change in and
right here we'll have a lab fridge set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a rack for tissue
cultures with a bunch of intelligence to
[SPEAKER_00]: call me if there's problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laminar hood, got the mini extra laminar
hood for doing Maristan stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the tissue culture vessels and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be able to fill this all up with
like 200 ball jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be our start starting on next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, while there are other people
doing it, you know, there's places that
[SPEAKER_01]: will bank your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of becomes expensive after a
while, you know, and so for what it costs
[SPEAKER_01]: to bank some genetics, you can,
you know, learn how to do it maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also liked the idea of being in
charge of my own destiny, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to learn about tissue culture
and I noticed, and you know, we'll tell
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that Philip is still doing the
classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go look at his, I'll include
the link on the description, but on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Kenomic Instagram, he has a link tree that
takes you to his website where you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: the services that he provides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, more than happy to, except I'm going
to do something totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to address a bunch of the stuff
that you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the glassy leaves, that's a classic
condition called hyperhidrosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite literally these plants are in
an environment that often when you put
[SPEAKER_04]: them in there, the agar has been poured,
it's cooled and dried and the environment
[SPEAKER_04]: is dry, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you put a plant in there, the agar is
mostly water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this open wound, the plant is going
to start pulling water from the agar and
[SPEAKER_04]: any nutrients, hormones, whatever else is
in that media mix will come into the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it will start transpiring the
water out of the leaves as it produces new
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves and stuff like that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll eventually see condensation
form in your container because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially a humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But humidity domes often allow the
humidity to vent.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a tissue culture, because the container
is often fully sealed, maybe a small vent
[SPEAKER_04]: at the top, you'll reach an equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where there will be saturation of water in
the air leading to condensation,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like it does when you take a hot
shower on your window, on your mirror.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason that it's happening is
because the air has saturation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's looking for somewhere else to
stick and the walls of the container
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't easy to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you use, especially some hormones
like cytokinase and especially TDC,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I know is very commonly used in
cannabis tissue culture, it will promote
[SPEAKER_04]: hyperhidrosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It essentially forces the plant to keep
sucking in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say TDZ or TDT?
[SPEAKER_01]: TDZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the, one of the kits that
I got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm very familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what it'll do is like normally
under regular biological regulation,
[SPEAKER_04]: once you reach saturation, plants will
stop pulling in water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And stop transpiring water, which will
slow down their growth because all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients and all the hormones are in the
water in the agar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the more water they pull through and
push out of their leaves, the more
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients, the more hormones are getting
through them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some hormones can force them to do it
beyond the regular regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically what hormones are
designed to do, are to override
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory, just like adrenaline overrides
your regular normal state of being,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then very quickly has to go away
because you can't live your life on
[SPEAKER_04]: adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd all die of cardiac arrest in the
1930s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like cytokinin, especially TDC,
will continue to force the plant to push,
[SPEAKER_04]: pull in water and push it out,
which leads to hyperhidrosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beyond a saturated level of water and
the plant morphology, especially looks
[SPEAKER_04]: incredibly glassy, not very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Venting helps out lowering your plant
density, helps that just as two very easy
[SPEAKER_04]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was inventing when I first started that,
you know, I didn't even think that that
[SPEAKER_01]: was, was an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last time I did tissue culture,
which was a year ago, I did buy some
[SPEAKER_01]: little stickers that you could drill a
hole in the top of your container and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you put that sticker on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I'm assuming that it was a
combination of both things that the first
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I was venting them, but also at
that point, Bill Graham had like multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: different kits, some that had TDC and then
some that had other hormones in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this last time that I did
it, I didn't have that problem of the
[SPEAKER_03]: glassy leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to distract you.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're totally good.
[SPEAKER_04]: My ADHD rattled mind is never going to be
so good at one topic, but I remember you
[SPEAKER_04]: also mentioned when the plants would hit
the upper threshold of the containers,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So plants have no natural defense or
strategy for an upper limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they're the tallest growing thing in
every environment and except for shade
[SPEAKER_04]: crop and shade crop grows radically
different than a tall growing plant like
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So tall growing plants like cannabis,
they have one plan, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They hit something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They try to bend and grow around basically
at gibberellums upward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you probably saw is they'll hit
it and then they'll start growing like
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to go around.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to sense it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually when it realizes it has nowhere
to go, it will self-top.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will literally necrotize its own apical
node and let the lateral nodes start
[SPEAKER_04]: shooting off because maybe they'll have a
chance to bypass this upper threshold that
[SPEAKER_04]: is preventing it from growing,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When those lateral nodes hit the top and
they also die, usually the whole plant
[SPEAKER_04]: just has no backup being planted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably what you saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably saw it hit the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: This top part just kind of died and looks
sad and the side broke just like a plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: top would go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then eventually the plant doesn't know
what to do anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, what I'll say is the
hardest part of tissue culture is always
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be organogenesis, growing a new
organ out of your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for nodal micropropagation,
that means rooting your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, think about traditional
propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not growing without roots?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that's super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easiest thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think about like a classic plant that
you have right now, a veggie plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You cut it, you dip it in Clon-X 10 days,
14 days from now, there's going to be
roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be roots at the base of a
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did that primordial, original root
cell come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did that initial root cell that made
the second root cell that made a clump of
[SPEAKER_04]: roots, that little white nodule that
eventually made the full-grown root,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that happens every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen your gardens and I can
guess that's what happens because it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: coincidental.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mechanistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the underlying mechanism,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The underlying mechanism is that you are
changing the cellular identity of those
[SPEAKER_04]: branch cells near the injury site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're telling them to stop being
branch cells, become stem cells,
[SPEAKER_04]: quite literally callus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of that callus, because callus
naturally wants to bias towards roots,
[SPEAKER_04]: they root all under the direction of IVA,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The active ingredient Clon-X, NAA,
IAA, whatever oxen you're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in tissue culture, if you don't close
the wound, you can just keep it going
[SPEAKER_04]: indefinitely because you're not growing
new organs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just letting the organs you have
keep producing new ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have already a node.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the node will grow into a branch,
which has many nodes, which can grow into
[SPEAKER_04]: many branches, which will all have many
nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing the roots out of it is the hardest
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why it's the only part of our entire
growth cycle where the plant doesn't grow
[SPEAKER_04]: at all for two weeks, just freaking chills
while it commits all of its metabolic
[SPEAKER_04]: energy to generating a new organ.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once it has that organ,
it starts growing and then your clone
[SPEAKER_04]: grows and then your veg grows and your
flower explodes and growth, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But your clone before roots, it's not
growing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you said, Phil, was really
interesting that growing the roots is the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardest part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree that, you know, when we're not
thinking about tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most magical things that we do
with these plants is take cutting and get
[SPEAKER_01]: them to root.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty incredible thing to do and
make happen and multiply plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for someone and for people that have
been cloning cannabis for many years,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's not the most difficult thing,
but the most amazing thing for us to see
[SPEAKER_01]: is a plant growing without roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I would say classically is like
tissue culture is one of these relatively
[SPEAKER_04]: new techniques, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When once, like you're saying,
once we, anything that isn't normalized is
[SPEAKER_04]: magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once it becomes normalized,
it's just science because it's understood,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like if you were at a party in the year
2000 and you had an aeroclone and you were
[SPEAKER_04]: telling people you cloned in the air,
they'd look at you like you were lying to
[SPEAKER_04]: them or a warlock, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those two.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now if you tell people you cloned in
the air, they'd be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally understand because I've seen a
lot of aerocloners.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no longer magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tissue culture is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like thinking a plant can't survive 20
minutes in bleach and a little bit of soap
[SPEAKER_04]: and then being put into a pressure cook
media is fantastical because it's foreign.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you do it, much like cloning,
it just becomes a job, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like to many people who pursue
gardening as a hobby, they have a
[SPEAKER_04]: radically different relationship than
people who pursue agriculture as a
[SPEAKER_04]: profession.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're growing thousands of plants
rather than a couple of selectable,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think every part of tissue culture is
fascinating when you do it initially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly, seeing the roots in a clear
media that you can just flip over and your
[SPEAKER_04]: plant doesn't fall down and you can see
them growing out of the spiral.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually see the initial injuries
still and see it growing because it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: obstructed by a rock or a cube or some
kind of plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is in itself quite
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think at some point people are
just like, okay, on to the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you've seen it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me still, seeing the plants multiply
itself would no roots over the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just seeing a plant in a jar is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you have that like the movie,
The Biosphere or something where people
[SPEAKER_01]: were living in this jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly before I put the vent on
the container, it's like nothing goes in,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an incredible thing to
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you see it much more, I just
thought it was interesting that you said
[SPEAKER_01]: that the rooting is the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only from a purely biological standpoint,
growing what you have already is pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to keep on eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing something new is incredibly hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just meant, I like to relay it
because we've all cloned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've seen our plant just sit still for
10, 11 days until it roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once it roots, it does what the
plant did before I cut it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after it roots, it just grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I only want to relay that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we go to conventions, when we go to
shows, we bring very pretty rooted plants
[SPEAKER_04]: in the containers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when we move them out of the
container, everybody knows what a plant in
[SPEAKER_04]: bed looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the container, if we're going to a
show or let's say a convention and someone
[SPEAKER_04]: else is selling genetics over there,
it's very easy to be like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: if let's say their genetics are clean,
but someone else walked in with
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially russet mites on their boot or
whatever, they can have access to those
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least our plants are in a completely
enclosed vessel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that provides a level of peace of mind
that is hard to find elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are incredibly fascinated by
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way more than the science.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just like the plant in the container.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's totally OK, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everyone has to know how something
works to appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, that's what you said is
people don't know how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, like when you're in school,
you learn that the plants uptake nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: from the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they bring that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant photosynthesizes and
creates more foliage and shoots and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just taking that step out of the
equation that leaves people going,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I learned that this is the way plants
grow, that they need the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what happens is this is very
common.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember in an early class, we often
hear stuff and we fill in the gaps,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I remember reading in an early
physics class a little bit off of EPAP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was like, OK, two cars hit into
each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you expect to happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: What you expect to happen is they both
bounce back, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's exactly what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now a heavier car, and they both bounce
into each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heavier car, you expect to not go
flying backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lighter car to go flying
backwards, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But explain why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's incredibly hard if you can't
explain the concept of inertia.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you fill in the gap, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You fill in the gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, well, what happens
when I run into a wall really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really fast?
[SPEAKER_04]: I bounce backwards because I have less
inertia than the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people don't think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just fill in the gaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the same happens with tissue
culture or anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I often try to, in my classes,
relate it to conventional or traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: propagation, because it's something that
we're much more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fascination is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a science.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be demystifying it and helping
people understand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, like you, if you want to
pursue it, the more demystified it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: the easier it will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine how hard it would have been to
even do it on your own if Bill had never
[SPEAKER_04]: come by and offered that initial
assistance, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Never would have happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's probably maybe because it seemed
fantastical and very mystical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was intimidating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I very much relate or am empathetic to
people like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we thought the classes would be
as popular as they ended up being,
[SPEAKER_04]: because people do really want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if they don't do it, they at
least want to understand what other people
[SPEAKER_04]: are doing to make the most deliberate
decision for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main reasons why I wanted to do
it back in the day and still want to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue my tissue culture journey is it's
very hard to keep lots of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, if you just have one,
it can be hard to keep that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen many people, including me,
lose valuable genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when Bill showed me, and I just
love the man, whether his kid is perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: or not, I just love the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he inspired me in a lot of ways,
not just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what he showed me was, hey,
look, in one flat, you can have 30 jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you have redundancy,
let's say you have five jars of one
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic, you can have six genetics in a
flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at how many flats can
you have in this 2 by 4 tent that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: with four rows on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this is a way for me to
preserve so many different genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what the Grateful Head is doing is
really great as far as they're holding
[SPEAKER_01]: these genetics and providing it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is nothing negative to say about
the Grateful Head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there have been other companies that
people have paid to store their genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they went out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being able to do this stuff
yourself, to me, is attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, again, you're in charge of your
own destiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we talked about on many
other shows is sharing genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the chem-dog story is how it
was shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it wasn't shared, it wouldn't be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using another place to do tissue
culture as well, and giving cuttings to
[SPEAKER_01]: your friends and people that you know,
I think has value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I want people to leave,
or I'd like people to leave this show
[SPEAKER_01]: with, is an inspiration to learn about
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even though I didn't follow
through, for one reason or another,
[SPEAKER_01]: things happened and I wasn't able to
complete my tissue culture journey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue it forward,
the benefits of growing or using this
[SPEAKER_01]: technology, even if it's just nodal.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, if you don't have viruses,
if you know this, let's say you purchased
[SPEAKER_01]: your clones from Grateful Head and you
know that they don't have the virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: then just keeping them and dividing them
using nodal tissue culture is a great way
[SPEAKER_01]: to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the amount of space that it's
going to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to encourage people to take a
look at not only Bill's class kits,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Phil has these classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you sell kits as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just do classes?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just do classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the ingredients are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think basically what Bill taught you
more than tissue culture is that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: technique over everything, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't need a huge setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our first lab when we started,
it was in a basement of a New England
[SPEAKER_04]: mill, probably one of the dirtiest places
in this world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't matter because we didn't
have to be sterile everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to be sterile in specific moments
and out of the autoplay, in the laminar
[SPEAKER_04]: flow, and everywhere else it's all capped,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the same reason I can bring it to a
show is why I can do it here or there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just adjust it in a pretty
simple way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more self-sufficient you are across
the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a tissue culture specific thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more self-sufficient you are across
the board, the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you love land, it's good to learn how
to grow agricultural crops, food crops,
[SPEAKER_04]: even more than necessarily something like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should learn how to grow food.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should learn how to do basic
maintenance on your car, basic maintenance
[SPEAKER_04]: around the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this is better than calling in a
handyman.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also makes it more applicable that
you'll know when it is appropriate to call
[SPEAKER_04]: in a handyman versus switching out a fuse
yourself versus necessarily needing to
[SPEAKER_04]: rewire something because it's a deeper
issue than that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So knowing knowledge is never the wrong
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always good to be as self-sufficient
as you can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it ultimately comes down to
convenience and price, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason why an oil change is one
of the easiest things you can do on your
[SPEAKER_04]: car.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the least common performed
tasks that people do because it costs $30,
[SPEAKER_04]: $40 for someone to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people would rather the peace of mind
of having a professional do the oil change
[SPEAKER_04]: and if they mess up, whatever liability
that comes is on their hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than if I mess up an oil change and
now my driveway has a beautiful rainbow
[SPEAKER_04]: sheen for the next six months as the oil
just kind of stinks there, I have to deal
[SPEAKER_04]: with it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is always like, if the company goes
out of business and they lose the strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: there honestly might be like pathways that
people can take to at least get some level
[SPEAKER_04]: of, I'm losing the word, but like to get
some value back, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There may be like legal pathways to look
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you lose your strain in your tissue
culture lab, then it's like, that's it,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the best place is like to do an
entailment tandem, ideally, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't have to be some paid
facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you and your friend both learn how to
do tissue culture, backing up each other's
[SPEAKER_04]: plans off site of each other is always
going to be the safest way to ensure it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're saying, it's the reason Chem D
survived was because everyone had the
[SPEAKER_04]: ability to keep it going and its
provenance was never questioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all know what it is and everyone
wants it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly recommend, like I wouldn't,
we be able to do tissue culture if I
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't learn how to do tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us would be able to grow cannabis
if we didn't learn how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if our parents were the greatest
cannabis growers ever, we would still have
[SPEAKER_04]: to learn for us to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tissue culture and much to maybe your
lived experience, it's not rocket surgery.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the hardest thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marestem can be very tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a little bit of a microscope and
working under magnification can be tough
[SPEAKER_04]: because your own movements are magnified.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your movement to the left is 30 times
more to the left now under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, it's just muscle memory.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what growing is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we all have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I highly encourage anyone who has any
interest to learn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Noodle's very beginner-friendly,
especially if you have any experience with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to cloning, just on a
much smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something else that always concerned
me about tissue culture that I think was
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the reason why I never made the
full-on jump to it was I was scared that,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I can have these genetics in tissue
culture, but because it was still foreign
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, I felt like I still had to keep the
mumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was scared like, man, these things,
they could get contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could die, and then I lose the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that if I keep these mother
plants, I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The golden rule for data backup is three
to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three copies, two different medias,
one off-site.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three copies can be you, your buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of yours is in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is a mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an analog backup and a digital
backup, for lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then your buddy is the third copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's off-site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anything happens in your facility,
you can always get the genetics back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do that, particularly when
you get more and more genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, space is ultimately the name of
the game, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that's where, for many
cultivators, you clean up your plants only
[SPEAKER_04]: once.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your SOPs are good, you don't
necessarily need to be doing Maristem
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle after cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should just have a clean mom,
and then now you have a clean mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop getting it dirty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for many cultivators, it's exactly what
you're describing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a space thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have sentimental or non-commercially
viable but still valuable plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they need some way of storing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I still recommend keeping a mom
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that takes away one of the big
advantages that I mentioned of tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, is that you're able to keep so
many genetics in a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I have to do that and then still
have another space to keep the moms,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that whole advantage is... I would
change it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now, let's say you've got
three strains, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got multiple moms per strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually at least one's maybe a little bit
smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're keeping the lineage going,
and one is being cannibalized for the
[SPEAKER_04]: round of cuttings or propagates that are
being made, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: In tissue culture scenario, you would keep
a single mom alive, literally just to be
[SPEAKER_04]: the backup nodal donor if it comes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ideally, that mom came from a Maristem
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know it's clean and you never cut
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's never gonna be introduced to
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's ever getting in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just in a corner somewhere growing,
never needed, and maybe once every other
[SPEAKER_04]: month it gets cloned down, or a fresh one
out of TC comes out to replace it,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But in tissue culture, you are
multiplying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you are making more copies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your cloning step.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're rooting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're producing clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are basically replacing the entire mom
stage in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will just keep a single mom as an
analog backup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's a little bit of a larger
footprint for a strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's still considerably smaller
than what many facilities are running.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now five moms per strain so that they can
meet their threshold run.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many clones they need?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So throughput in tissue culture is very,
very easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main thing you see it being used for
in industry outside of Canada is
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial agricultural tissue culture is
purely for production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like seedless watermelon, they're
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seedless grapes, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're seedless.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get a second generation from
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to give you any seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the easiest way to propagate them in
the high density that's needed to reseed
[SPEAKER_04]: all the fields for the next generation is
through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And seedless watermelon, all the plants
that you can buy at your local hardware
[SPEAKER_04]: store, if they sell them like mums or
stuff like that, at Home Depot or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, all of those start from tissue
culture and then eventually make their way
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for propagation, cultivation scale,
it's an immaculate tool for this large
[SPEAKER_04]: scale cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sasha, I know I interrupted you before
when you were asking the questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: so go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both have so many questions for Phil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we can... Actually, I have to
tell you, I have a facility of mother
[SPEAKER_02]: plants also here in Austria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's next to Slovenia where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the same thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I and Gabi, when we met, we started
to talk and both of us have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those is definitely the one
that we are both dealing with the thoughts
[SPEAKER_02]: about starting a tissue culture technique
because we are getting older.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us in this industry, we have to
keep up the genetics for years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are sometimes the only one that
has a particular cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are actually begging other people to
keep it also, but you know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something that is maybe only valuable
to me right now, maybe will be valuable in
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years to many, many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Gabi mentioned the camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly this kind of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is that you realize when you
work with plants, a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's a particular cut that you
work with every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you keep it like really in the
perfect shape and the traditional cloning
[SPEAKER_02]: works, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem gets when you start to get
this kind of, you know, when the cut's
[SPEAKER_02]: getting like 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can keep it up just for a
certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, because I was
listening to Skong the Ace podcast last
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told about his end of fights,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not the virus that I hope
latent virus, but there is this so much
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to ask you before this
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I cut from a healthy mom, let me say
healthy, not not populated, but it has all
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of other stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I don't even know to name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a marriage stem from a cut and I
culture it and I do then these nodule cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it be clean immediately or is there
is a chance also that the virus is already
[SPEAKER_02]: in the tissue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or so like the, the reality is it's like,
how much nuance do we want to jump into?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what does clean really mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pops like an environment isn't new.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, we care about it now because
all the other stuff that we already knew
[SPEAKER_04]: about, we can handle, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No one cares about pops like an
environment when you've got russet mites
[SPEAKER_04]: because russet mites kill your operation
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pops like an environment is a generational
prolonged annoyance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, but the reason why is because
like russet mites may be super devastating
[SPEAKER_01]: to your plants right away, but we do have
some ideas on how to handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The average person can do it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we used to not know what to do with
it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it kills your cycle immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you mill do kills your cycle
immediately?
[SPEAKER_04]: No one cares about how amazing your veg
was when you've got powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_04]: flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one cares about how amazing your grow
is when you've got batrides misery.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of these, because they're way more
pertinent have solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: They needed solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We needed to figure out how to stop russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: We needed to figure out how to stop
powdery mildew because there would be no
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pops like an environment is progressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's opportunistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason it can thrive now is because we
can handle everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now the next kid on the block,
like biology is a game of finding energy
[SPEAKER_04]: resources and dominating them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And plants are an incredible energy
resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say we let's say we do Maristem,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a classic question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I'm going to get into the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maristems aren't sterile.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are infected by other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mitoviruses have been shown to infect
cannabis Maristems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard of Mitoviruses before
this, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because who has who cares?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does clean mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean means I want my plants to produce,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that stops my plant from
producing means it's not clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Pops and Viroid is now the newest
version of the plant not being clean,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though it's probably been around for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not named cannabis latent Viroid,
and it's not called Pops after Viroid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a latent Viroid from a different
species.
[SPEAKER_04]: To jump species takes a lot of
evolutionary time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be latent, it takes a lot of and
then to be actually shown takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolic energy, just like for humans
showing herpes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a latent virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hides and only shows up when your
immune system is complicated with some
[SPEAKER_04]: other illness, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it goes away and then like hops
is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fantastic perspective that you
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for this, because I was thinking
the same and I'm not I was thinking I was
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking is I'm the only one that says
hope latent is already been there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, was people look at me and say,
oh, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me pose it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a garden that's got hops and
Viroid and racemites, and there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: solution to either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one do you care more about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Racemites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't care about it far more
devastating, far quicker, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And generationally, if you don't get rid
of them and you put more plants in the
[SPEAKER_04]: room, they're right there again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has the exact same threat of pops,
but like in the immediacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have miticides and sulfur sprays and
all of these from holistic to
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical grade solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hops does not have that level of
solution yet or sophistication yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so I mean, literally Maristem is
surgical isolation.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like saying like, you know,
we have a blood brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many pathogens cannot cross it as the
physical barrier to prevent things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Syphilis doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets right into your brain and wrecks
havoc.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, because nothing else can co
infect your brain or struggles,
[SPEAKER_04]: it has free reign.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the Maristem is like we isolate the
Maristem.
[SPEAKER_04]: We isolate a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mitoviruses nobody cares about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe in the future, what every plant
is from Maristem and we essentially just
[SPEAKER_04]: hyper proliferated these viruses or
virids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they will cause issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, much like hops and Viroid,
when you have powdery mildew, you consider
[SPEAKER_04]: pops and Viroid to be basically
asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think like, you know, to go back to
Sasha, your initial question, if you go
[SPEAKER_04]: from Maristem and you successfully isolate
that tissue, you have successfully cleared
[SPEAKER_04]: up the systemic pathogens we currently
care about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But biology won't be static.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 10 years from now, there may be
tomato latent Viroid or tobacco mosaic
[SPEAKER_04]: Viroid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like literally all of, you know,
and the more crops that are grown and the
[SPEAKER_04]: more landmass that is grown with it,
this type of cross speciation of
[SPEAKER_04]: pathogens, you know, is more likely.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of monoculture also in that
traditional sense, where there is too much
[SPEAKER_02]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all monoculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things progress in monoculture,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why people wanted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, you're talking about
monoculture, but I understand that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in a lot of European sections,
it's mostly either hybridized greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: or all outdoor crops, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the United States, it's indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So imagine indoor monoculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute any pathogen gets in there,
it's wildfire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that pathogen has no natural
predators to prevent it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there are no natural predators for
Russet mites in my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are outdoors, but when I grow the
plant in my house, the Russet mites get
[SPEAKER_04]: in, they are going to run wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, sin for everything too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So tissue culture is invaluable in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if yeah, if your pathogens that you're
dealing with are non-systemic,
[SPEAKER_04]: nodalist is super good.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your pathogens are systemic,
Maristem is the best we have right now
[SPEAKER_04]: because it has a maristematic barrier,
just like we have a blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will physically prevent certain
microbes and pathogens to get in there
[SPEAKER_04]: from like facarium to hopsite and viral.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, to say it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess in the end, it's far better to
start with Maristem anyway, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know the systemic issues that you
have, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So why risk it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you guys probably have a
quarantine area because why risk it
[SPEAKER_04]: already, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the quarantine area is only going
to tell you about stuff that you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was like the Maristem is the
quarantine area on steroids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not quarantining the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're quarantining the section of the
plant that won't have the microbes,
[SPEAKER_04]: even if it didn't have it or even if it
did have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because you know that you're
quarantining that section, what results
[SPEAKER_04]: from that section is totally kosher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the resulting plant, you can be less
nervous of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you should certainly still test
and testing services are out there to help
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Maristem is the way to start if
you run a digital trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as far as testing,
it's kind of like cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only test for certain things that we
know about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may not be able to test for certain
systemic issues that we don't know exist,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're testing for Fasarium and stuff
like that, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what about like Hythium,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like much to your point.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reality is like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's even bleaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, it's bleaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: For many things that we can test,
I mean, the test is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got Fasarium, it's a fun guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: A DNA based test is very reliable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who goes on to a reality TV show to
find out if they are or aren't a dad,
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't start arguing with a genetics test
because DNA is pretty concrete evidence of
[SPEAKER_04]: an organism, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, for example, the Hobsla
environment testing is a lot trickier,
[SPEAKER_04]: but people demand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone feels like they have to,
but it's almost like security at the
[SPEAKER_04]: airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's security theater rather than actual
security.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not necessarily probably at the
airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works even better still.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would argue like you could make that
argument that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of the testing that's offered
is really just to placate the minds of the
[SPEAKER_04]: people who are doing it rather than to get
a genuine test and then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a genuine test is much harder said
than done to, you know, for something
[SPEAKER_04]: again for Fasarium, for powdery mildew,
for resin mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very easy to get a reputable
test and not worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some other things that people care
about a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to take a quick flashback in
time for me, when I used to own the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: spout and people would come in with some
type of plant problem, it was very common
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so common it would happen multiple
times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would say, I think I have tobacco
mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I'm saying this is
because I wanted to ask you what you
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just felt any time there was a
problem that they didn't know what it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were saying it's tobacco mosaic
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I think people are doing the same
thing with hop latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they're not doing the testing,
they're like, oh, this plant is,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Gabby, as an amazing,
as an amazing judge of character,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you accidentally stumbling into
something closer to a human condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you are growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plant is growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are two realities, either the
environment and exterior outside world is
[SPEAKER_04]: messing your plant, or you are messing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's much easier for people who have
egos and who have like defensive
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanisms to blame anything other than
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my plant is messed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never been messed up before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be the nutrients that have never
been messed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be the soil that's ever been
messed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be the viroid or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, most illnesses have obvious
characteristics, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there are generalized immune
responses in plants, just like we have
[SPEAKER_04]: generalized immune responses with getting
a fever, maybe feeling uneasy,
[SPEAKER_04]: going to the bathroom, like no matter what
gets us sick, those are the first things
[SPEAKER_04]: our body wants us to do to get a fever,
feel uneasy, go to the bathroom,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether if they are overwatered,
they, they wilt.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're underwater, they wilt.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have generalized responses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when people see a generalized
response, I think they just want to
[SPEAKER_04]: ascribe it to something other than my
fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reality is probably like it wasn't
tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's infection of cannabis is relatively
rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if these are like indoor growers going
to a hydroponics shop, then they probably
[SPEAKER_04]: are not interacting with tobacco
frequently enough to be interacting with
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, live tobacco, not,
not like smokable tobacco, but live
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco that's got the virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just readily transmitting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then depending on what part of the
country you're in, it might not even be
[SPEAKER_04]: hospital to grow tobacco in that part of
the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there might not be any tobacco for
hundreds of miles from Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only tobacco they grow is in
greenhouses because they can make the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves very, very big, perfect for
rolling, but they don't grow any smokable
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you had TMV, here, it would be,
you know, quite a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I was, you know, because kind of
like hoplite and viroid, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: blame their problems on hoplite and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoplite and viroid does exist,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought tobacco mosaic virus did
exist in cannabis and that's, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why this had been happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as an education for me in the
world, do you know, cause you just said
[SPEAKER_01]: that it would spread via fresh tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can't be spread like if somebody's
holding a cigarette, that's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always tell people, you smoke,
you gotta, I mean, you gotta clean your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably should anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, for me, it was a confirm,
uh, like to just potentially make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're not spreading any, you know,
virus or disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like there has been a lot of,
it was for the public good.
[SPEAKER_04]: To tell people about spreading germs and
washing your hand because the public
[SPEAKER_04]: should wash their hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's just a good advice to get
people right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there was a lot of miss or a
lot of emphasis put about how
[SPEAKER_04]: transmittable certain things are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I remember growing up and watching
this video where someone put like blue
[SPEAKER_04]: paint on their hand and then every
doorknob they touch and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, but like how hospitable
to a microbe is a metal doorknob?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, they're on there, but are they
growing on there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I touching that doorknob two later,
two hours later?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's now still a living aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might, you know, that's a very
compelling reason to wash our hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like, no, the viruses,
they're not, but they can very simply be
[SPEAKER_04]: thought of as like, uh, got like,
um, parasites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they need other cellular machinery from
a donor to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't just, I mean, they can survive
in the environment, but they can't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily live in the environment,
drive in the environment for a very long
[SPEAKER_04]: time until applicable hosts get some dead
tobacco tissue that's been processed and
[SPEAKER_04]: probably been like infused with some
glycerin and stuff to make it more
[SPEAKER_04]: smokable and easier to also look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that you probably have a
higher risk of like catching, I don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: to go controversial.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably are very safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, if you have a field next to a
tobacco field and cannabis likes very
[SPEAKER_04]: similar environmental conditions that
tobacco likes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like to say in certain
countries where they could grow both that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're growing both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could definitely see TMV, uh,
and it has some very unique variegation
[SPEAKER_04]: style morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're just like a, if you're a
home grower in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's probably very rare that you have TMV.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a home grower in the great north
of Maine, it's probably rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Georgia, it's a more
compelling argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else that I was really
interested in and Sasha, please interrupt
[SPEAKER_01]: me if you have any questions because I
have so many questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not be giving you any time,
but, um, I saw on your website and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard on, so I was actually a part of a,
um, tissue culture group on Facebook and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all like regular plants, not
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I'm sure, you know,
the company, uh, plants sell technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell, um, you know, ingredients for
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they were talking about synthetic
seeds and I saw synthetic seeds on your,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, on your website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please tell people, tell people about
synthetic seeds because I can't be the
[SPEAKER_01]: only one that doesn't know much about
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, we can make a gel, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the agar is that we,
uh, put it in tissue coach, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally what we do is we make the gel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We pour that gel into a container and when
it cools, it solidifies and then it
[SPEAKER_04]: becomes the gel that you can tap and you,
it's a solid, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas synthetic seed is says it's like,
why don't we just put the plant in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of that gel and then we put the gel
around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a real seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, uh, new tissue that's made from
two parents and the result of pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't germinate it like a seed,
you don't crack it like a seed all like
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a seed in that it's around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, most of the time in industry and a lot
of like, uh, academic lab, they don't go
[SPEAKER_04]: for that aesthetic route.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just encapsulate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally they make the seed, the capsule,
they put the note in the capsule,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever shape it is, whatever shape it
naturally made because it's a chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when two chemicals interact,
it immediately makes that hardening of the
[SPEAKER_04]: shell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, how it works is in traditional
tissue culture, you put all your nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: and hormones into the agar and then the
agar solidifies as it cools in a synthetic
[SPEAKER_04]: seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put all of your nutrients into the
solution and the solution will naturally
[SPEAKER_04]: solidify when it comes into contact with
the summit second chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not about cooling down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens at room temperature versus like
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you put the media, it has to still be
warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and yeah, they call it a synthetic
seed because the plant isn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: actively growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can store it fair for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has some similarities.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, functional way as a seed,
but like, it's not going to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: taproot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to have any of that type of
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks immaculate in pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool science fiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is this something that,
cause so for instance, out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of people that will grow
seasonally and they take the winter off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people that are not growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something that actually could be
used for?
[SPEAKER_01]: For them?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, so from this, you still have to
do the tissue culture process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it more complicated than if you were to
do tissue culture right out of the gate?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's a, it's literally no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you were, you're encapsulating a
node and then you're storing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you break that storage at
dormancy, you're just doing nodal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what it really is for is like,
let's say I wanted to get some genetics to
[SPEAKER_04]: Sasha, even shipping stuff in tissue
culture could be very, uh, temperamental
[SPEAKER_04]: to the temperature outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because in tissue culture,
the nutrients and hormones are still
[SPEAKER_04]: promoting growth growth under stressful
conditions, like the below freezing
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures that it currently is means
that you'll get messed up morphology or
[SPEAKER_04]: more commonly often death because,
uh, synthetic seeds are about stasis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can ship them somewhere that will take a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can get caught up in customs and then
eventually make it to his doorstep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if he, you know, can do nodal on
them, he can germinate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll have, you know, the longer they
stay, the lower germination rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be just a traditional seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great way of transporting
genetics to someone on the other end that
[SPEAKER_01]: can do nodal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is essentially how all tissue culture
organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even saying plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically how they're all sent.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sent in culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they can survive in a Petri dish,
they'll survive in a Petri dish,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if they can't, they'll usually be sent
in some kind of suspension.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant version of that suspension is a
synthetic seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you're doing is super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, something that I mentioned earlier
before and wanted to make sure to get back
[SPEAKER_01]: to was, um, well, first of all,
let me tell a story that someone else
[SPEAKER_01]: tells and this is, um, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tells a story about how he bought a
bunch of plants that were tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and that, you know, it was
thousands of plants at a giant farm in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Palm desert or somewhere down in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that he had a massive
incidence of hermaphrodism and he felt
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was because of the hormones that
are used in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddy, the cosmic, not because of
that, but just because of lack of knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: how to, you know, mix the hormones or,
you know, the fear of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just does nodal tissue culture with the
MS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it's called?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the disadvantage that I see is that
the plants root and they kind of grow like
[SPEAKER_01]: a regular plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you use the growth hormone,
for instance, you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: multiplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get more shoots, but you know,
I'm trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm thinking about like what he's
doing, I say, well, maybe this is less
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to cause a problem, um,
because he's not using these hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if he doesn't have the advantage of,
of being able to get it to multiply as
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is honestly more a broad question
about hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're used.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're function.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we, how do we navigate it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we don't really, you know,
we're not plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't use the IPA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how much is the right amount of IPA
versus how much is going to get you
[SPEAKER_04]: adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing we're always trying to not get
any side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we started in Massachusetts,
Massachusetts, similar to Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_04]: non-agricultural state, um, that
aforementioned plant, maybe I talked about
[SPEAKER_04]: like an hour and a half ago, Aronia is
grown primarily in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, it's a tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes juice that makes cranberries
taste sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I have it here at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful tree in terms of like,
you know, uh, they sell pills of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like very healthy for stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's like a novelty thing where,
you know, you eat it and then you try
[SPEAKER_01]: other foods and they taste completely
different and sour stuff will take sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's called like miracle
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know a lot of people like that
because it's a red fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very high in antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're someone who like really
believes in oxidative stress, then it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it makes a lot of sense to like it,
but it's not very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, Massachusetts did not have a
strong agricultural program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so when they legalized cannabis in
2016, what they did was they copied the
[SPEAKER_04]: USDA rules for organic horticulture
blindly one to one.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't revise anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just copy pasted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is now their hemp program guidelines,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the USDA organics guidelines say you
could do a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use salt fertilizers, you can grow
in rock or you can do whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing you can't do is use
synthetic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that will make an organic
grow, not organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite things to talk about is
that IBA is often synthetic and oxens and
[SPEAKER_04]: high doses are herbicidal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in, it is by the USDA's definition
and in the state of Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_04]: IBA is a synthetic pesticide.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot use, you can't use it in a
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't use it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't clone with clone X.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't clone with form it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't think maybe they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just hidden, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because let me tell you, you can test for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When, when, uh, when they were doing an
audit in like 2018 or something like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: they found it in a facility, like a $4
million already licensed facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pulled their license.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't suspend it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't, they revoked it after they
had gone like three, four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, so like, it was one of
those, like they led by example.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most other facilities,
especially because Massachusetts has
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially a 2 million entry,
like dollar per entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you're supposed to use it in
California either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone uses it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's all about how, so some
states, they, you know, they legalize it
[SPEAKER_04]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, you know, if you use it as a
plant growth regulator, it's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use it as a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a pesticide and they'll ban the
usage and sometimes dosages, but some
[SPEAKER_04]: states will just, you know, blindly ban
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the approach to Massachusetts,
which means when we started in
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts, because it was legal in
Connecticut, it wasn't, which is why I
[SPEAKER_04]: moved there and started in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't use hormones and we didn't use
hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant doesn't need hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the plant has all of the genetic
code and resources and tools to build
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever you initially had that we removed
from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just needs building blocks,
nutrients, literally just NPK,
[SPEAKER_04]: some micronutrients, some vitamins,
and it'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hormones are where it gets complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually what I do in my classes when I
talk about this stuff is I stop talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I start talking about people because it's
way easier for us to understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference between nutrients and hormones,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of us can eat roughly the same diet
in terms of grams of carbs, protein,
[SPEAKER_04]: proteins, and fats, and total calories.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all eat roughly the same diet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll all be roughly healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Few people, obviously, by percentage have
metabolic disorders.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need tailored diets, but generally
diet is very generalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hormones are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, that motherfucker who is younger than
me, is taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: If me, when we were teenagers,
if we both took HGH to be the same height,
[SPEAKER_04]: if we took the same amount, I might be
taller and he might be too tall still,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a dose of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we took too low amount, he might be
taller and I might get cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hormones are extreme signaling profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, think about guys who are now
beyond that age of pubescence and are now
[SPEAKER_04]: like in their thirties or forties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't feel like you're 22
anymore, but if you get a dose of
[SPEAKER_04]: testosterone, testosterone patch,
or HRT therapy, you will feel,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll have energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your muscles will recover.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will have the appetite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your hair will start regrowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your voice will get deeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your memory will be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those things are directed by your
dose of testosterone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all those things spike when you
get a testosterone dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you get further away from that
injection or patch, you get back to your
[SPEAKER_04]: normal dose, like level of performance,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hormones are incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're incredibly specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a lot of diet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with, I mean, like you can look all
over Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at people who are doing tissue
culture and their formulations aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: right, you'll get cancerous looking
calluses that are three times,
[SPEAKER_04]: four times, eight times the size of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is clearly not directed growth of a
regenerative plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is runaway growth, which in biology
is the literal definition of cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is growth that has bypassed the
checkpoint to stop and just keeps growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as long as you give cancer food,
sugar, which often, if you guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you've made the media,
is in these nutrients, they'll keep
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hormones can lead to all the difference
in the world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They can make plants look phenotypically
different after tissue culture when you
[SPEAKER_04]: transplant them.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we just posted some pictures of
super silver haze, the lost phenol,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is incredibly, I hate using this
term, but I'm going to use it because I
[SPEAKER_04]: know it's industry standard, incredibly
sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not even hybridized.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just straight up basically a sativa
and, or for phenotypic reasons,
[SPEAKER_04]: a narrow leaf plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at the picture,
its leaves are much broader because it
[SPEAKER_04]: just came out of tissue culture and the
hormones, I mean, cytokinins have
[SPEAKER_04]: incredible impacts on leaf morphology and
stuff like that in terms of keeping them
[SPEAKER_04]: green for longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Controlling something that's called
programmable time death, which is what the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves do when it's winter, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They all fall off the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not continental.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mechanism called senescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cytokinins influence that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So out of tissue culture, the leaves of
the super silver haze are much broader
[SPEAKER_04]: than you would expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know in like a month or two,
as it gets farther and farther away from
[SPEAKER_04]: its tissue culture and hormonal
experience, it will return to its natural
[SPEAKER_04]: hormonal balance and its natural levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fan leaves will fin out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something that we see across
the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually why we've posted the jam it
on six because it maintained extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: narrow leaves throughout tissue culture,
which is extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the most narrow leaves that
we've ever seen, which means it might be
[SPEAKER_04]: the most truest sativa we've ever worked
with through TC because it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: pretend like hormones don't impact stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is like undeniable to your buddies
or to the story that you were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Inheriting these plants and then them
permafridating out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really depends on what hormones are
because hormones have a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, Clon-X comes in a dark bottle
with 99.7% of it is not IVA.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stabilizing ingredients because IVA
is very light sensitive, which is why it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes in a dark bottle and very
temperature sensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't just willy nilly have it in
your grow room like you have a bottle of
[SPEAKER_04]: something else because it'll eventually
degrade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you've got a bottle of very
expensive water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would expect that plants that leave
tissue culture will 100% return to their
[SPEAKER_04]: true phenotype whenever those hormones get
processed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some hormones, especially synthetic
hormones, are way more stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're used, the phenotypic
plasticity might last much longer than if
[SPEAKER_04]: other hormones were used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that might have been what he was
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, and I don't want to call it a
mistake, but I guess what what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying happened was or saying is that
these plants are much better used as
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plants than straight stock to
immediately put in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have a very critical standpoint
on hermaphroditus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in cannabis, it's always the growers
fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always the growers fault because it's not
a genetic trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an environmental trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, and that's not to say like,
look, if you're growing 100 strains in one
[SPEAKER_04]: room, it's impossible to have all 100
strains have the optimized environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to pick some temperatures
that some like, some humidities that some
[SPEAKER_04]: don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you stress the wrong ones too far,
that's what they'll do because that's what
[SPEAKER_04]: a dying plant that can become male does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It chooses to say it tries to save its
genetic DNA is selfish and it's way easier
[SPEAKER_04]: to propagate your DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole point of living from a
biological standpoint, I'm saying as
[SPEAKER_04]: someone who has no kids and no interest in
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a biological standpoint,
that is the game plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's your plan to survive,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just enjoy my life with the wonderful
people I have, you know, and I know many
[SPEAKER_04]: wonderful family members that have kids,
many wonderful friends that have kids and
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish them all the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think knowing what you should do and
knowing what you shouldn't do is a
[SPEAKER_04]: strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think you probably have a lot to
offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you'd be a better parent than
a lot of the people out there that I hope
[SPEAKER_04]: to offer it to again, my loved ones and
friends and to keep expanding on those
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope Sasha and I are part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happening in real time, friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's literally the best part of these
podcasts is the friends that we're making.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot, he didn't finish answering the
question about using hormones or not using
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cosmic does not use the hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting them to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should use hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reality is the plant will grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like in Massachusetts, if you clone
in an aerocloner, and you just put water
[SPEAKER_04]: in there that's pHed correctly,
and you just spritz it onto the base,
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually it'll callus, eventually it'll
root, but those roots will be wimpier.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be thinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be more prone to developing the
sheath, a little melanation, a little
[SPEAKER_04]: yellowing that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hormones are growth promoters,
at least the ones that we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very broad term.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hormone is literally just a messenger
that works, a messenger molecule that
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only thing that separates a
hormone from a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a lot of a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a good amount of sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need very little adrenaline to get
your heart pumping.
[SPEAKER_04]: From that perspective, there are lots of
hormones, some synthetic, that only exists
[SPEAKER_04]: in labs, some natural, and their wide
appeal can be utilized in ways that have
[SPEAKER_04]: no detrimental effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people who are doing tissue
culture, they use hormones to keep their
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flower plants from auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just photoperiod plants until they
remove the hormones from their diet,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they auto flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: For them, for their propagator reasons,
it's very, very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: For someone who is inheriting someone
else's work and doesn't necessarily know
[SPEAKER_04]: the history that these plants have gone
through, yeah, it's certainly a risk to
[SPEAKER_04]: just put those plants directly into
flower, but I think it would be a risk to
[SPEAKER_04]: put them into flower outside of tissue
culture if you just inherit your body's
[SPEAKER_04]: garden for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe less about herniation, although that
could still happen if you don't validate
[SPEAKER_04]: the plants before you just flower a room
with them, and more so with russet mites
[SPEAKER_04]: or powdery mildew, just like what we
talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, again, I think it's more
what you said before, that it was probably
[SPEAKER_01]: something that the cultivators did,
because this company doesn't sell plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell, I'm not going to mention the
nursery's name, but I'm sure you'll know
[SPEAKER_01]: who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell plants in flats that have tiny
little organic plugs, and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic wrap over the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: The vented wrap, I know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, again, hermaphrodism is
always the grower's fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not be the end-grower's fault if
you're inheriting a plant from someone
[SPEAKER_04]: else, but it is not a genetic trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree that there are some plants
that tend to be more sensitive than
[SPEAKER_01]: others?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yeah, prone, yeah, that's fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, take your most feminine plant,
literally the most feminine plant you've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever had that would never hermaphrodite
under any circumstances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spray that with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spray with colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colloidal silver and silver thiosulfate
are not DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not impregnating.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not genetically modifying the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're shutting off certain regulatory
aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant must still have the DNA to then
produce pollen sacs if it's then going to
[SPEAKER_04]: produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pollen sacs, and of course it will
because, again, it's not coincidental.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mechanistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis can at any time produce pollen
sacs if the environmental conditions are
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it thinks it has to survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and it's your job if you don't want
pollen sacs on your plants to not put
[SPEAKER_04]: those plants in those conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might genuinely require you growing
less susceptible plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's really like, just like
people, some people handle stress very
[SPEAKER_04]: gracefully, and some people handle stress
not as gracefully, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a stress thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stress is universal.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants have to be grown in an
environment, so the cultivator has to
[SPEAKER_04]: decide what environment it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you had mentioned about the cancer of
the callus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that can be remedied
with time as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you have a plant that's just like
that, or is that something that should
[SPEAKER_01]: just get, excuse me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean cancer is runaway growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remove it from its source,
and it'll stop, and then put it into a
[SPEAKER_04]: more appropriate source.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll cut it off?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability for, this is like really,
really nuanced molecular biology,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is called epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants' ability to differentiate,
to go from a stem cell into any type of
[SPEAKER_04]: mature cell type, and de-differentiate to
go back, is almost universal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can go back and forth, and back and
forth, and from one to another,
[SPEAKER_04]: and back into another, and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why when you cut maybe a leaf
close to where you're cloning,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll see a root come out of the damaged
petiole, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe sometimes you see, those cells
change their identity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes if you see vines,
they'll grow out of the ground where the
[SPEAKER_04]: roots, they become shoots, and then
they'll touch the ground again,
[SPEAKER_04]: and where they touch the ground,
more shoots grow out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can go back and forth,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants have extreme plasticity,
and the hormones regulate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you change the hormones,
you just stop the cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's radically different than,
obviously, my mailing perspective of
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer, where we're not plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once something converts from one type
of maturity to another, it's extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: hard for us to stop it, and to get it to
another type, or to something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants don't have that issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just remove it from your
cancer-reducing media, change the
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients around the hormones,
you can put the same plant right back in
[SPEAKER_04]: there, and see if the callus will behave
more appropriately, and if you'll get more
[SPEAKER_04]: normal morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to have to let you go in
a couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One question I would ask, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this one, because this is really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 cultivars you are having in Grateful
Head project.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you maintain, is this like the same
agar for all of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because we are talking about the
load of hormones in particular cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cultivars like this, some cultivars
like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you maintain 500 cuts in tissue?
[SPEAKER_04]: What we initially did was, okay,
you know what a Venn diagram is,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you have the two overlapping rings?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like two circles, where this is
distinct, this is distinct, but the
[SPEAKER_04]: overlap shares, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think of the Olympic rings as five
sets of overlapping diagrams, where
[SPEAKER_04]: they're all distinct, but also have some
similarity to their neighbor, that's how
[SPEAKER_04]: we started.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had five different medias, and what we
did was we stopped presuming we would know
[SPEAKER_04]: what the plant wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would blindly put it into every shotgun
approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw everything at the wall and
whatever's stuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where our next level of
optimization would go from, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been very fortunate to have worked
with quite a number of cultivars at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point, that we actually do have a
universal media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just do one media for everything,
just like the cultivators that I was so
[SPEAKER_04]: critical of growing all the same strains
in one room, and then potentially some
[SPEAKER_04]: from apprehending out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some will like that one media more than
others.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of them have shown in our experience,
and there's always the next plant to prove
[SPEAKER_04]: me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But thankfully, this media has worked
exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If ever comes a time where a plant doesn't
like that media, we fortunately have this
[SPEAKER_04]: wide shotgun approach to fall back to,
but as you can presume, for optimization's
[SPEAKER_04]: sake, it's incredibly hard to make five
different teams for your plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: or five different nutrient compositions,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did focus quite a year and a half on
optimizing to a single media.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very thankful to have thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something I was thinking about,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that Sasha brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to say that, as with most of our
podcasts, we've spoken now for over two
[SPEAKER_01]: hours and I know that we haven't scratched
the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like the long form format here,
so I hope we can get you to come back and
[SPEAKER_01]: continue the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to ask you about possibly
joining, Wolf has another podcast on our
[SPEAKER_01]: network called The Way We Grow,
and maybe just doing, because that show is
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot shorter, it's like an hour,
but basically maybe just giving a basic
[SPEAKER_01]: rundown of tissue culture, different ways
people can do it, more for the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say entry level,
but just to inspire people, because I do
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that it's a valuable tool,
like all the other tools that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we do go, I don't think we talked
enough about the Grateful Head,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you became involved with them,
what your position is with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've had other guests like Kevin and
Mark, so hopefully our audience is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit familiar that you guys are a
repository for genetics and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: preserving them and you're selling Gen
Zero clones, which are probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanest clones you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not be sanitized, as we discussed
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how'd you get involved with that
project, and I'm sure you're very excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got, I think most of the members,
maybe that you've talked to, were pulled
[SPEAKER_04]: in by a guy named Steve, and I was pretty
unique in that they had a relationship
[SPEAKER_04]: with the lab already, and for whatever
reason, there was a falling out in that
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship, and because they believed in
the goal that they set out to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: they looked for another lab, and there's
not many tissue culture labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a number of labs in tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're most often vertically integrated
into a grow facility, often into an MSO,
[SPEAKER_04]: the state operator.
[SPEAKER_04]: So being a third party and getting your
genetics into their hands and allowing
[SPEAKER_04]: them to clean them up is often very hard,
not only from potentially a trust
[SPEAKER_04]: situation, but really just from will they
even do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jason reached out to me, because we had
the relationship with the class,
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically asked if we wanted to be a
part of it, and it was such an amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way that we didn't want to be
a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumped right on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty amazing collection of guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like many startups.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredibly fast-paced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things feel like they're changing all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, on my end, so on the chief
scientific officer, CSO, because I work
[SPEAKER_04]: with the plants, it's very, very easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just make sure that the plants look
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything, like you said, Gen Zero,
so we go everything through Maristem,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we sell those as clones to
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten incredible feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's been really, really kind and
really receptive to the project.
[SPEAKER_04]: My heart goes out to all the C suites
outside of me who deal with people,
[SPEAKER_04]: find customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always the toughest part of
business, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always very thankful to just look at
plants, enjoy being in rooms with plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: even now I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope to continue with this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: For as long as it manifests in this
amazing way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more like a rambler, according to my
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a theme on our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone we get is a rambler.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'll say is you speak a little bit
slower, and you allow us to ... There's
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks for us to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laugh that we had Michael Wolf Siegel
and Kevin on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys, they have so much inside
that they want to say that literally
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to be like ... You just listen
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to have ... Wolf is going to
have his own show on our network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kevin's going to be invited any time
he's got time to do it and has something
[SPEAKER_01]: to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same goes for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I hope you'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can finish this story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely think it would be cool if
you did an episode of The Way We Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say for entry level
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be for cultivators that have been
growing for a long time, but really don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the knowledge of what tissue culture
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always tell our guests that this
isn't an infomercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do a lot of plugging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really believe in what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I highly encourage people to check
you out on ... It's called the Kanatronic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you spell that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your Instagram and your business name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kanomic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Kanomic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kanomic.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go to his website and see what
the services, the classes that they offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, check out the Grateful Head
for their genetic repository that is
[SPEAKER_01]: growing every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're starting to get the clones out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thank you for joining us,
Phil and Sasha.
[SPEAKER_01]: A warm hug from California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
See you next time.
