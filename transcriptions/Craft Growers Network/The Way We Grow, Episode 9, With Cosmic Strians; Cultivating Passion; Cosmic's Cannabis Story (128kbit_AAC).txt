[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Nick Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, our guest is Cosmic of Cosmic
Strains, one of our fellow hosts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different podcasts that we do here on the
Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is also a breeder, a home grower,
and he has also recently ventured into the
[SPEAKER_01]: realm of cannabis, Maristem tissue culture
for his breeding efforts and other
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cosmic, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, long time no see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For all those listeners out there,
we just recorded another episode together
[SPEAKER_01]: this morning that you'll probably have
heard by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we seem to have a little bit
of a theme in the Craft Growers Network
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast of promoting tissue culture,
which I'm not opposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a huge thing that is going to
be necessary in the cannabis industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it viable for the next 10 to 20
years, at least, if not longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Cosmic, what's new with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, actually, I've taken a break
from acquiring any new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite the number of strains now,
but I have been waiting on an order and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's supposed to arrive here within the
next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should be getting Chem 91,
Stardog Guava, Pink Runts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dante's Inferno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the San Fran cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to check my notes and
everything, but super excited to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those old school strains going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your current library count at?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, honestly, I'd have to go and
take inventory because a lot of my library
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is only existing in my tissue
culture library.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have a lot of my strains still
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, the tendency to take on
a lot more than I probably should at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been juggling all these new
strains that I've been able to acquire
[SPEAKER_00]: with the library of seeds that I grew out,
as well as learning tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk a little bit more about kind
of what got me into tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm at with that a little bit later
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought we'd kind of kick this off
with a little story about my first time
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, you know, I like to find out if
you did if if your first experiences with
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in general were with cannabis or
if you perhaps maybe grew some vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: or flowers or other plants with your
parents or relatives or maybe somebody at
[SPEAKER_01]: a younger age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, so I would help my dad out
in the garden, you know, probably running
[SPEAKER_00]: off, not helping out as much as I should
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he probably spent a lot more
time looking for me to give me the help,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do remember picking up some things
from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, my first venture into growing
anything by myself was with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was 16 at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My high school girlfriend's stepdad gave
me the set of speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already had a pretty decent home
stereo system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these speakers were giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking probably three and a half
foot, four foot tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my teenage brain was like,
well, I have this bag seed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I found in one of the the gram
bags, you know, that I bought,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, let's try to do something with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind, my parents were
extremely strict, definitely not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going to let me smoke,
let alone grow anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, you know, just being a teenager,
just putting caution in the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gutted one of those speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a towel and I put it against the
mesh screen on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kind of taped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I installed a little computer fan and I
twisted it up to an outlet, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a plug that can plug in and get it to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a desktop lamp that I
somehow fastened to the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's pointing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had, you know, because I read that
fluorescent bulbs are OK for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know anything about T5s or
anything like that at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever fluorescent bulb I could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, once you know it,
I got probably up to I want to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: five sets of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was doing pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my mom found it.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suffice to say, I wasn't able to sex
it, let alone get any results from it
[SPEAKER_00]: besides, you know, getting grounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but how old were you when you did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably like 16 in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started smoking around 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I could have been as early as
17, but in that range right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's super funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting a giant speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes me what was it like one
of those tower speakers that had like
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four different speaker ports out
the front for the tweeters and the bass
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so you just pop off the screen
and then you can get into my little grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I even like took tin foil and
lined the whole insides of it with tin
[SPEAKER_00]: foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was super just, you know,
super jerry rigged.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I just I threw it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it would have been interesting
to see what would have happened if I
[SPEAKER_00]: managed to get it to flower, if it was a
female and, you know, if I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully get anything out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we'll never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still it's still fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it it shows the incentive at a
young age to want to see what this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had you already been smoking at this point
or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been a seed that I found in
bag seed, you know, and this was still
[SPEAKER_00]: when you could find like swag,
you know, like brick weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could have been just like a swag
seed, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and now all my growing is done intense,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny that I initially sought out
some form of growing where I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, it wasn't really about controlling
the environment, but it was more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: security of having a hidden grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny that I've evolved in a
tense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's it's almost like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's kind of the same thing,
but just a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, sometimes I'll save this
for the end, but since we're here,
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't you tell me about some like your
your first most memorable time smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: that would have come before you started
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was 16 the first time I smoked and I
made friends with this older kid at school
[SPEAKER_00]: who was kind of a burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know the type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was probably like a grade ahead of me
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided that we were going to
smoke, you know, smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's going to get me high for
the first time and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and for me, I felt like I had a little
bit of redeeming to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: My best friend in middle school was next
door neighbors with Mark Holman of Suicide
[SPEAKER_00]: Silence, a death metal band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember being in eighth grade and
we snuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend, you know, they smoked
together a bunch, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was, you know, knowing me and my
my shelter life, trying to help me
[SPEAKER_00]: experience smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got so close to smoking with him for
the very first time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I chink it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, my mom's going to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know how she's going to
know, but she's going to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's going to know on unrealistic,
you know, like paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so fast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 16, hanging out with this older kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he spent the night in my house
because I live very close to a golf
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up sneaking out at night and
going to this golf course and making a
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe out of, you know, a tin can or
aluminum can and poking the holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't I'm not even sure if it was
just the excitement or if I actually did
[SPEAKER_00]: get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do remember at one point trying to
put the smoke out of the can and I had it
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why isn't it lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so I don't know if I was just being
a goofy young kid or actually did get
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that was my first first
time, you know, smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that guy's name was Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely hung out with Mike a lot more
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we definitely got high afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first time I can't tell you if it
was the excitement or if it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: worked, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like sometimes it's just like
you don't even know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might be be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be, you know, just a kid just
thinking that you're high and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: around with your friends and goofing off
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like its own form of getting
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just giddiness, that goofiness
that you get when you're just laughing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the stupidest shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I feel like that is almost
like the same thing as just getting like
[SPEAKER_01]: super fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got that same sort of euphoric
feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you did this first grow and you
got grounded for it, when did you then
[SPEAKER_01]: take your next step back into cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same house that I was in when I got caught
across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: My best friend lived, you know,
and, you know, we we met each other
[SPEAKER_00]: because we lived across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I was in fifth grade and I
think he was in seventh or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, about two years older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, fast forward, I'm about 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I think, is when we took the next
step and he's another influence on people
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, I used to hang out with
that got into smoking before I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember him and our other friends,
you know, sneaking off and getting high
[SPEAKER_00]: and me being like a young kid,
like, oh, my God, I can't believe you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing that and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, you know, his his parents
were a lot more lenient than mine were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were a little bit more,
I wouldn't say like a full on hippie,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were a little bit more hippie
ish, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his mom was open to the idea of
starting a cannabis, a cannabis club,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a medical club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably I want to say like
2011, 2012, somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go ahead and they get all the
paperwork done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did all the legal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know, this is stuff that I
heard about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there for any of the proceedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as I know, they had all their
ducks in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't have like a commercial
location to do anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just kind of starting from the
ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my buddy, we'll call Mr. Chifa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Chifa and I went ahead and we
started growing and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like with the full blessing of his
parents, because his parents basically
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to have a grower at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just to paint the picture,
his house was kind of like the party
[SPEAKER_00]: house, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: His family house, his parents moved out,
you know, his siblings moved out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just him and his his girlfriend,
which, you know, it's his wife now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had roommates, a bunch of
roommates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we ended up doing is between
him and I, we rented out one of the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd pay half, you know, I think it was
like 250 every month and he'd pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: other 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were a tenant in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, he had some other
friends who did construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put up, you know, a wall to go
ahead and divide the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a flower room and then we had
the main room, which had the closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, part of it where we took the
doors off and that was like our little veg
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, again, we're doing
everything legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I at the point had my medical
marijuana license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of which, I currently have my
medical marijuana license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all you listeners, if you hear me
talk about having, you know, numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, I can legally hear in California
have up to 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really nice, too, because there's
not really any space restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in your in your your house,
you can have up to 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some commercial licenses, it's more
about square footage of grow space versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could potentially have, depending on
how big my house was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot bigger grow space with just the
medical license.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, yeah, getting back to the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing at the house and we got
some clones from some local cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had and who knows the
legitimacy of any of these genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly we had strawberry cough,
platinum kush, SFEOG, which that was my
[SPEAKER_00]: first experience with San Fernando Valley
OG kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been cemented in my heart as one
of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a good strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those golf ball nugs make it so easy
to trim, you know, especially from a
[SPEAKER_00]: growers perspective, something that's you
don't have to handle too much after,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the labor of growing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's that's preferable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody wants to be there
trimming for hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in California, I would either
go for SFEOG or Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the two that you could find
pretty readily in the market in like 2009,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just always so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we I actually just recently grew out
Tahoe OG and it's so similar to SFEOG,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very earthy turps to it just.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, honestly, for an OG,
it's not too heavy of a smoke for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like immediately knock me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's still more of, you know,
you can smoke it in function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to distract you from the story,
but back to this first rented room grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like White Widow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a couple other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably come back to me as a no
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're talking like 15 years ago here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I'm older now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like 17, almost 18 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, time flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, we were rolling and just
to kind of add a little to the story,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of his roommates and this is the time
where mobile dispensaries was in its
[SPEAKER_00]: infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still really new or like,
oh, shit, do you like what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call this number up or text this
person and they'll send out someone with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of weed and you can have it at your
house like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go to some sketchy
building and, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go through a security guard and stuff to
get into the old school medical clubs and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his roommate was doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess at this time, too,
he also kind of got into, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like cocaine and stuff, you know,
and for me, I'm really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I never got into any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always really I had like a strict
policy with myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as long as it can be grown in the
ground, like that's the only thing I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: mess with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like cannabis and a little
bit of fungus here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was really it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but unfortunately, his roommate,
you know, got into, you know, coke and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess he started selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't really know that was
going on at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a very important piece of the
puzzle here with what happens next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Chief gets a call from his roommate
and his roommate says, hey, one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: clients that I normally, you know,
mobile dispensary I normally deliver to
[SPEAKER_00]: once an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have the time to meet up with
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go ahead and on behalf of me,
give her an eighth and then I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: reimburse you when I get home,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as that sounds like a setup
as far as he knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the roommate wasn't doing
anything nefarious, like anything
[SPEAKER_00]: malicious or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just as far as he knew that was just
someone he's always like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered to and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it was like the girlfriend of
the guy that he normally delivers to and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that that goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a week or two later,
Mr. Chief, his house gets raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that this this woman,
she was actually pregnant, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little tidbit there, had gotten busted,
picking up some cocaine on behalf of her
[SPEAKER_00]: boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as a lot of people would
probably tend to do said, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you whatever information you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably got it from Mr. Chief as
roommate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lo and behold, you know,
that was kind of a sting operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a couple of weeks after
that happened, his house got raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of a funny side note,
I am so lucky at the time I was delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: for Domino's Pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I was playing because we
had the PC hooked up to his computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, hooked up to his TV in the
living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was playing Diablo 2 in the living
room, you know, smoking and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hanging out and not really too
many bills to worry about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: still living at home across the street,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I even considered calling out,
you know, just so I can continue to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, play some Diablo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was like, ah,
you know, it's just a small shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm leaving, we lived in a
cul-de-sac, by the way, as I'm leaving the
[SPEAKER_00]: cul-de-sac to turn left out and get out of
our neighborhood, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of take a peek to the right,
you know, looking for traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a whole shit ton of cops
gathered at the bottom of the cul-de-sac
[SPEAKER_00]: to the right of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get all, you know, like paranoid,
like, oh, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, that's so not normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called Mr. Chief and I'm like,
Hey, do you like, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a shit ton of cops down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, it feels off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you go like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you can do, but can you
go check it out or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, give me a call back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going on with my shift,
delivering pizzas and 10 minutes go by 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call him and I call a couple of times
and he's not answering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, that's so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have such a bad feeling about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of his other roommates,
not one that's involved with anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: just one that's living at the house,
calls and says, Hey, do you know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of DEA agents in Mr.
Chief's front lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my parents, you know,
they called me and like, Hey, what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on over at the house?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause again, they're across the
street.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his house got raided and they were
there solely for his roommate who was
[SPEAKER_00]: selling cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they tore his room apart,
the only thing they were able to find was
[SPEAKER_00]: a scale with a little bit of residual
cocaine on it or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably tell I'm not really
into that world by the fact that I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: saying cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like such a square, but anyway,
so when the cops realized that this big
[SPEAKER_00]: bus that they put together was going to
come with anything, that's when they
[SPEAKER_00]: turned their focus on Mr. Chief and the
room upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happened a couple of days after we
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were ready to start trimming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember on a table, we had a bunch of
nugs on branches that were ready to be
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a couple of jars and upstairs,
you know, I thought I was, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in my younger twenties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a dumb motherfucker, but I thought
it was so funny on the envelope that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were, you know, putting our money in for
like the rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put drug money on the front,
you know, cause that's a young 20 year
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just, Oh, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, so of course the cost on
that, you know, fucking envelope that's
[SPEAKER_00]: literally labeled drug money during the
raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sorry, sorry, Mr. Chief.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would either be drug money we'd write
on envelopes or we'd write citizens test,
[SPEAKER_01]: like from the departed, but we'd cross out
the Z and put a C below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently read on Reddit, there was some
girl who got busted with a bag full of
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs that on the front of it said,
definitely not a bag of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I laughed cause I, you know,
I get the irony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, back to the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got raided, you know, when he couldn't
find anything, you know, in the roommate's
[SPEAKER_00]: room, they turned their attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he even told me to like, they,
they picked up the nugs and they saw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Oh, good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like before they turned their,
you know, so it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they raided everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They emptied out, you know, the room,
obviously they went through every
[SPEAKER_00]: roommate's room at that point,
um, took all the drawers out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: dumped out all the contents of the drawers
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the house was trashed, you know,
and, um, I actually went to dinner with
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I want to say like three, four months
ago, and it'd been so long since we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he was able to kind of
give me a recount of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I've invited on the show to,
uh, he's a professional these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if he's going to want to
jump on, but hear his story, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: we've kind of heard, you know,
my telling end of it, it would be really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool to hear his aspect because he,
um, is the only one that actually got in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, I'm real, again,
I'm super lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, what did, what did they,
what did they tag them for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so felonies, um, there, uh,
there were some mushrooms that they found
[SPEAKER_00]: too at the house that, you know,
from some of the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people there, um, it wasn't even his,
but they found that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tacked that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then they, he, here's a tip for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if something ever like this
happens, just don't ever talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you can't talk your way out
of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will, nothing you say will ever
help you except, let me talk to my lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is literally the only thing that you
can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else will just give them an
opportunity to incriminate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they cornered him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there was, I guess, like a deputy
behind him and, uh, the junior sheriff or
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, one of the, it wasn't the
top guy, but you know, he was the one who
[SPEAKER_00]: orchestrated this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I guess he felt like he had a lot
on the line, you know, and their initial
[SPEAKER_00]: raid came up as a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're switching gears to go after
this, you know, canvas club basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he kept asking him over and over,
you know, like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like your friends would come over,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends would come over and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they'd come over and like they'd
smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, yeah, they smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, you're giving them weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, I wouldn't give them anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so I gave the straight, your friends
would come over, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who'd come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends would come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but, and then when they come over and
they would smoke, it would be your weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went in circles like this time and
time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, um, they, they had them
slip up and he said that he like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sold weed to one of his friends
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point that's, that's when they
put the handcuffs on them and they took
[SPEAKER_00]: them straight to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know so again everybody can't talk
your way out of any of this no like
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just waiting for you to say one
wrong thing and then they're gonna swoop
[SPEAKER_01]: in Yeah, that's that's pretty fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like tripping them up enough to make
them Admit their own guilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's uh Yeah, I went if they if the
cops ever come shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and You know his girlfriend and one
of his other buddies were there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and they kept screaming at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut the fuck up like literally He just
kept talking, you know This house is torn
[SPEAKER_00]: apart, you know, like He's hoping that
he's still salvaged the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, honestly, no matter what you
can't you know, that's what your lawyers
[SPEAKER_01]: for For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean and and you were still pretty
young, you know, like 21 years old getting
[SPEAKER_01]: raided by federal narcotics officers is I
don't think it was federal Narcotics
[SPEAKER_01]: officers are still no joke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean it was stuff like that and I
don't even like I think my mom just said
[SPEAKER_00]: it was DEA, you know, but it really wasn't
like she just saw people in jackets and
[SPEAKER_01]: the police You just assumed there were
drugs involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah They weren't wrong they weren't
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty funny So, I mean did
how did that shape your your cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: journey Once that occurred Well shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean after that I took a huge break from
from growing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I never really was there was a
couple times where I lived as a roommate
[SPEAKER_00]: at someone's house, you know and One time,
you know for a couple months I lived with
[SPEAKER_00]: my my ex and then she you know,
she left and you know, I Wasn't in a
[SPEAKER_00]: position to ever have my own place where I
can grow and I can do all the stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so Really I didn't start growing
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a huge stoner and you know,
as you can probably tell from behind me
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I play music and For a long time
I was pursuing, you know being a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional musician I guess you could
argue I was you know, I was solely paying
[SPEAKER_00]: my bills from teaching music and from
playing in cover bands A lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: really awesome experiences doing that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a couple original bands If you
guys want to hear some of this stuff I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually not on the recordings But you can
hear the kind of stuff that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: playing check out the band devotion That's
DEV and an ocean like the body of water
[SPEAKER_00]: Dev Ocean So super awesome reggae band if
you like sublime or any of those kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so Cal alternative reggae's
Amazing band to check out and I still talk
[SPEAKER_00]: with the singer and I'm still trying to
try to get him to you know Like he lives
[SPEAKER_00]: in Tennessee now, so it's it's not as easy
to get together And jam, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get us to you know sense of
tracks back and forth So cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: but uh, yeah, let's pick it back up when I
started growing again So I now live with
[SPEAKER_00]: my fiance We're gonna get married at the
end of this year, you know super excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about it We live in a house that she owns
with her mom and we're extremely lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: We're you know, we're essentially
professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any kids and we both have
decent paying jobs, so we're able to You
[SPEAKER_00]: know basically rent the house from her mom
without any roommates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So This room right here is actually
supposed to be my studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supposed to be my band room I have
you know, right my drum set over here You
[SPEAKER_00]: can probably see my little microphone But
I actually I have a full-on recording
[SPEAKER_00]: studio in here and it's kind of got pushed
to the side to become my second grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: things have definitely kind of exploded so
I Started growing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I I never Stopped smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I probably I don't think I've
really stopped smoking since I was 16,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like Maybe a month or two of not
smoking but consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just it's always Just always been
something that I really appreciate and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoy so I don't drink anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any I don't party I don't stay
up late, you know, but I do I do love
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking So, you know the pandemic hit and
myself at the time Oh, you know by the way
[SPEAKER_00]: a little background I now actually have a
career So a lot of times if you ever see
[SPEAKER_00]: me jump off the podcast or I'm not able to
make it to an episode It's because I'm you
[SPEAKER_00]: know working at my actual job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very lucky, you know to have a remote
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know as long as you're in this kind
of work as long as you're At your meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're responding to your messages and
you're completing your work or your
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets You know software engineers It's
not that big of a deal if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: online all day every day, you know As long
as you're doing your eight hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take full advantage of that,
you know, and I love my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love working and doing you doing the
work that I do the team that I work with
[SPEAKER_00]: is just incredible and I'm extremely
fortunate to be in the position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at you know, so But I've only been a
software engineer for about three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and I like to bring this up to
because You know my story is not very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique there a lot of people out there are
working jobs that they hate You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to say from firsthand
experience from all the stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done, you know I was a musician for many
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I You know worked a ton of odd jobs,
you know The thing that stopped me from
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking almost seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually in a week It'll be my
seven-year anniversary of stopping
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got a DUI, you know on the way
home from Playing the show, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was playing in a cover band And that put
an end to my job at the time as an Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked a ton of different jobs,
you know, and I want to let you guys know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's absolutely possible to become a
software engineer or I mean, there's a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: of different Specializations that you can
look into as well, but you can absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: learn this on your own from the computer
utilizing YouTube and then I also use this
[SPEAKER_00]: website called Udemy U-D-E-M-Y They have
courses that you can buy from you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people just put their own courses
on there But there are a ton of courses
[SPEAKER_00]: that have legitimate legitimately great
information that you can get some hands-on
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with but my my long-winded
point here is It's absolutely possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a software engineer on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need school for that You don't
need any of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and for me, it's absolutely changed my
life So I feel like even the greater point
[SPEAKER_01]: there is that you don't have to feel
pigeonholed into a single career path you
[SPEAKER_01]: can easily pivot if you find the the
skills and the knowledge necessary to do
[SPEAKER_01]: so like I went from being a chef for ten
years to now I work full-time as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivator and managing a
cannabis cultivation facility and That was
[SPEAKER_01]: all due as well to the pandemic and not
having the ability to continue to down one
[SPEAKER_01]: path, but having another path kind of open
up that's still Used a lot of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: skill sets that I had developed through
through kitchens and hospitality
[SPEAKER_00]: instructor for that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For for cooking no cannabis No,
I I learned it all myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's the other thing like I
Yeah, it was it was all through reading
[SPEAKER_01]: and watching videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, you know, mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wolf here is a prime example of if you
want to be a grower pursue it You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't let anything stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need education Besides what you
can you know, you can reach for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a ton of people who've not
only put amazing resources online but are
[SPEAKER_00]: available through forums that you can talk
with and you know We probably haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: talked too much about How you and I know
each other, but it's also It's the reddit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we're both moderators on
Craft marijuana an awesome sub,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's got some Really amazing
moderators too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all chat together and you know,
like the community there is super cool You
[SPEAKER_00]: know like a lot of really positive people
and a lot of people who are Not just there
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn but to also share the knowledge
that they have as well, you know So it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the worst kept secret of the the cannabis
community on reddit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are slash craft marijuana
subreddit is definitely probably the most
[SPEAKER_01]: positive and and helpful place When it
comes to to sharing awesome cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and knowledge Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean just kind of circling
back, you know, whether it's learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know software engineering or how to
grow or you know cooking or Automotive,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know repair or whatever you want,
you know, like don't let anything hold you
[SPEAKER_00]: back, you know, yeah Take advantage of the
internet and the people on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: too because there's a lot of people Yeah,
you'll run into a lot of assholes and
[SPEAKER_00]: pricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of really nice
people who are More than happy to share
[SPEAKER_00]: their experience and and their knowledge
with you Especially if you present
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself in a humble manner that says,
you know You know, I want to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not you know, no attitude,
you know, just I'm here with with an open
[SPEAKER_00]: hand You know help me fill it with
knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you did get back in to growing,
you know once you moved in with your
[SPEAKER_01]: fiance and Set up set up your your grow
and and stuff like what what led you down
[SPEAKER_00]: the path that got you to where you are now
so I I don't like this subreddit at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but micro growery Is kind of what inspired
me to look back into growing because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know at that point it occurred to me Oh
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a house to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these extra rooms like the room
downstairs where you know my My actual
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right next to the kitchen and it was
empty for as long as we were there like my
[SPEAKER_00]: fiance's sister Used to use it as like a
yoga room or you know She had you know her
[SPEAKER_00]: yoga mat and maybe a couple weights and
stuff, but she didn't live there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That room wasn't being used at all So I
spoke with you know, my future
[SPEAKER_00]: mother-in-law, you know, and I got her
blessing of course and I was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, you know like I think would be really
cool if I can you know a couple plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Here's the California state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have you know, was it like six
plants or 12 plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so long since I've been a
medical patient now I don't even know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the regular law is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just don't mind 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's typically but yeah 99 I
found out about Herbie's seed bank,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's based in Spain off of
people on micro growery and Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this is like 2020, you know,
cuz it's during the pandemic So at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time a lot of people were growing From
Herbie's there was oh, no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from original sensible seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Bruce Banner knockoff where it
was Let's say strawberry diesel times It
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't just an og cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Colorado ghost og so they
had like a different og that they mixed it
[SPEAKER_00]: with to Create their version of Bruce
Banner and then they also had like dosy
[SPEAKER_00]: doh og Which they use that same og the
Colorado ghost og and mix it with dosy doh
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually had those two strains
starting out I also had their knockoff of
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla glue, but I didn't have any good
luck with that But the dosy doh og was a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal plant, you know real really
good producer the the terps were Almost a
[SPEAKER_00]: little fruity a little sweet to it,
but it still had that kind of og gas to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, too again Super amazing producer the
Bruce Banner was almost as good of a
[SPEAKER_00]: producer The the gland heads for the the
THC They were so big and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very different from a lot of other
strains that I've grown out and That one
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely the phenol that I picked for
the Bruce Banner knockoff It definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: leaned a lot more towards the og side of
things and you can tell that from like the
[SPEAKER_00]: golf ball nugs and you know the structure
of the plant so it was just Something I
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciated and at the time,
you know, my knowledge on strains was very
[SPEAKER_00]: limited It was like what I heard from
school, you know Oh, yeah back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: we had some blueberry and we had some
trainwreck and you know I know about ak-47
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know like all those you know
classic strains that you you read about in
[SPEAKER_00]: high times or Like me in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got access to the computer lab and I
remember looking up Some different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Holland seed companies probably
like Dutch passion And a couple other ones
[SPEAKER_00]: and just looking at those old-school,
you know bud pictures and just dreaming
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh, yeah I would totally get that
strain and and actually that's when I when
[SPEAKER_00]: I started researching I got laughed at On
reddit about this but back in high school
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was researching about oh,
what's the most psychedelic strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like which is it's kind of funny
now that we know a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how People's unique brain
chemistry really dictates how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna feel from certain strains And stuff
but I remember reading Cinderella 99 was
[SPEAKER_00]: the most psychedelic hallucinogenic strain
You know and I kept that little nugget in
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain for like 20 years and I'm writing
on you know on reddit and people were just
[SPEAKER_00]: like laughing at me and you know at the
time I didn't really know too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So So, yeah, I mean I kept growing and at
the time I was working as a receptionist
[SPEAKER_00]: at an optometry so Not really making a lot
of money, you know working really shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and just do what I can Eventually I
Let's see So yeah, I already mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a lot of bands at the time I
guess technically I'm still in the band
[SPEAKER_00]: We're co-workers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really do too much music.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time my bandmate He started
encouraging me to you know to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: program, you know, and Maybe it was just
the way that you know, I put together
[SPEAKER_00]: songs and I structured things and I
thought of how to add, you know Melodies
[SPEAKER_00]: to riffs or whatever like he just he saw
something in me that Where he felt like it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be something that would really click
for me and he was right, you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: Started you know, I did have like a
programming class in in high school But me
[SPEAKER_00]: and my friend me my stoner friend at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were more interested in goofing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we figured out how to program And we
put emulators on the school computer and
[SPEAKER_00]: we were playing, you know, like old Super
Nintendo games against each other You know
[SPEAKER_00]: little I did I know that that knowledge
probably would have been important for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick up instead of playing You know
emulators and stuff Because you know here
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a software engineer so I mean I had a
little bit of experience with that but but
[SPEAKER_00]: my bandmate was right, you know,
it was really really awesome and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: leaned into that and Especially with his
encouragement, you know, cuz there's times
[SPEAKER_00]: working customer service that I did not
want to do anything at all and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is To paint the picture when I got
into this is is a little bit after the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic actually Now that I'm putting the
time limb together in my mind November
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 is when I started programming and
that was a couple months before the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So And how long had you been growing up
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean I started programming before I
started growing Again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but I wasn't doing a professional It
was just learning what I could on the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer following along with projects and
then making my own stuff up Ever one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the projects that I followed along with it
was on a PDF So it wasn't a video,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I had a really focus,
you know the whole time But I made my
[SPEAKER_00]: version of Frogger So I don't know if you
guys remember that old-school arcade game
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's a busy street and it's
got cars going, you know across the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: left and right and you have a little frog
Guy at the bottom and your job is to get
[SPEAKER_00]: him across the street to the pond You know
that a lily pad on on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to you know using JavaScript
program that I Utilized canvas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we have any any other
programmers listening But I made a little
[SPEAKER_00]: you know fun little game and it helped me
understand variables a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: and Functions and how to utilize logic and
a lot of stuff like that and I just kept
[SPEAKER_00]: building off of that Well, anyway,
I would say probably about a year maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: year and a half after working on it and
Again, I'd like to reiterate, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was working customer service right
after the pandemic and a medical office
[SPEAKER_00]: where I had a every single day wrestle
with grown-ass adults who didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on a fucking mask and it was just like
wear a chin diaper so much attitude like I
[SPEAKER_00]: always tell the story to my first day of
coming back from Pandemic I was off for
[SPEAKER_00]: two months, which was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got You know the pandemic pay which was
about almost double what I made,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so for the first time I felt like
I actually had room to breathe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit for my bills and then I utilized some
of that money to Start getting my tents
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very first day I got back of the
pandemic and everyone's on high alert You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, we just spent two months locked down
in our house, you know, like right we're
[SPEAKER_00]: fully masking up We're putting on gloves,
you know, like I don't know if we did the
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves when we you know hand sanitizer
We're basically bathing in it You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like keeping our distance from everyone
like if people got too close I'd be like
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to back the fuck up, you know,
like give me some space, please It makes
[SPEAKER_01]: me think of the South Park episode where
Cartman just has a Six-foot sticker a
[SPEAKER_00]: three-foot stick and pushes people away
from him So anyway the very first day I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: back I'm not happy that I'm in this
office, you know dealing with people after
[SPEAKER_00]: being, you know a hermit essentially and I
thrived by the way, I love
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll never forget and again working on
a medical office I had this gentleman's
[SPEAKER_00]: file in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew he was 61 years old This fucking
61 year old man was in our waiting room
[SPEAKER_00]: clipping his nails indoors Just letting
them fly all over the waiting room and No
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like not a care in the world and I
remember I was on the phone Like trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: help out another patient and I was so
disgusted in like just taking back I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to put the phone down and start
yelling at him, but I was just like I do I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like in shock That's that sums up my
experience working customer service like
[SPEAKER_00]: bro We were just locked down and you're
leaving parts of your body behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck man?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean a lot of periods when I
was working there that I just I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have it in me to go in and after Getting
yelled at, you know by people who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put on a mask, you know and all
sorts of stuff dealing with all those,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just Childish adults,
you know coming home and then working on
[SPEAKER_00]: your computer, you know Sometimes you just
want to go home and relax So there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of periods where I just want to work on,
you know my programming So I'm so
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate that that my friend was able to
you know, continuously Encourage me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know How's the programming going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been doing too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well What let's just take a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you about this one thing and
then he would like tell about like the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Some sort of technology that would
get me all pumped up and inspired again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool eventually you know,
he'd been working at this company for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years at that point and he was
extremely happy and At that point he let
[SPEAKER_00]: me know that this other company he
interviewed with you know was looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a programmer there a 10-year
startup, which is really bad to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: startup for that long and He known from
other programmers that they had cash flow
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and there's been a couple times
where they had employees hold on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: paycheck and blah blah blah, but The one
thing about programming is Most companies
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care if you have the education for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only care if you have the ability to
program So one of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: things besides putting together a
portfolio where you can show off some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the projects you've worked on and I mean
some not all because nobody wants to click
[SPEAKER_00]: through a thousand different iterations of
these calculators you made or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is sure But one of the biggest things that
can help you get a career in programming
[SPEAKER_00]: is experience and so I knew that Yeah,
I'm probably not going to be paid what I
[SPEAKER_00]: should be paid as a junior developer
There's known cash flow problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like It is what it is,
you know, so I've been But it was it was
[SPEAKER_01]: an entry-level position something to get
your foot in the door I mean, it's it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be seen as an entry-level position,
but I was the full-time programmer So I
[SPEAKER_00]: was what's known as full stack which so
there's front end and back end front end
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to a website is what you're
seeing it's the version of that website
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being downloaded on your phone and
Then the back end is on a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: computer that your computer can reach out
and make requests to and get responses of
[SPEAKER_00]: data back and forth That's the back end
and they're usually you know Like two
[SPEAKER_00]: different technologies and a full stack
developer can work on both aspects the
[SPEAKER_00]: front end and the back end Okay,
yeah, I didn't know that that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard full stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that though That's what I'm
a full stack developers can do front end
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the UI the user interface Which
also encompasses UX which is user
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, you know So you develop things
that people can click on they can interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with they can utilize that interface to
Get data from their back end and just a
[SPEAKER_00]: side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're supposed to be talking about
we and stuff I love technology too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a lot of fun and we'll loop this
back to by the way with cosmic strains
[SPEAKER_01]: because for sure I use you built your own
website Let's let's reel it back in then a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit to the cannabis stuff Because I
think that that is a great story And I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like that journey alone does show
people that they can not only purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: pursue something that they're passionate
about that they've spent their entire life
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying cannabis as well as Pursue
something that allows them to enjoy those
[SPEAKER_01]: things in life without the limitations of
You know being burnt out at the end of a
[SPEAKER_01]: day of a customer service job that pays
shitty and that you're just emotionally
[SPEAKER_01]: and mentally You know Done by the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to go home and start
working On some passion project because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're spent So it's really cool to to
show that like following something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you do have this desire to do as It helps
when you have a job that can support that
[SPEAKER_01]: as well it's it's hard to find though and
We we just had a recent guest where It's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna come to me But he oh Russ Spartan
grown he was able to translate his
[SPEAKER_01]: experience from one job of Working
shipping and receiving as well as his
[SPEAKER_01]: passion with cannabis and now he works for
and helps with distribution for Grand
[SPEAKER_01]: Master LEDs so It's a it is really awesome
to see when people can kind of combine
[SPEAKER_01]: those two things together and help like
not only their Their personal what they
[SPEAKER_01]: want in life, but also, you know the
necessities of living in a capitalistic
[SPEAKER_01]: market So that's really cool to pay bills
to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely So, yeah, I mean I got a little
sidetracked there but my main point of
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about you know my My jump into
software developing was the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom at first that came with that,
you know So I was able to continue to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: more packs of seeds, you know at the point
and So I would say October yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like October of 2021 is when I got my job
as a software engineer for the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: and At that time I had been just scraping
by you know, barely making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had maybe two tenths,
you know, and maybe a Couple different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, you know nothing nothing to you
it was a big deal when I got a new pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you know, and then eventually I got
that job as a software engineer and I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember being able to really splurge on
because of the seed packs I have my eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: and I kept you know amassing this
collection of seeds and At a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point, you know, and I'd already gotten my
medical license at a certain point I
[SPEAKER_00]: started, you know dabbling with breeding,
you know, cuz at that point I found some
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenos that I felt were really
special So I really was highly focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving those genetics in one way or
another, you know and My understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding was very limited, you know at the
time it was more of what we learned about
[SPEAKER_00]: in middle school with Mendel and you know
dominant recessive genes and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I knew that the Majority of the
weed I mean I would say all the weed that
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing was very high potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it didn't dissipate It would
still display a lot of the Characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: that I you know found appealing in those
particular phenos that it would have some
[SPEAKER_00]: some form of that You know plant inside
those seeds that came from it So to me
[SPEAKER_01]: before we get into some of your breeding
practices, actually, I want to rewind it
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit Because I feel like
before you get into breeding you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that you can grow a plant right
and so When you were growing at the the
[SPEAKER_01]: house back in the day that had gotten
rated What style of growing were you using
[SPEAKER_01]: and what practices did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take from that into your new growing
venture once you got situated in this new
[SPEAKER_01]: housing space with your fiance and Decided
to start growing in tents Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so um, I Have been a little unfortunate
where I haven't had really any in
[SPEAKER_00]: real-life Grommies, you know, I it's kind
of changing You know the last couple years
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff but You know when mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief and I started growing back in the
day we knew very little, you know and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even remember where we learned about
it, but we learned about the Fox Farms
[SPEAKER_00]: trio and so At the time, you know,
I was just doing the best I could I We
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized distilled water we didn't know
about pH or anything like that and we
[SPEAKER_00]: followed the chart and You know,
we were not growing at You know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: near what we probably could have done if
we knew what we were doing, but we are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know determined to figure it out We had
some high-pressure sodium lights that we
[SPEAKER_00]: got from the local grow shop, you know,
so this was a little bit I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like LEDs were Were available at
the time, but they were still in its
[SPEAKER_00]: infancy where the technology wasn't really
Defying what it was very expensive and I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember Hearing at the time that they
were just they were not worth their salt
[SPEAKER_00]: when they can in comparison to the other
You know types are lights that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: get so we went with HPS And yeah,
it was just the Fox Farms trio,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know using happy frog soil and was it
grow big big bloom and tiger bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know those three and Here here I am
We're at almost five years of me starting
[SPEAKER_00]: back of growing again, you know cuz about
March is when it's gonna be the five-year
[SPEAKER_00]: mark and I'm still you know on the Fox
Farms trio and that being said That's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to grow not at all, you know,
it's more of just If it's not even if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: don't broke don't fix it It's more of if
it's working then it's fine You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you can look through my reddit
account or my Instagram you can see some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nugs that I've grown and I mean
they look great and I'll tell you from
[SPEAKER_00]: first hand, you know, they smoke great too
So, I mean nothing against the Fox Farms
[SPEAKER_00]: trio, but me personally and after you know
meeting Gabby and I've had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with Gabby about
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gearing up to slowly Transfer,
you know or you know move my room over to
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics, you know, so one of the
things that you know one of my current
[SPEAKER_00]: struggles right now is figuring out how to
do the frame for a Flow trade that will
[SPEAKER_00]: not take off too much of the height It's
you know, cuz when you're growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, you have limited amount of height so
I don't want to you know, a third of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent to be you know flow table so for sure
you use a Condensate pump so that you use
[SPEAKER_01]: a very small catch reservoir with a float
valve on the condensate pump and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: just pump it out of the tent into a Larger
reservoir for your catchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So I mean I have seen is is my table
frame and then the the flow trays
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else I have pumps I have I have
the The sump pump, you know with the the
[SPEAKER_00]: valve or you know it will automatically
kick on if the valve gets to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: level and you know Again my my room is
right next to our kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Once my fiance and I get married at the
end of the year We're gonna be looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy her mom out of this house So it'll be
her in my house and at that time I can you
[SPEAKER_00]: know consider of course with my fiance's
blessing, you know Never never do stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: without you know talking to the missus
happy spouse happy house Exactly But yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the potential of you know setting
up some sort of drainage system in that
[SPEAKER_00]: room that drains into the kitchen sink or
the plumbing below this kitchen sink Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be ideal where I can You know
kind of do a was a float away system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're essentially into waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah drain to waste exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like All the nutrients that you
feed on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all drain to a reservoir No,
nothing that you're feeding your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: touches the other Plants and it's it's a
one and done, you know, so I've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: read that it utilizes a lot less of your
your hydroponics mixture in the water than
[SPEAKER_00]: a normal kind of Recycling reservoir would
do so that's kind of interesting but you
[SPEAKER_01]: have like less less maintenance required
because with the recirculating reservoirs
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's like you either top feeding and
then capturing it or ebb and flow systems
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're saturating from the bottom up
of the media You do have to adjust and
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor the pH and usually top it off with
fresh water pretty regularly Whereas you
[SPEAKER_01]: can set a nice reservoir and as long as
you're using Clean source water and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're buffering that water accurately so
that it doesn't swing the pH too much over
[SPEAKER_01]: time You can usually let those sit
depending on the temperature, of course
[SPEAKER_01]: for anywhere from three to five days and
be able to continue to basically feed your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really go long periods of time
without having to Physically need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: there especially if you set up either
timers or Wi-Fi plugs or anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: will allow you to then control the
Irrigation equipment or otherwise Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, absolutely Yeah, that's that's great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I I love hydroponics personally,
but I also love living soil grows and What
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the first plants that I remember
growing where I was like I'm gonna try and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the biggest plants possible it was
like tomatoes and stuff and and then
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at one point as well,
but it was all either The the Fox farm
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean forest soil or the happy frog soil
with the the three-part Tiger bloom big
[SPEAKER_01]: big bloom and Big but or whatever those
three are that grow big or grow big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah those and those always worked great,
especially For tomatoes and stuff like you
[SPEAKER_01]: could grow huge tomatoes with that Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But again, like I said before,
you know, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relatively easy system to be able
to understand and to be able to pull off
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the best, you know,
so I'm looking to expand one thing I did
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about too because I did make
a post on this back when I was first
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and Again, I got laughed on micro
growery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although we say micro growery Micro
clownery for real, do you fuck those guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was concerned about like
sourcing water, you know cuz again Pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: on my knowledge from back when we we tried
to start at that medical, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary back in the day We were using
distilled water and at the time I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay Well, that's what we used,
you know, and so I started doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Very not only time-consuming to
try to gather a ton of gallons of waters
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know store It and stuff but you
know, it can kind of add up after a time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know So eventually I started looking a
little bit more into sourcing water and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out and you know, I learned about
Depending on your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to look up your water
districts water report and so I did that I
[SPEAKER_00]: did you know, the one that was very close
to my house and You'd be surprised that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the chemicals that have to go in to
sanitize our water and to disinfect And to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it something that we can consume
without getting sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, you know, a lot of people know
about chlorine You know which you can very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily not really burn off but you can
kind of bubble off with your air stone
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight and stuff like that,
but My concern was like all that other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that they're putting in,
you know, and it's probably fine I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: we're drinking it but you know if we're
trying to grow as cleanly as possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to You know feed our plants,
you know using water that That's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: harm them, you know, I wanted to know like
what can I really do to?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know source that water at home and
make it an easier chore for me so I ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up getting some carbon filters that you
can buy on Amazon or something or Ideally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to look at whatever website
they come from because you know fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon and fuck all those billionaires So
I got that carbon filter and I was using
[SPEAKER_00]: that to basically do like a pre filtration
to my water And then bubbling off the
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorine, you know It basically like a
Brita filter or something along those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cool So, I mean it has all the the
different, you know forms of sediment in
[SPEAKER_00]: inside that you know, like you can look on
YouTube and find videos of you know people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the wilderness who make their own,
you know, like Filters, you know just to
[SPEAKER_00]: show like how how much cleaner the water
looks after running through it So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it uses like carbon in it and
and all that stuff, but Yeah, so one other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about that method is Not only does
it stripple, you know the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the water district adds to it but
it also takes out some calcium and our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants need that so I Add the calcium back
in by you doing the cal mag plus zinc I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't think it is and that's from this
iron You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my Notes here is it like the
botanic hair cal mag tie the care.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is It's a calcium nitrate
magnesium And iron Is it iron?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not zinc I always say zinc but I'm
wrong is iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I add that back in so basically I
have four things that I add You know to my
[SPEAKER_00]: water and I just follow the Fox Farms,
you know soil guide By the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I've learned a lot as I've done
this, you know, I'm I've learned a lot by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing As well, so just about any mistake
that you can make I probably made it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know So the main thing about making
mistakes is learning from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say this be very careful about the
the feeding schedule that you grab Because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one point when I was like,
okay So just because we've talked a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about my history, you know when I first
started growing I was scraping by so a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of times I would do a half eating,
you know And I I would almost never feed
[SPEAKER_00]: fully, you know, cuz I was trying to make
you know make my nutrition Last as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible before I had to buy, you know,
another another batch And so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: period where after years of doing that I
was like, oh shit, like I'm a software
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer now I can you know afford to to
feed my plants the way that they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be fed and You know, so I was probably
stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked up the feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't fucking realize that it was for
hydroponics and So for a whole feeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a whole run I was over feeding my
plants like crazy It ended up like my veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were kind of around the same of
what it should have been So they look fine
[SPEAKER_00]: But my my flowers were just like awful
dude, like so many dead leaves and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like what the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't figure it out and I finally
that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot they have the two different
charts for the soil and yeah That's so
[SPEAKER_01]: funny cuz yeah when I first started
growing I I wanted to do hydroponics
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was like this seems cuz
Initially like I I had grown, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: plants here and there throughout the years
But I didn't really go hard into it until
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed to pivot my my career So I knew
that hydroponics would be probably the the
[SPEAKER_01]: most widely used Source of nutrients when
growing in a commercial scale based on all
[SPEAKER_01]: the research that I had been doing at that
point just by looking online at forums and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and I saw that three-part nutrients
were really popular where you have your
[SPEAKER_01]: your bloom your veg and then your micro
Nutrients or whatever and usually like the
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients has your nitrogen and stuff
in it, too so I use like the cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: nation three parts from Fox farm still
because I had already had so much success
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Fox farm original trio When
growing all the other vegetables and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had grown throughout the years and
so yeah, I when I looked At that I it it
[SPEAKER_01]: was only built for hydroponics and then I
remember looking back at the other trio
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeing that they had the hydroponic
feeding and the soil based feeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: They were vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I learned the hard way We all
burn plants We all burn plants But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured it out and you know,
there was another time where I had issues
[SPEAKER_00]: with my pH, you know It took me a while to
figure out That you know at first When I
[SPEAKER_00]: first started, you know moving away from
distilled water I was peaching my water
[SPEAKER_00]: and then adding nutrients in and not
realizing like How acidic it would go the
[SPEAKER_00]: order matters You know because the
nutrients that you add in will absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: affect your pH another thing I had to
learn the hard way is Your pH will drift
[SPEAKER_00]: after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to mix your nutrients at least
they say like 20 minutes, you know 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes and that's probably for like when
you add pH for it to fully affect it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but honestly I would wait like an hour or
two, you know, and I've let it bubble and
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean even after that 20 minutes
if you take another, you know 40 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: or so and measure your pH again You're
gonna notice that it's it's still going
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know, so There's gonna be a
certain point where Your pH is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be changing as quickly and
so, you know that that's just another
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I kind of figured out over time You
know So let's kind of circle back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth story so we were talking about me
just getting into breeding and For me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a form of just saving the genetics
that I used all my hard-earned
[SPEAKER_00]: receptionist dollars on you know,
and the The plants that I just I really
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on making sure that I kept alive
for all that time You know and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge on cloning of course from back
when we try to do the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: club You know, but I still just because I
felt like everything was really special I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt the need to try to preserve it in you
know, the form of seeds so the very first
[SPEAKER_00]: Time that I went into breeding I Grew out
a regular pack of it's it from exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and that is gelato I'm not sure
what kind of gelato just said gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato times mint chocolate chip,
which is another one of exotics signature
[SPEAKER_00]: strains You know, so I thought that was
like a very decent one to kind of get into
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think I had gelato at that
time I just knew like the reputation of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and I knew that From everything I saw
on reddit that exotic genetics was a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty solid company So I figured it was a
pretty safe bet to choose that strain even
[SPEAKER_00]: though I didn't know too much about it and
let's let's jump into breeding so I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: that one out and you know, the dogs were I
would say they weren't like Anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinary where it was just out of
like just super unique It was it was more
[SPEAKER_00]: of just like standard like yeah,
it's super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces really well, you know,
it's Relatively like a medium plant so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's great for you know tent growing but
it's I don't want to say bland but it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems more of just kind of like yeah,
it's just like kind of like all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: weed around so with that being Said I felt
like it would make like a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle to you know Maybe put pass on some
of the more unique traits from the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and again I didn't I didn't know
too much about recess under dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like hey, let's just Let's
just jump in, you know Sometimes you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to throw it all at a wall and see what
sticks for real dude and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I do is is kind of like let's
just the only way you can start learning
[SPEAKER_00]: is by getting it and doing it,
you know, so that's what I did is I jumped
[SPEAKER_00]: in and I ended up growing out a bunch of
different other strains that are regulars
[SPEAKER_00]: and selecting males, you know,
I typically like to find the males that
[SPEAKER_00]: Show their sex pretty early and then when
you flower them out that they drop pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively early for me, that's a good
indication that you know the Genetics from
[SPEAKER_00]: that are gonna be a little more faster
finishing for flower times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny that you choose for Early
early flowering males as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's how I choose for males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I But like I'll hear from so many other
breeders that have been doing it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time that they always say like You
don't want to choose the male that shows
[SPEAKER_01]: last but you definitely don't want to
choose the first five that show and They
[SPEAKER_01]: say that that's due to potential
instability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I'm just like it if you can
keep it in a vegetative cycle where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not showing a lot of its sexual parts I'm
not I'm not too worried about it But
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fascinating that you also choose
the early flowers because that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: always wanted faster flowers like I wanted
it to show its flower early and Because
[SPEAKER_01]: usually that means that you'll find
something within there if it's a 65 day
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't start showing till day 21
Well, if you can get it start showing at
[SPEAKER_01]: day 10 or 14 then maybe you now have a 59
day strain and I was always aiming for my
[SPEAKER_01]: when my efforts whenever I've done like a
small breeding project was how can I make
[SPEAKER_01]: something out of this commercially viable
so that it can be Or even a for home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, you know, no one wants to grow a
strain that takes way too long It it's
[SPEAKER_01]: that much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that much more risk for error
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean The way that my room
downstairs is set up is three tents
[SPEAKER_00]: technically four because I have a little
two by two by three foot Like this my
[SPEAKER_00]: little clone tent, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having a little clone tent,
you know tent just for my little my little
[SPEAKER_00]: domes Yeah, but ideally I have a four by
four tent I have a three by three tent and
[SPEAKER_00]: a two by four tent and the two by four
tent would act as my veg tent and Then the
[SPEAKER_00]: other tents would be offset by a month,
but they're my flower tents So ideally if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a strain that finishes in eight
weeks, then with that setup, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting once a month, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's what I was shooting
for and I do want to point out too that
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I you know, I've done things
in the past isn't necessarily the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue to do things You
know, this is it's been an evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: who I am as a grower and you know And the
things that I've learned and the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm doing So yeah, I mean I I did
that first run with it's it I grew out
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those those strains and you know,
I had some really Really nice plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out of that overdose II was one of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see that on my site I I don't
have overdose II It's self available,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have a lot of mixtures with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like overdose co g and I forget all the
I mean I came up with so many fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: names, you know All the shit that I wrote
that's the fun part it is, you know You
[SPEAKER_00]: could tell some of them I got a little
lazy for but some of the names that I came
[SPEAKER_00]: up with I'm extremely proud of like
ectoplasm That's one of the strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably gonna end up taking past f1
So yeah that being said all the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: available on my site are f1s, you know I
do want to move on to making stable lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything like that But I'm still in
the beginning of of what I hopes to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish, you know, and everything just
takes time so we'll talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in a second, but Yeah Kind of
kind of going back I did the it's it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I had a couple other Seed runs that I
did where I was practicing other
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination techniques So there's one
technique that you can if you collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen ahead of time You can actually
utilize and I know we've talked about this
[SPEAKER_00]: before but a paintbrush And you can paint
on the little buds very carefully because
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen likes to fly You got to make
sure you don't move a lot, you know create
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of airflow and stuff But very very
gently do I have a pen here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gently I can take my little paintbrush
here and just just barely paint it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, you know, and you'll know if you're
if your buds accepted the pollen because
[SPEAKER_00]: after a day or so your pistil is gonna
shrink and it's gonna turn almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown instead of like the orange that
typically shows but I would go ahead and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would paint a couple buds on a single
branch and then I would grab a paper lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: bag and I would put it over the bud and
I'll tape it and leave it like that for
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five days and at that point,
you know, the pollen is not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: viable anymore It's not supposed to cross
pollinate in the other branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can utilize that technique very
carefully and On one plant have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different crosses, you know on each
different branch So I tried that technique
[SPEAKER_00]: too, and I did another, you know seed run
like that where I made a ton of different
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses It's always having a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was feeling pretty good about
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would go down the Hydra store and
I would you know, just kind of shoot the
[SPEAKER_00]: show with the guys there and Eventually,
I kind of gave them some of the seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: I made and like hey, you know Like this is
I'm just doing for fun and they got super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited and at that point they were
encouraging me to open up like a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company, you know, and so Very naively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay, let's do it By let's I mean
So, you know, I noticed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them had seeds available for sale
and I was like, you know, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like a big hole in the market,
you know, cuz this Like for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I had to order at the time,
you know I were from Europe and I you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have to wait like a month to get your
seeds and Typically you want them hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So There was times where I got you know an
order of seeds and it was like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: children's like cloth book, you know that
they're they have all these tactile
[SPEAKER_00]: sensations on it and stuff and I had to
rip it open and there's another time it
[SPEAKER_00]: arrived as a baby doll and I had to pull
the leg off and Reach in the body and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, I was like, you know,
that's Kind of cool, but that sucks like
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to wait so long I can't just go
to the store and talk to someone real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and pick up a pack of seeds so you
know, I felt like you know, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably an opportunity so I Reached out
to mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiefa and again, this is like 10 15 years
Yeah closer to 15 years after our whole
[SPEAKER_00]: raid incident and he's a professional at
this point He doesn't even smoke or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that anymore You know,
but his profession is an accountant You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I feel like it's okay to say that
so, you know He's got a lot of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to businesses and the books
and how they run and everything like that
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a software engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put together this rudimentary website
that can you know serve as a store for the
[SPEAKER_00]: company I've done, you know, I've put
thousands tens of thousands of dollars of
[SPEAKER_00]: my own money into this operation You know,
I have all this product, you know coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up You know or planned, you know Because
at the time I didn't I didn't do my first
[SPEAKER_00]: run my first commercial run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and so the plan was to have him come
to the administration stuff and not take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of the growing and the website and We
really tried for months and months and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually It was very apparent that he
was just too busy, you know, and so I just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up, you know Sometimes you got to
do this too in this day and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to just be like, hey You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to let me know like No more
pussy-footing around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Tell me if the answer is no,
you're not gonna hurt my feelings But
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to just let me know so I
can put make my next move So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer was, you know, he's not able to
do it and I've already built a bolus
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum in my mind You know plus all the
thousands of dollars I bought on seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: plus if I'm gonna be perfectly honest,
you know One of the appealing things about
[SPEAKER_00]: having to see company is oh now I can
justify all my purchases of seeds that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to buy Right because you're trying to
make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's for the business, you know These
these packs of seeds so yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I pushed on a Ford and Started
researching and figuring out what it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: to create an LLC and I found a cannabis
lawyer nearby that specialized in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business law so I had a consultation with
him to make sure I wasn't breaking any
[SPEAKER_00]: laws because you know as Now that I'm a
software engineer, you know for me my
[SPEAKER_00]: career is is the most important thing and
I love Growing and I let you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love everything like that's come from
from doing this But ultimately my main
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility is my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah as a professional kind of wanted
to kind of stay more in the shadows too So
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to get you know, other people
involved and it just it wasn't working out
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I got the LLC I met with the the
cannabis business lawyer again to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure I wasn't breaking any laws make sure
I wasn't getting in trouble with my job or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that and We're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I opened up my LLC in the summer and
I'm still working on the website because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not up to the point where I can take
orders, you know, like I'm At that point I
[SPEAKER_00]: was using it as an opportunity to learn
react and I'm not sure a lot of if any
[SPEAKER_00]: Software engineers are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll know react is You know basically
the framework that Facebook made and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I'm not a big fan of Meadow or any
of that stuff, but I really do Like react
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way that you know, it almost
works like Legos So anyone who who like
[SPEAKER_00]: putting Legos together as a kid,
you know, that's It's the program
[SPEAKER_00]: programmatic version of Legos if you will
or it came just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway So yeah, I mean I opened up the
company and I did my first You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I finished up my first run which I
utilized from archive seed bank Casper og
[SPEAKER_00]: and that had ghost og and face off og and
I think it was like that cross three or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that I'll have to look at
my notes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know in my mind I wanted to start
with a solid og strain and og's they just
[SPEAKER_00]: are notorious for being very hardy plants,
you know, like You know this whole process
[SPEAKER_00]: I would even Say that I'm not like,
you know, I definitely have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge when it comes to this stuff but
during the whole process I wasn't like the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest grower ever, you know,
like You know, there's a lot of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that are known for being finicky
And at that time if it was if I had one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those finicky strains who knows if I would
have you know got up to the finish line so
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that doesn't sound great but Really
the way that I look at it is all the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I worked with at in the very
first beginning of You know when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and before like I decided to do
this company They were willing to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I put them through the ringer
and I feel like that is a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to have, you know, to have very
hardy plants where you know, I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: joke back a couple years back that if I
could grow these out then anyone could
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them out, you know, because They're
not finicky at all, you know, like I was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get them to the finish line
despite how many problems I battled and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything like that So that was another
thing that I really look for in my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: is just how hardy are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much abuse can they take?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know because Do you apply any sort of
abiotic stressors to your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're Like physically trying to
create extra stresses in order to like
[SPEAKER_00]: proof out genetics or anything like that
So that is the plan going forward So at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time I should probably do a little
bit of a summary because I know we're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of we're about an hour close to an hour
and a half here and I don't want to bore
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody but My game plan in the beginning
was to make several f1 lines and just do a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of that initial legwork You know
just I have all these plants that I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: from seeds all these different phenos some
of them are really interesting some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are probably close to what they
should be, you know what you expect to get
[SPEAKER_00]: from those seeds and I wanted to take that
opportunity to try to get as many
[SPEAKER_00]: different crossings as possible and It's
not that I saw that they were gonna be all
[SPEAKER_00]: viable like Very perfect crossings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some crossings that I knew were
gonna work out very strongly and those
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I absolutely put on my site,
but there's a lot of crosses that I made
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not available on the site at all,
you know, and it's because either I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get enough seeds where I felt like they
can be something I can put in packs and
[SPEAKER_00]: have you know X amount of packs to offer
to people or it's because I didn't think
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were gonna actually,
you know produce something that was gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be worthwhile to you know Have someone not
just pay the hard-earned money for but
[SPEAKER_00]: spend the time and resources to grow it
out, you know, so You know the first phase
[SPEAKER_00]: that I basically did is I just I want to
create as many different F1s that I can I
[SPEAKER_00]: can do and then after that I can switch on
switch over to starting to work with those
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s and bring them to F2s and beyond and
at that point, you know, my plan was to
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow my focus and You know kind of start
drilling down on these strains that I
[SPEAKER_00]: started However something interesting
happened last year Right as I finished my
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth line though the widower line,
which I used Was it a widow cake which is
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding cake times black widow That's from
people under the stairs I've had some
[SPEAKER_00]: really good experience with their stuff
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the people in the stairs
So right as I finished up my my last line
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the moderators the fellow
moderators on craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know about this website,
you know, I'm not even gonna say the name
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're a bunch of clowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, you know, we thought to
the best of our knowledge that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: legit and so I spent Almost two grand At
the very end, you know, I spent $1,200 for
[SPEAKER_00]: a full order, you know, because when I do
things I go all out, you know so I ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of plants and then These are
clones or seeds clones So I wrote a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of clones and that's the time when I
started learning about HLVD hop latent
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid disease also known as the dudding
disease and that's when I realized how big
[SPEAKER_00]: of a problem that viroid is and how
serious it is and Luckily, I had the
[SPEAKER_00]: foresight to go ahead and quarantine those
clones that I got but after some
[SPEAKER_00]: Encouragement from some people on reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went ahead and I paid the extra $400 or
so to get the tests and I tested those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and I think out of the 12 clones
that I had the first tests revealed four
[SPEAKER_00]: of them had hop latent viroid disease and
So I'm freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw those four away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like fuck man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $400 not to mention the cost of the
test in the trash and then you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course you can't do just one round of
testing because Even if a plant's healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: it could still be infected and that virus
the viroid Load is not great enough for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be detected in the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to give a little bit
extra time so we I waited another two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and I retested the eight remaining
strains and Another four tested positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point I was like That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not gonna pay for another round
of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw them all out and You know
that sucked, you know, that's $1,600 that
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw in my garbage Not to mention
all the time that I took up in my room and
[SPEAKER_01]: be stressing about it And we don't we
don't have to talk about where you source
[SPEAKER_01]: these from if you don't want to but can
you describe the experience that you had
[SPEAKER_01]: when you reached back out to the This
company to explain the situation that you
[SPEAKER_01]: you went through third-party testing to
make sure that it was clean stuff that was
[SPEAKER_01]: Claimed to be clean to you initially And
since they were quarantined, they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have other interactions potentially with
other contaminations other than What would
[SPEAKER_01]: have been occurred at the original source
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah explain a little bit more about
the interactions that you then had with
[SPEAKER_01]: these people I feel like that's very
important for the community here I reached
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the shop owner and I let him know,
you know and He was not very friendly at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, you know, I I sent screenshots of
proof and He was basically telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing he's gonna do for me and
then he found one of my reddit posts it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like is this you is this you and so he
was at that point ignored my questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: he was coming hostile with funding my
posts and so I felt like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy has all my information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna worry about this much longer
because it seems like he's getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to dox me, you know, and you know,
basically Hey, here's this guy's phone
[SPEAKER_00]: number his address like everything,
you know So at that point I just had to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk away and then I did my duty of
letting the community know like hey Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever fuck with this company ever,
you know, here's my experience and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like I think I held off on telling
people about him like threatening me just
[SPEAKER_00]: to give it a little time so he wouldn't
you know dox me but Yeah, that that
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely happened, you know,
and at that point too, I made my LinkedIn
[SPEAKER_00]: private because again, I was like,
you know if this guy's gonna go out as a
[SPEAKER_00]: vendetta, you know, I don't want him to
Like try to contact the company I work for
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like at that point I just
felt like it was better to let other
[SPEAKER_00]: people know and just walk away and take
the hit myself, but Did he accept
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility at all for the hops late
and thyroid or did he basically try to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that your testing was?
[SPEAKER_01]: False or or something along those I'll say
none of the above just not really
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledgement on his end Just like
nothing you can do like oh, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, you know like Wow so the one good
thing that came out of that because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were a lot of I mean Another thing I'll
say about these companies is you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know if what they're selling is the actual
strain that they're selling they can just
[SPEAKER_00]: pick any plant and they can send it to you
and Even if you grow it out unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: really know that strain very well or
someone who does You never really know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're getting, you know,
it could be bomb as hell It could be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty pretty close to the turps that it's
supposed to be but I mean I Realistically
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're doing genetic testing to
compare the the genes of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know You really can't tell what you're
getting, you know for sure we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about earlier that Tahoe OG if I didn't
know that it was Tahoe OG and I looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: those nugs and I smell the turps I would
think it was SFEOG for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No similar, you know You just have that
like slightly different rounding to the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the buds versus The peaks of the
SFEOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and another thing too, like I've
really been Diving into the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between chemo types phenotypes and
genotypes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really interesting articles too and
Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the way that we use the term
phenotype It's it's actually it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's incorrect compared to the definition
because a phenotype is not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics presenting in the plant,
but it's also The way the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts that plant So you can have like a
pheno is all the different ranges that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's able to produce depending on the
environment Yeah, the phenotype does yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: the phenotype for a single cultivar would
range and then the the genotype is what
[SPEAKER_01]: that individual cultivar is and then the
chemotype is the expression in a given
[SPEAKER_00]: environment exactly exactly, you know,
so I've been trying to learn a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: about you know about breeding and about
You know the terminology so I don't I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't sound like just someone who works
out of his hope here It's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one of those things though that it
like just with your Like programming and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can easily look into a lot of these
different things I feel like there are a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people that want to get into
breeding even if it's just to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Chuck some pollen in a tent or
something just to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Feel like people think that it needs to
be this ultra precise scientific approach
[SPEAKER_01]: Where as long as you can take notes and
you can use your anecdotal evidence to
[SPEAKER_01]: guide you There's a lot of people that
have created some phenomenal Phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and my knowledge might be a
little outdated too, but I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's and correct me if I'm wrong But I
don't know if there's a lot of literature
[SPEAKER_00]: out there on Proven dominant genes and
recessive genes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably some anecdotal stuff out
there, but I don't know if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like This is for sure a dominant
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for sure a recessive gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's some through like
companies like phyllos bioscience But due
[SPEAKER_01]: to some controversies that the cannabis
community faced when these different
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics mapping laboratories opened up
initially they lost a lot of faith with
[SPEAKER_01]: the community because of Certain practices
that were claimed to be and then what
[SPEAKER_01]: actual practices then occurred and how
Because the cannabis community was so
[SPEAKER_01]: tightly knit and held so many of these
cultivars very closely guarded within
[SPEAKER_01]: tight-knit communities When somebody then
says we're going to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting you the information for this
so that you can use that information in
[SPEAKER_01]: your breeding practices and Then takes
that information to use it within their
[SPEAKER_01]: own internal breeding practices as well as
genetic acquisition maneuvers It So there
[SPEAKER_01]: is information out there yes to answer
your question there are certain specific
[SPEAKER_01]: traits Whether it be like cannabinoid
profiles terpene profiles flower
[SPEAKER_01]: morphologies pigmentation Recessive and
dominant traits for height Flower
[SPEAKER_01]: structure flowering time all these
different things they have been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: map them to specific loci, but Getting
access to that information now is also
[SPEAKER_01]: gate kept behind Typically massive
paywalls hmm Yeah, I mean when I did a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of this initial research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's before it was even recreational
Recreationally legal in California so
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are how many years 12 I think 2012 if I
remember I think that's when What for 2012
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016 I think it would would have been 2016
or 17 that it went Recreate I think it it
[SPEAKER_01]: was voted on in 2016 and then it went into
effect 2017 because my my partner and I
[SPEAKER_01]: left California in 2016 and we both had
our 215 card still and then We came back
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could go to the dispensaries the
same dispensaries that we could only go in
[SPEAKER_01]: with a medical license before we could
just walk in with our ID and that was Kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of it was weird being away for a little
bit coming back and it being totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean we've have legal weed for
what almost almost eight years now and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I feel like with the legality coming
it it reduces a lot of the The clandestine
[SPEAKER_00]: this like like the fact that you have to
remain hidden with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more home growers growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more companies that Are you
know don't have to be so secretive about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like the research that's coming
out now It's a lot more easy to access it
[SPEAKER_00]: than it was before, you know and There
still is a lot of bro science that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: around but I think it's a lot less than
what we previously had to deal with so for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I mean look we're still both using
pseudonyms to to display ourselves to the
[SPEAKER_01]: community it to have some level of
Anonymity There's still a huge stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean federally it's not legal,
you know, so I always got to remind myself
[SPEAKER_00]: of that Anytime I travel it's just so
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you travel to a state where
it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like This is just bizarre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how do you people live like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's crazy to think that like you can
fly out at JFK in New York And they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: care if you're carrying cannabis you can
fly out of ssfo in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care If you're carrying
cannabis, but hey you touch down in
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So Although I'll say from experience,
you know Having a pen in your backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, I visit my allegedly allegedly
I visited So yeah kind of getting back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the the one good thing that came out of
that whole fucking clusterfuck of of
[SPEAKER_00]: buying those diseased clones Was that's
when I started learning about tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture because I was obsessed with not
throwing my money away You know and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of those strains We start talking about
this but a lot of strains of what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were supposed to be, you know And I was
just at the time assuming they were what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were You know, they were things that
I was I bought seed pack after seed pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know One of them was Bruce Banner
number three and you know, I bought that
[SPEAKER_00]: knockoff one, but I also Bought a ton of
stuff that had Bruce Banner mixed in just
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had it mixed in You know the
same thing with a lot of those breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, you know, I bought So many packs of
seeds because it was mixed with GMO and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted you know GMO but I didn't know
anybody and There was one clone company
[SPEAKER_00]: party that I found Right after the
pandemic and I have not been able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: any information on them ever since it was
called og life and Santa San Bernardino,
[SPEAKER_00]: California It was a breeder collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I found it online, you know,
just searching clones near me and I only
[SPEAKER_00]: have actually I only have one clone left
from them Which sucks because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: all really good at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got SFEO G sour diesel and sour diesel
is only one I have left Let's see here
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry milkshake, which is one I
haven't really heard of but the picture on
[SPEAKER_00]: their website sold me was super frosty and
I knew I was I wanted one that was gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be good for you know, making bubble hash
Jack Herrera Gorilla glue number four and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Girl Scout cookie Finment,
so I had all six of those from that
[SPEAKER_00]: company I mean Luckily out of the ones
that remained I did test them and none of
[SPEAKER_00]: them had HLVD those years later So I got
lucky with that, you know, cuz I was way
[SPEAKER_00]: before I knew about HLVD But yeah,
so Sorry, I'm kind of jumping around a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit but no, please just why don't
you kind of like talk about how you
[SPEAKER_01]: started your journey into tissue culture
what resources did you sort of seek out
[SPEAKER_01]: and then Where do you feel as though you
found the best information because it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like almost with everything else
that you do you you were self-taught in In
[SPEAKER_01]: the tissue culture space as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean If there's a will there's a
way, you know Just like programming just
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything, you know, like The main
thing that's gonna be required of you is
[SPEAKER_00]: your drive is your drive for that
knowledge You know and it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: how many resources you have if you don't
have that curiosity and that desire to To
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more and to build off of what you've
already learned, you know, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're not gonna get far so For
me, I had that obsession, you know about
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to save those those clones that I
got from that clone You know vendor and it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work out, but that's what started
me, you know learning about tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fact that tissue culture
especially Mary's stem tissue culture has
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to basically make a new clone
of that plant that is free of Viroids or
[SPEAKER_00]: any systemic diseases that the plant may
have, you know, whether it's viroids or
[SPEAKER_00]: funguses molds like whatever, you know,
so That really interests me and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: already dabbled a little bit in gourmet
mushrooms So I learned a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: my ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had bought a flow hood for that Gourmet
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah The kind that you eat,
you know, nothing nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Are there any other kind of mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: For subsidence and then there's the kind
that you eat to die, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably take my my golden,
you know thinking have to put on you know
[SPEAKER_00]: to start thinking about what other kind of
mushrooms your golden teacher hat my
[SPEAKER_00]: golden teacher hat So I had a flow hood
and I had a little experience with making
[SPEAKER_00]: agar plates and you know working on you
know, very sterile techniques and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you're You're not
putting your arm over stuff that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on or you know I even started
before I had a flow that I worked in What
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck are they called a still air it's
not technically a still air box,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's it's very similar to one And
actually I'll just say a side note from
[SPEAKER_00]: what I understand still are Still air
boxes are not ideal because you put your
[SPEAKER_00]: arms into those You know those little
sleeves and you can still push air Inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the box by moving your arms in there,
too so from what I understand doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: the method where you Cut the holes in like
a tub is supposed to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier because you can move a little bit
more gentle and create less airflow But I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to worry about that anymore
because I have the flow hood and flow
[SPEAKER_00]: hoods are awesome So, you know,
I had already some experience with working
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know kind of a home laboratories
setting and I had already, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: already had the equipment so I went ahead
and At this point, you know I've thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: away a bunch of plants and I was really
disappointed discouraged, you know it
[SPEAKER_00]: threw me off of what I had planned on
doing by a couple months and I I vowed
[SPEAKER_00]: never to buy clones ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care But you know a couple months
later one of the other mods on reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like hey check out this discord
this other breeder And I promised the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder that I won't say his name or
anything like that or you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever but They had a falling out with
one of their business partners To kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it, you know a little generic about
what's going on But he was at a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where he was ready to start selling off
the club the strains that he's collected
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years, you know, so Wow,
I Started off and he was selling it super
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap too, you know, and I Initially was
like no but you know It was coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else that I I knew and you know He
had a good authority that this person was
[SPEAKER_00]: legit and they were selling clean clones
And you know, so I said fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's order free and I think at that
point I got GMO stardog Cory cut and Zero
[SPEAKER_00]: graph which is kind of a newer strain that
that one's like Oreos times GMO Because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was gearing up to at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do a fifth seed run I haven't
done it by the way But I wanted to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: use this star 95 mil that I picked out and
it was half stardog half I-95 So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in my mind I was like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get some of these, you know I've
been chasing GMO for all these years
[SPEAKER_00]: buying all these seeds and this is
potentially the actual GMO plant so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just get that and then we can breed with
it and I tested those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all clean all good to go and I
Wait a couple weeks and I was like fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got that list all these other all
these other plants and so here I am I I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I bought like over 40 from all these
breeder cuts You know, I've tested the
[SPEAKER_00]: first 16 that I got from them All clean
all good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown out a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check them out on the Instagram on
on the reddit You know, they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing They're the terpenes are exactly,
you know for the most part One of them we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it got mixed up in transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, but it's still super bomb
So that one, you know, there was a you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, this is not what it's supposed to be
but everything else looks like it It's
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the money So basically once that
happened I decided that I had to shift
[SPEAKER_00]: gears, you know because sometimes you just
have to roll the punches and Instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a fifth line of f1s, you know that
Might be interesting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the star 95 was a little bit of a
longer flower and you know Like we
[SPEAKER_00]: previously discussed I want flower times
around the eight weeks is is my ideal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know eight weeks is a great flowering
time to shoot for So I decided to shift
[SPEAKER_00]: the change gears and to start getting you
know, these breeder cuts that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available Because it was presented to me
as it was gonna be a limited time thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so Sometimes you got to get get
it while the getting is good, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got strike while the iron is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I Started collecting a bunch of these,
you know plants and then at that point I
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to take the tissue culture
seriously I'd already done one round of
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagation Which doesn't require,
you know a microscope but I was you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to my research the only way to
You know Really cure these plants of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that they might have had,
you know, if there was any fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: infections or anything else Was through
Mary stem and so I went ahead and I bought
[SPEAKER_00]: a microscope And I got that set up and you
know, I started researching different
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture the media protocol So,
you know, the recipe is called protocol a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of the lingo But you know,
I started making my own and I did some
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary stems and I noticed after a couple
weeks I was getting growth and it was hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is actually it feels like it's
something I can I can actually do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I my very first Mary stem I took back at
the end of like August September.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was closer to October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a gelato 41 So I took this was
a Mary stem and now we have almost a
[SPEAKER_00]: full-on plant and it kind of sucks because
it doesn't really Yeah, I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna focus too well, but you can see here
at the very bottom we have a callus and
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to see on the camera But
I promise you who there's these little
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny white shoots of roots coming
out of the callus, too So this is starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to root and the significant About this is
I didn't use plant growth regulators at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is completely done with just agar
sucrose, which is this table sugar and M&S
[SPEAKER_00]: which again, I'm probably gonna Completely
pronounce it incorrectly, but Marishuga
[SPEAKER_00]: and Skoog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how you say it but
Essentially, it's three items for tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have something to hold things in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the agar Something to give the plant
energy which is the sugar because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: known Already utilizing photosynthesis and
then something to give the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Nutrients, you know, it's food
and that's the M&S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Marishuga and Skoog So anyway,
that's kind of where I'm at I've really
[SPEAKER_00]: put a lot of my breeding aspirations on
the back burner while I figure out You
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to completely pull off Mary stem
tissue culture at my house, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a laboratory set up in my living
room You know, it's it's not ideal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it works, you know, I've had some
really good success from it and Luckily,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know through especially through this
this podcast, you know, we've been meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: some amazing people in fact We just talked
to Jesse this morning and you know He was
[SPEAKER_00]: giving us all sorts of very valuable
information and I know unfortunately it
[SPEAKER_00]: was before we hit record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry people But I was able we got into
some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really did you know, and I know
actually come to think of it if you watch
[SPEAKER_00]: that podcast I don't say anything during
the entire thing and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is unfortunate, you know,
cuz I didn't really contribute to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are gonna see but I was very
fortunate because I was able to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse before we hit record and I had a Lot
of questions that would take me forever to
[SPEAKER_00]: Google and who knows if I'd even get the
right answer Directly answered for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know And it's just you want to touch
on any of those things that you felt were
[SPEAKER_01]: like little tidbits of information that
you're still now like chomping at the bit
[SPEAKER_00]: to start either testing out Yeah,
I mean so He let us know he was gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: share some of his protocols with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very interested to Kind of see how
he mixes stuff One thing he mentioned was
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like he's making his own and you
know the thing about when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with people too is we want to give them a
lot of space to to Say everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to say so there's gonna be times
where I bring questions and I don't get a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to ask it but It seems like he's
making his own nutrient solution for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you know Because he had a lot of
things that he was talking about where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in MS, you know, there's certain
Nutrients inside that mixture that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for cannabis because that
mixture is actually made for basil if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not mistaken You know, it's specifically
for growing basil, but you know as tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture has come more into the cannabis
community People found that it's it works
[SPEAKER_00]: good enough, you know for cannabis,
you know It's not perfect, but it works,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and you know, that's kind of the
theme for me You know, like sometimes if
[SPEAKER_00]: it works man, it works like let's let's
get some stuff accomplished, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Yeah, I mean I'm Very excited for the
next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be start start working with some
PGRs myself I have I have them already in
[SPEAKER_00]: my fridge and it's just a matter of
experimenting with the right ratios So I
[SPEAKER_00]: know I'm probably gonna pronounce it
Incorrectly again, but we have auxins and
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokinins which are two categories of the
main types of plant growth regulators and
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the tidbits that I've that's really
just kind of impacted me lately is You
[SPEAKER_00]: know auxins typically are you know to help
rooting like if you were just to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: break it down to the bare Necessities like
there's different auxins and they do
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, you know, depending on
what oxygen it is But overall the
[SPEAKER_00]: category, you know It's to help establish
roots and then cytokinins is to help
[SPEAKER_00]: establish, you know shoe growth or The way
that Jesse put it this morning is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, auxins are for below and
cytokinins are for above So, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's very valuable piece of
information But another thing that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: really learned is they work in conjunction
with each other so those plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators actually regulate each other as
well depending on the concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: each one so And for the listeners out
there, you know We're using the term plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth regulators and there is a lot of
stigma within the cannabis growing space
[SPEAKER_01]: about plant growth regulators simply
because some of them that are used to
[SPEAKER_01]: control flower structure growth can end up
leaving toxic residues that can be harmful
[SPEAKER_01]: to human consumption when combusted But a
lot of what we're talking about whether it
[SPEAKER_01]: be something that's like naphthalene
Acetic acid or end all three butyric acid
[SPEAKER_01]: or other auxins and cytokinins these
things occur naturally within the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're just applying them exogenously
so from outside the plant To help promote
[SPEAKER_01]: the same growth patterns that they would
promote within the plant endogenously And
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this right now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you clone and you use root growth
hormones, that's a plant growth regulator
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so you're you're probably already
utilizing that in your in your you know
[SPEAKER_00]: your techniques So one thing and again,
this is one of the many articles that I
[SPEAKER_00]: found and Jesse was able to kind of
confirm Is an high auxin to low cytokinin
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio favors root formation a low auxin
high cytokinin favors shoe formation and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a balanced auxin and cytokinin
maintains undifferentiated callus growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and The way that I view undifferentiated
calluses is it's very similar to stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cells where they're Malleable cells were
depending on the hormones that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to those cells Determine what
direction those cells grow and are they
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a shoot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several different, you know stages
that you can you can basically manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: using plant growth regulators Yep,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's a great touch on on kind of
your journey through and so far with
[SPEAKER_01]: Tissue culture and and I feel like that
also kind of brings us up to almost your
[SPEAKER_01]: current stage as a cultivator in general,
you know starting from a speaker moving
[SPEAKER_01]: into a rented room that eventually got
raided to now growing at home and
[SPEAKER_01]: following these different Sort of steps
and and develops developments within your
[SPEAKER_01]: your cultivation journey based on almost
sometimes it may have been barriers that
[SPEAKER_01]: you faced like with receiving contaminated
plants to wanting to Increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity as a grower overall within
that space that you have As most home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers know you limited space even with a
high plant count of say 99 plants is still
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could always have more space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always do more and Then with
limited time also comes other restraints
[SPEAKER_01]: but considering your journey has really
stayed something that you've kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: developed yourself and it doesn't sound
like there's been too many outside
[SPEAKER_01]: influences in terms of how the Cultivation
industry as a whole has sort of developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like you're not beholden to
working with a a commercial space or
[SPEAKER_01]: through a breeders collective that
requires a certain amount of output or A
[SPEAKER_01]: clone collective where you're providing
clones for resale to people So through
[SPEAKER_01]: your unique lens, what do you see within
the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry and community overall that you
feel like could change for the better Well
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's a good question I would
say as laws become more relaxed and It's
[SPEAKER_00]: not such a big deal to get into cannabis
as a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna see a more established
community not just a community of
[SPEAKER_00]: hobbyists and enthusiasts who you know may
potentially throw caution to the wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know to have an online presence,
you know, and even me, you know as someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who views himself as a professional,
you know, I still don't want to be all out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and you know, like I don't want to
be known as like the weed guy at work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I mean, I love cannabis and
I love growing and I've loved the
[SPEAKER_00]: community that comes with it too,
you know But it's not my whole life
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a lot of other things a
lot of other interests that you know get
[SPEAKER_00]: me excited and you know that I want to
work on you know, what one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm It's kind of taking a backseat because
the you know tissue culture, but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working on an album right now,
you know I know how to play like whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument that I'd pick up, you know,
and within the last it's been a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: over a year now, but I figured out how to
scream and so and it sounds fucking dope,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I I think it sounds pretty
good and with this whole studio here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I want to sit down and Finish
the album that I started, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it's 13 songs One of the songs is
an intro, but they're all recorded they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all mapped out and I just it's a matter of
rerecording them and redoing those vocals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, that's the Another thing
that I want to get accomplished,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I think that's gonna be for
sure when my goals this year I mean it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like because of the fact that we
have to still somewhat, you know Be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit withheld with From you know how
we expose ourselves outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate cannabis community It almost
sounds like you you'd like to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma be lifted a little bit more so that
you can incorporate these aspects of your
[SPEAKER_01]: life whether it be the consumption of
cannabis the breeding of cannabis the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing of cannabis and all those
different things that you now spend a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of your time on to be Just as easy to talk
about as the fact that you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: creating an album Of your own music,
you know through your own creative
[SPEAKER_01]: endeavors and that's something that you
can you know, you can go to the bar You
[SPEAKER_01]: don't drink but you can go out to dinner
You can go and hang out with friends from
[SPEAKER_01]: work and talk about your musical endeavors
in an open way that that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily require A mask to be pulled
down over your identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you may not necessarily feel the
same level of comfortability talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I I breed cannabis in my spare time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do cannabis Maristem tissue culture in
my spare time I have all these growing
[SPEAKER_01]: endeavors that I'm doing on my own time
and it feels like you almost have to cut a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of yourself out to be able to fit in
to the cookie that is the current US
[SPEAKER_00]: Political sphere, you know, I totally
agree like there's times where especially
[SPEAKER_00]: if I've been like hardcore Hardcore
focused on cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I've been tissue culturing every day,
you know Ten hour days and I'm like just
[SPEAKER_00]: up to my eyeballs and I get out to someone
where I have to be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: square So you say so to say sure I feel
like I'm so boring like I have nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about I'm like this person must think
that I'm just like the most bland person
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm like, dude I want To tell you
about all this fucking shit, but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything interesting on your
mind is not appropriate unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: right but you brought another point up to
like something I would love to see is a
[SPEAKER_00]: place you can go and smoke just like a
bar, you know a cannabis centered bar
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know after I stopped smoking
obviously I wasn't hanging out bars
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like as a kind of for me as a cannabis
user We don't have that place of community
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can go to and physically hang out
and smoke with each other and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to worry about you know You
know like cops rolling up or whatever is
[SPEAKER_00]: or I mean, yeah, we could do it at
someone's house But that's not it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not the same as being able to
go to a public place You know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: never know like oh my home is gonna show
up Maybe you know, like he's there
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes and you never know like who
you're gonna see and what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations in to come So I mean for
sure California's sober, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't get you And I feel like you
know using some form of social lubricant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether it be having a drink at
a bar or You know pulling out a joint and
[SPEAKER_01]: passing it around a bunch of friends at a
barbecue or something like that there's I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like there's just something in humans
that love that act of sharing something
[SPEAKER_01]: together and having this sort of either
talking point or something that helps
[SPEAKER_01]: release a little bit of the inhibitions
that are placed on us by either societal
[SPEAKER_01]: pressures or In-group pressures or other
things like that that make it so it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like hard to talk about this or that but
you know with a little something to help
[SPEAKER_01]: break the ice So to speak the mental ice
It does seem that like yeah Why can't
[SPEAKER_01]: there just be a place where people can
consume cannabis together and hang out and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk and do all the things that people do
at bars?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've heard from plenty of cops
that they'd rather deal with a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned people Than ten drunk people,
you know like ten drunk people are gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: cause An exorbitant amount more damage
potentially than a hundred stoned people
[SPEAKER_01]: could ever create Yeah, that that's a
really good point we do need some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption lounge or I Don't even know
what that would look like meet up and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can we can bake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it it should happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's Some states like New
York where it was written into the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation Initially that there would be
consumption lounges or places where the
[SPEAKER_01]: public could go and consume and it
wouldn't just be something That's a
[SPEAKER_01]: private club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they're they're
circumventing the law by making it
[SPEAKER_01]: membership only So your membership makes
it so that it's kind of like you own part
[SPEAKER_01]: of that property And so you're basically
smoking in your own home and they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you you can't do that But yeah,
there needs to be something there without
[SPEAKER_01]: so many loops and hoops to jump through
But okay, yeah, so I I see how you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Breaking down the stigma making it more
available for for society to partake in as
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole just like we do with all these
other things those are some great ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the community sort of Develop over the
next five to ten years I would say one
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing I want to see too and
especially as tissue culture becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent in the industry is I want to see
a lot more clean plants out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I don't want anyone to have to
deal with what I had to deal with last
[SPEAKER_00]: year and you know have to throw away
plants or risk contaminating the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: even working on for years, you know,
so hopefully we can move away from you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, shady people in the industry who are
here just to make a quick buck and You
[SPEAKER_00]: know get those people replaced with people
who actually you know have a passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and are here because You know,
they want to share the joy of growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, you know So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with that 100% I did want to
take an opportunity to do a couple shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs to some of the seed banks that I
really like This cool shirt that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from North Atlantic Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dope from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a like a woman run seed company in
Massachusetts and They have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: really good brands on that seed bank But
one thing that really stood out to me not
[SPEAKER_00]: not just to mention like whenever you
place an order they're super quick tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies, you know on whatever you order,
but anytime if I ever had a question or
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I was always able to reach out to
that company and they would promptly reach
[SPEAKER_00]: back with very very friendly Kind emails,
you know when I first started causing
[SPEAKER_00]: strains I reached out to them,
you know just to get some more information
[SPEAKER_00]: about getting brands on there and Super
nice encouraging email back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to give a shout out if
you're looking for a place to get seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's where I got a lot of my
genetics from North Atlantic seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that I really liked was
attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use attitude UK, which I think it's
based in Spain now But that was before I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of was aware of more than the North
Americans But I did get a lot of genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: from attitude So I just want to kind of
you know, cuz that was another portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: my research is figuring out where to get
these seeds from you know, so you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe Me pointing those those companies
out that I had some you know, good good
[SPEAKER_00]: success with it might Help some people out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, check out North Atlantic Seed Co
and attitude I understand that they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: US branch now if you're in America,
so you can order a lot quicker But you
[SPEAKER_00]: know shout out to those seed banks for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great little shout out great
little plug for Where to where to get good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love plugging things that that worked
for me, you know, right I don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not promoting anything,
you know and getting stuff in return like
[SPEAKER_00]: these are just companies That I appreciate
you know, like another one that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like actually here Let me let me grab this
piece because we can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little glass collection up there
but there's this company called glass
[SPEAKER_00]: berry or glass berry cupcake and I love
the old-school kind of cool bubbler and
[SPEAKER_00]: They just I spent a lot of time trying to
track down some of those pieces I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at and seen in head shops back
when I was in high school and I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really Find these like crazy ones or some
of them were just like too crazy where it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like they wanted like hundreds and
hundreds of dollars and yeah, it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: cool But I'm never gonna smoke out of that
cuz what I what happens if I drop it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah, so I found this this
company and they make Just some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: heady pieces that I was I was really
hoping to find cool Well, you know since
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of given a few recommendations
let's let's tie it into growing a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and what would be A tip or a piece of
advice that you would give to a new grower
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the experience that you have I
Would say It depends on you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really who I'm talking to you like if
they're just getting into it, you know It
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on your financial situation About
how much you want to put into this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Is this really a hobby that you
want to pursue or is this something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just kind of dipping your toe in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That will probably help determine how much
you should spend on your first setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Look what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you were you're growing like what's
that place like is it in an environment
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can control easily?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a place that you don't have to worry
about smells?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a place that you can get water
easily, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all concerns when it comes to
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So For me I went with for the majority The
tents I pardon me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have downstairs our gorilla gloat grow
tents they cost a little bit extra,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've had them for years now and and
they're still just as Good condition is
[SPEAKER_00]: when I first bought them nice However,
like this video son here, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a cheapo one because I needed
you know running out of space downstairs
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had a different video son one where
the zipper completely came off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: zipper track and there was no way for me
to put it back and eventually had to just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw that tent away, you know,
so I am a firm believer of buy nice or buy
[SPEAKER_00]: twice, but you have to have To keep in
mind How far are you gonna take this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is it really worth it to buy
really nice equipment right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow LED lights now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the technology has come to a
point where it's Not just really
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient, you know, whether it's you
know, just cost-wise, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're usually at a really good
price point They don't produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat Which that's always been a
traditional concern, especially with like
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodiums middle highlights
Like all those lights produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and you have to figure out how to
remove that heat, you know So LEDs is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot less of a concern and then power
consumption too They're able to be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient than your traditional
grower lights So, I mean it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more of a budget brand, but I've had
really good experience with Mars Hydro and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got those lights off by Amazon and
and Walmart so I mean you can basically
[SPEAKER_00]: find them anywhere but Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had really good Did you say Walmart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Amazon you know, a lot of those
companies are doing it where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be Like the the marketplace and
then they have a lot of different sellers
[SPEAKER_00]: on it So you're not gonna find those grow
lights at a Walmart, but you can find them
[SPEAKER_01]: on their site if I if I walked into a
Walmart and saw Mars Hydro Sitting on a
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say well, it looks like growing is
going to be legal soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Well growing is no longer cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh my god parents do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cool Motherfucker I don't want to
do this anymore Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Well, though, that's that's a good
piece of advice, you know I feel like the
[SPEAKER_01]: one That a lot of growers should take away
is or there's it's a it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: two-part Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know know how you what you want to
do to get into it Like know what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: aiming to get out of it Is it something
where you just are like I I want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: how cannabis plants grow then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you might want to start with
something cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a smaller tent Maybe use a closet
that you already have and just throw a
[SPEAKER_01]: light in there and see what happens or if
you're like no, I like I love cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow my own and I I know that
I'm gonna do this for a little bit then
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you might want to go about The idea
of buy buy once cry once and and buy
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself something that's a little bit
better or invest in yourself a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more depending on if you have a space
where you can build out part of a room
[SPEAKER_01]: like you did with that that first room
where you you framed it out and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put in a little bit more air
exchange and air control and environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: controls and things like that or a really
nice like a gorilla grow tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are probably I'd say those in like
AC infinities are probably Some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best tents you can get on the market right
now for their price points and I love AC
[SPEAKER_00]: infinity for I use them for inline fans
and just amazing So he's actually I have I
[SPEAKER_00]: just recently got some oscillating fans
that clip on your tent pole Like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: four inches height that you want it isn't
yeah workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking so sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those things are great I love that
they now have the different controllers
[SPEAKER_01]: that can interface all these different
pieces of equipment whether It be a
[SPEAKER_01]: humidifier dehumidifier your lighting
control your fan controls all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that you can tie in
together where that was something that was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much only reserved for commercial
grow spaces through things like grow link
[SPEAKER_01]: or a Roya or open sprinkler or all these
different programs that required some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of Subscription service and the initial
overhead cost was typically Like even at
[SPEAKER_01]: the base level where it's like,
oh this yeah This is enough for you to run
[SPEAKER_01]: one room at scale and then you look into
and it's like $18,000 with like $300 per
[SPEAKER_01]: month Subscription service and you're like
I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing in like five tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need I Can't afford that this
that's more than my entire setup just to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at it through a computer So a lot of
people that didn't make sense until a Roya
[SPEAKER_01]: started putting out a lot of really really
nice or not a right, sorry AC infinity
[SPEAKER_01]: started putting out a lot of really nice
Equipment for the home growers and another
[SPEAKER_01]: one that I like to shout out would be eco
wit ECO witt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a lot of their products on
Amazon but they have like a home hub that
[SPEAKER_01]: connects to a bunch of different wireless
pieces of monitoring equipment so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have Substrate monitoring for the moisture
content you can have environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring for You can go as deep as like
wind speed lighting humidity temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor pressure deficit and you can use all
those things to kind of make controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments within your environment to
make sure that you're growing as Optimally
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible for the plants So all those
things little things here and there that
[SPEAKER_01]: that new growers can use I feel like to To
make sure that they're doing something and
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can then correlate that to data
if if that's how they're mindful It works
[SPEAKER_01]: and if that's how they like to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a great thing for new
growers, dude I totally want to build my
[SPEAKER_00]: own hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like all the all the sensors and
Have I ever talked to you about raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: pies before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know what that is Yeah,
so just for our viewers that don't know I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I actually have one So a raspberry
pie is a single board computer Here's what
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like on the inside just one
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like the heat sink I got a little
fan but it's basically the size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: credit card and I have one of these
downstairs next to my internet router and
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually runs my website So I have it
as a web server, you know hosting my
[SPEAKER_00]: website But you can use them for all
different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking so cool dude my raspberry
pies And then in the same vein Arduino's
[SPEAKER_00]: Arduino is another single board computer
But utilizing those little single board
[SPEAKER_00]: computers you can Using like a bread board
which is if you remember from movies and
[SPEAKER_00]: you see those phone operators And they
have all those different switches and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of similar to that But you can
hook up those sensors and then write
[SPEAKER_00]: programs to interact with the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a sensor for Moisture in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one for it's supposed to tell you
like water temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's water temperature and
then there's water levels too,
[SPEAKER_00]: so There's this one sensor or yeah
Actually the sensor would sit at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and when the water level goes like
blow a certain point It will send a signal
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can tell if your water reservoir is
getting too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a pressure Sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are so probes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw this project on YouTube
called the raspberry pie bartender and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was used utilizing Pardon me these little
these little pumps and it was all hooked
[SPEAKER_00]: up to like One was hooked up to a bottle
of vodka one was hooked up to orange juice
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know a bunch of different drinks
and the mixers and Then on the front of
[SPEAKER_00]: what they built they can say I want a
screwdriver glass down under the dispenser
[SPEAKER_00]: and press and makes it and then the
computer using Those pumps would do you
[SPEAKER_00]: know X parts of vodka and then X parts of
orange used to make the screwdriver Is
[SPEAKER_01]: that just like peristatic pumps the ones
that kind of twirl against the silicone
[SPEAKER_01]: tubing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was like you can utilize those
with your nutrients with your pH up pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down and have those sensors and You could
basically have it dispense X amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in in your reservoir And then of
course you have you know the water mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: all around from your pumps and stuff And
then every 20 minutes it would do a
[SPEAKER_00]: reading of the pH and if the pH is off of
the range that you want You can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: same pumps put in, you know X amount of pH
up or pH down whatever it needs to go
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and how it cycle 20 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude I have all these ideas of
a project that I want to do to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen have you seen neurovine?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't so neurovine is basically
that exactly and it uses it like a
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculating pump and then a bunch of
peristatic pumps with the different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients as well as pH up and pH down and
a pH probe and sensor and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: also link it link it to your substrate
monitoring and It's all controlled through
[SPEAKER_01]: one hub.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you can make a copy of what
they're doing already so many people would
[SPEAKER_01]: find so much use in that and if it can all
be ran off of Raspberry Pi and people can
[SPEAKER_01]: you know if you open source that that that
software for the The little Raspberry Pi
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be a lot of people that would
benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I want to see if I could do it,
you know, that's I mean, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a theme with everything I do It's
like can I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know another thing to you know,
cuz I know we're getting to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where we should probably wrap up One piece
of advice I want to give growers to is
[SPEAKER_00]: Things don't have to be perfect for you to
get results, you know When I first you
[SPEAKER_00]: know way before I had my little company
here and before I had any aspirations of
[SPEAKER_00]: being you know A breeder back when I was
learning about pollen and you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques There was one point where I had
a ton of plants in my backyard shed You
[SPEAKER_00]: know a bunch of males that I was just like
let's just flower them out We'll collect
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen one at a time and if I get
around to utilizing the pollen cool But if
[SPEAKER_00]: not no big deal at least I don't have to
keep these males alive anymore You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're not high priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these other males I'm I know for
sure I want to do runs with but these ones
[SPEAKER_00]: are maybe so I collected a bunch of
different pollen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was out in my shed in the
backyard Somehow we got a spider my
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation and it was bad Like to the
point where I was lucky that I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the plants past three weeks of flower
Such a bad infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did is I got um,
I went to Walmart and I got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: moving boxes and They're like
medium-sized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like a dollar fifty two bucks a
pop and I would set that up I would lay
[SPEAKER_00]: tin foil on the bottom Of it and so,
you know, I taped up the bottom or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you fold the the bottom So it's not
gonna fall out and then at the top I would
[SPEAKER_00]: on two sides across from each other You
know cut like three holes and then I would
[SPEAKER_00]: feed string in across the top and I would
hang the buds So they're hanging at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the cardboard and then in the pond
would fall down to you know the tin foil
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bottom there and So I was like well
fuck man, like I don't want to bring any
[SPEAKER_00]: of this in my house It's infested with
spider mites You know, and I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get spider mites off the plant
material, but I'm gonna still try to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect the pollen so one by one I took
all those plants and I you know put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in those boxes and I put them in my garage
and I'm in Southern California here where
[SPEAKER_00]: our summers are getting, you know 115 no
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was in the garage for about two
months in summer heat and By all accounts
[SPEAKER_00]: on everything that I've researched that
pollen should have not been viable at all
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have been just completely dead
and you know, again, I was just Doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: best I could you know, like What am I
gonna do just throw it all out might as
[SPEAKER_00]: well try so There was a point before Yeah,
this is way before I did my My company and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I had at that point before I
did the line using the pineapple passion
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth email I collected some of that from
you know, that instance when it was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garage again, it shouldn't been viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a vial of it and A couple months
down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having trouble cloning one of my
plants that was already in flower and so
[SPEAKER_00]: in order for me to be like well You know,
it's I had the potential right now to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: my pineapple upside-down cake plant
because you know I haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully have a root and it's already
week two of flower So I took that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that I collected again shouldn't have been
viable at all And I used my little
[SPEAKER_00]: paintbrush and I painted, you know a
couple Of the bigger nugs on that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and lo and behold they were fully
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some seeds in there So that's
awesome to everyone is shoot for
[SPEAKER_00]: perfection, but don't let it get in the
way of progress, you know Because you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised even if things aren't optimal
about what you can pull off You know just
[SPEAKER_00]: write on give your chance to try it,
you know Right on that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way to kind of end the the
talk about cannabis cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding I feel like you know perseverance
and persistency will really pay off in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of ways if you if you don't let things
stand in your way in terms of failures or
[SPEAKER_01]: how someone else says it has to be done or
you know, just because you you Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because it's it's been told to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's absolutely no no way that that can
work if you think that it can work
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when it comes to something
that's as esoteric as a plant where like
[SPEAKER_01]: we still don't know all the different
processes that the roots have and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: Relations that they'll have with mycelial
colonies like endophytes like we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not a hundred percent sure on all
these different things so when someone
[SPEAKER_01]: says That they're a hundred percent sure
someone won't something won't work that's
[SPEAKER_01]: when you can be sure that they're full of
shit because that You can't be a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent on almost anything in this life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only sits deal in absolutes Only only
sits
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, only sets deal in absolutes,
that's a great callback Love that All
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get into a couple of these
little wrap-up questions Just so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: wrap this up for the for the guests or for
the listeners here So what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, man I mean, there's a lot of
contenders, but I got a I gotta say SFEOG
[SPEAKER_00]: nice That's just such a solid and the
history that I have with that strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's it's always gonna be really
close to my heart and Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've lost the my SFEOG clone that
I had from OG life back in 2020 I have it
[SPEAKER_00]: on my shelf here in tissue culture,
but that culture is not looking too good,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's oh no It's been a learning
process, but no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our homie Gabby has assured me that you
know when I'm ready, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can You know purchase it from him
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool You know, no worries, you know and
one thing too like that I've really had to
[SPEAKER_00]: Accept in in my heart because it's so
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all these strains, you know But I
gotta remember that you know, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that I've made but the majority of
these breeder cuts that I have They're
[SPEAKER_00]: just someone else's creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's not always it's not exactly my
responsibility to make sure that these
[SPEAKER_00]: strains don't die out You know because
someone else probably has them so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's that's part of the
process too is learning to let go You know
[SPEAKER_01]: learning to accept what is and what is not
I've held on to plants for way too long in
[SPEAKER_01]: the commercial setting just because You
hear how much they cost and you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to lose that but you know
Most most people it's like you break that
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just send you another cut if you
fuck it up It's not that expensive to just
[SPEAKER_01]: pay for shipping again You already showed
the initiative of wanting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a that's a good little
extra bit of tidbit there little bonus
[SPEAKER_01]: bonus tidbit of information for new
growers is Be okay with letting go of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants don't know don't hold on to plants
for too long if they They're not worth it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether it be health their pest
pressure pathogen pressure just inability
[SPEAKER_01]: to clone Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's there's plenty more
plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already pretty deep in it right now
with my my tissue culture stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get to the point where I
have to be like, okay Well, maybe this
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe try to hold on to all these strains
isn't working out So, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean with tissue culture though You have
that ability to hold on to a lot more than
[SPEAKER_01]: you would otherwise and once you get your
methodology Down it shouldn't be something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is like even a question You'll you be
able to put stuff in in culture and kill
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, and I've already done that like
When I first started I had so much
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence and so this gelato 41 I thought
this and I've never grown this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I bought from Beat
breeders direct, you know, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: little tidbit about breeders direct,
you know, we're gonna be sells his clones
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I I bought that plant just to
put into culture so That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hey if you're going all-in might
as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know like well, I mean the way I
look at it to you is I'm very fortunate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know where again, you know because of
my job it pays for all my bills and then
[SPEAKER_00]: some so I do have somewhat of a disposable
income where I can just kind of throw
[SPEAKER_00]: money, you know at At those strains and
hopefully I can get it to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure I mean some of those strains
that I bought like this the strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel I'm not so sure if I'm gonna be
able to have a get through the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture process and you know, that's okay,
you know, like an expensive lesson,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Every every time that I got a new
order of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really did help propel me to continue
working So, you know, even if not if it if
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't work out, that's fine But at
the end of this I'm gonna have so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more knowledge on tissue richer than I did
when I first started So that's just as
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable as the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I like I look at to like
I Been holding on to my strains for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long and here we are It hasn't even been a
year and I've been making all these
[SPEAKER_00]: connections in the community with other
You know awesome growers who have their
[SPEAKER_00]: own collections and now it seems kind of
silly that I held on so hard and I tried
[SPEAKER_00]: Working, you know against all these
different odds, you know, like we even get
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance to talk about some of the pests
that I've encountered You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I actually successively like what
three years ago was able to save Six of my
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and you know, this is way before I
had a ton of strains, but six of my
[SPEAKER_00]: strains from spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a My infestation side who knows
where it came from whether it was the pets
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have or my fiance loves,
you know houseplants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very big potential for Infecting
your your grow space, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way FYI guys if you get plants from
my home depot or you know Lowe's or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever like chances are they probably
have pests on them So when you bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: inside you probably bring those pests
inside but yeah, I mean I saved all those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but it was a Process and it was
very stressful for me, you know so now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I I know all these people were they
have amazing collections themselves and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know like legitimate growers people who
aren't gonna be selling me like disease
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, you know, like it doesn't feel like
such a gigantic responsibility for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that these strains stay alive
because if they don't stay alive Chances
[SPEAKER_00]: are someone else still has them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know for sure Like let go of that
that stress, but it's just weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it's just it's just a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's billions of them out there Yeah,
well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just one more question then who is your
favorite breeder of all time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question I mean If you had
to choose a breeder where you could choose
[SPEAKER_01]: any of their work to restart your own
breeding processes Let's let's go about it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way because that might help Narrow it
down a little bit for your specific
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario So thinking about that,
I would probably go With one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that have been working on the
same line for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I forget which interview we were
talking about this but we touched on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that All these like even even these
kind of higher-end companies like exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the stuff that I've grown from
them, you know, I've grown Maybe five
[SPEAKER_00]: seven under ten strains from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a variety Of stuff and
everything is has been interesting or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know something that was at least worth
keeping around for a couple runs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so they have some really good
stuff, but that being said every single
[SPEAKER_00]: year they have like a new line of seeds
and When you think about it, those are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably just all f1s, you know,
like they don't really talk about their
[SPEAKER_00]: you know their Breeding process with it or
anything like that, but chances are those
[SPEAKER_00]: are just your initial crossing of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not stabilized So if I were to
start over again, I would probably go with
[SPEAKER_00]: a company That's been working with the
same lines for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're you're more likely to get
something That's probably like an f4 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, so Brothers Grimm is
one that I grew out that I really liked,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the c99 I think we talked about
that earlier with me thinking it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: most hallucinogenic strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not exactly true, but You know,
they've been growing c99 and there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got its own history behind it and if I
were to say what I like I learned from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I might tell it incorrectly
because it's not my history to tell But
[SPEAKER_00]: you know another one that I just recently
got and Who knows what I'm gonna be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to these seeds, but I got some
black widow from mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, you know and For our viewers who
know cannabis history, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's The the main breeder responsible
for white widow, you know, it was it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: team up for greenhouse back in the day and
You know, they split ways, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was able to keep his his breed in
stock, but he had to leave Behind the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of white widow and that you know,
he basically read redubbed it black widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So They still offer black widow seeds,
you know, and so actually I bought two
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was during Black Friday,
so I got 60 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these days I'm gonna do a legit
black widow run and See if I can find
[SPEAKER_00]: something very interesting from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so just I kind of Said a lot of
things but really I would find one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those companies that I've been around For
years and years and years and have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of the same strains So you know
that chances are is probably gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: stable because there's a there's so many
F1s out there I mean, I'm guilty of it too
[SPEAKER_00]: everything on my sites in F1 And I mean we
got into a little bit of why I only have
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s right now and that's not gonna be
forever I don't want to forever have just
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s, but I feel like you can have a lot
more stability with someone that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on those strains for years versus
just the flavor of the week I agree with
[SPEAKER_01]: that wholeheartedly it makes me think of
someone else we've talked about before in
[SPEAKER_01]: the show skunk master flex of skunk house
genetics where he has his Larry og and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's taken all the way to almost I
think last I've heard it was like an f9 or
[SPEAKER_01]: f10 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know just really intense og
Dominant terpene and structure profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: that he then bred into all the different
burger strains like the Donnie burger the
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO or not the sorry he bred it with GMO I
think to get like Donnie burger and Han
[SPEAKER_01]: Solo burger and triple burger and hash
burger and all these different burger
[SPEAKER_01]: strains where it's like just intense
savory notes that you would find within
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO or og or different things like that so
I could I totally can say that that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be something I would probably do as well
if it were something where I needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: then take those genetics and continue to
breed with them for whether it be medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: or effect or structure or something like
that it would make a lot of sense to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose something that's already been
worked well down the filial generation
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean because think about everything
now too like F1 after F1 after F1 after F1
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know it just I mean you you've
probably run into the same thing but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown so many different strains from seeds
and a lot of the seeds a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains will have our hermit or two in
them you know it's just it's one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things about modern cannabis and it's
because we've been mixing so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and not really giving us
a chance to work with it and try to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those you know I guess you could
say bad genes from you know the gene pool
[SPEAKER_00]: so I mean so I mean I've learned a hell of
a lot since my first couple lines too and
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean really the direction I was heading
in with making those you know those lines
[SPEAKER_00]: where I plan on working with those
combinations those those new strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made you know in the future you know
that's the right direction but you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to narrow it down and make sure that
I can stabilize you know some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I've created so that's
definitely gonna be a gold mine but right
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're just I'm stuck in the middle of
this tissue culture stuff and I'm even
[SPEAKER_00]: considering once I have completely you
know reverting the genetics back through
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture and I've tested them again
make sure that they're completely clean of
[SPEAKER_00]: viroids and fungal infections and
everything I'm considering probably doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some clone offerings we didn't even get a
chance to talk about it I know we've
[SPEAKER_00]: probably talked about in other shows but
another very appealing aspect of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture is the fact that you can store
genetics on a shelf for months and months
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time you know and not only does it
take up very little space compared to a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant but you don't have to worry
about feeding and watering it like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just chilling in the container you know so
the fact that you can kind of store
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and have an actual library where
it's on the shelf and you can pull it out
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're checking out a book and you
know like I think that's really awesome so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a huge tool for a breeder yeah
absolutely I mean so I think my future is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be you know probably some limited
clone offerings and getting back to you I
[SPEAKER_00]: probably want to do another f1 or line or
two just so I can do some feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's another thing that people
ask you know is they're either really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited that I have only regular seeds or
they're very bombed I don't have any you
[SPEAKER_00]: know feminized ones so right I might do
some feminized runs but I really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: start drawing down on those f1s I made
awesome man well you know I'm sure like
[SPEAKER_01]: myself included the community can't wait
to see what continues for cosmic strains
[SPEAKER_01]: and how your breeding journey continues
and your tissue culture journey continues
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully we can in the future then do
another episode where we can touch on
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're at then compared to where you
are at now and kind of see how your
[SPEAKER_01]: continued breeding journeys develops yeah
I think it'd be interesting especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to pull off hydroponics in the
tent you know that we can do another way
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow and I can you know hopefully
bring back some of the growing pains I had
[SPEAKER_00]: through that process you know so
absolutely you know I'm hard-headed if
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing you know and I'll keep banging my
head against the wall until I figure it
[SPEAKER_01]: out you know well with that perseverance
you're going to provide a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: information for the community that's going
to be value for a bunch of other grow
[SPEAKER_01]: growers so you know cosmic thank you so
much for joining me today and I really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate your time and telling your
story I really think that it'll help a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of other people look at what they're doing
not only within cannabis but outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and and think is is this
something that I want to do because the
[SPEAKER_01]: next journey is literally just you taking
the incentive to start it yourself you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and just taking things one step at a
time you know don't look at sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't look at the big picture you just
have to look at your immediate goals and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know because it's a marathon you know
it's not something you can just sprint and
[SPEAKER_00]: finish you know you have to really just
continuously work at it so I mean that
[SPEAKER_01]: applies a lot of things in life you know
yeah absolutely well again thank you so
[SPEAKER_00]: much and we'll talk to you soon yeah thank
