[SPEAKER_02]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_02]: and seeds, and they are the only place
that you can get the Gabby Staten Island
[SPEAKER_02]: collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Gabby Staten Island with another
episode of Your Weed Stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: This week we've got our special guest,
Boston Bob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we start, I just want to say a
couple of words.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're recording this on New Year's Eve and
I had gotten a message from Bob that he
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted or that he enjoyed the show and
that if we wanted to have him on the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: that he'd love to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I asked him a little background about
himself, and I'm going to read this,
[SPEAKER_03]: he says, I'm a hobby breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I release seeds through FCP with all
proceeds going to Peter for the good work
[SPEAKER_03]: he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing podcasts for a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: My main focus is on projects and
methodology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to share for small growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll say I smoked in the 70s,
hint at my age.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first IG account closed two years ago
with 900 picks and 15,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first thing I thought to myself
was, you know, this is great because I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been having some major players on the
show, like Kevin Jadri and Michael Wolf
[SPEAKER_03]: Siegel, who I think is super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to try to have some smaller,
more, I would say, you know, regular
[SPEAKER_03]: people doing the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we agreed and we scheduled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then yesterday I called Bob up,
you know, just to talk a little bit before
[SPEAKER_03]: the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to get too much
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because I like to be surprised when I
do the podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like my reactions to be genuine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want him to retell a story,
but he did start to tell me a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, I was just blown away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while, um, Bob may not be as well
known as Kevin Jadri or some of the other
[SPEAKER_03]: people that we're going to interview on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast, he seems like an amazing person
with a compelling story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I know you guys are going to enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob is a professional and he does not,
um, he does not sell cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that he grows, he gives away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because he's a professional,
he wants to stay anonymous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are not going to show Bob's face on
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to look at my ugly
mug, this entire show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're wondering why you can't see
Bob, that's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, um, Boston Bob,
tell us your weed story.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, thank you for nice
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a pleasure to be on the show with
you today, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do I start?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like you to start with your first
cannabis experiences, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you first started smoking,
when you first started growing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, funny stories about your past
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we can work towards
the cool things you're doing today with
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding and, you know, I don't want to
give up too much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get it to males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I liked how we, we started,
we started and stopped that conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to, the conversation
will, will weave in now wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the very beginning,
um, I probably smoked, not probably cause
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked weed in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in private school and, uh,
it was more a school for wealthy
[SPEAKER_00]: delinquents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and my parents didn't have money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my grandparents paid and I get sent to
private school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked weed in seventh grade and
actually, uh, I got caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told my mother, it's the first time I
have a smoke pot and I can't believe I got
[SPEAKER_00]: caught the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I went back to that school and then in
eighth grade, I got caught again with four
[SPEAKER_00]: other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let the other four go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four people back into school and I got
kicked out permanently and I told my
[SPEAKER_00]: mother, I can't believe only the second
time I smoked pot, I got caught again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm thinking she probably didn't
believe it, but you know, I was,
[SPEAKER_00]: was it true?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke a weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was a very early introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and back in those days, we weren't
even getting really brick weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we got Panama red and Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were probably the two main strains
or, uh, they didn't even have names of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains back then, but we were smoking
Panama red and Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: On occasion, if stuff was really dry,
you'd get some brick weed, but brick weed
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, um, didn't come till later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always smoked pretty good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, uh, at least in the
East coast, it was called a lid and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: either four finger lid or a five finger
lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it was 15 bucks cause it was
Panama red and that's what we smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the beginning for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, going through high
school and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then out of high school and in my
twenties, I think for a while I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good waking Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another turning point was,
I think I was a sophomore in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have been about 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought my first pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was Mexican brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid $90 for the pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that was, that was my early
adventures as a young age and I smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then frankly, in my mid twenties,
I kind of got out of it and I was out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the game for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you stopped smoking cannabis for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd smoke a couple of times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I went, I literally went from,
you know, I'd smoke in bed before I got
[SPEAKER_00]: out of bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in my mid twenties, it was,
um, I, I had different focuses and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of gradually stopped smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in, you know, when I was in high
school, I had some plants in a closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, who knows if I even knew what
1212 meant back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I was trying to grow weed and I
grew it in, in the, in my basement closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my, in my mother's house.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year was this approximately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, 74 and 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were you using for light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just a flur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, a lamp, just, just a lamp hung
upside down in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I honestly, I don't even remember
smoking any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember trying to grow it,
get it in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, cause there was always
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You re any weed you got had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other thing that I remember,
and I remember this very distinctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it was probably 1971 or 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked my first since EMEA didn't have a
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that today that I could
think of that looks like it is like fruity
[SPEAKER_00]: pebbles, like it looked like fruity
pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other stuff was, you know,
Panama red was dark green with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of red hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Acapulco gold was, you know,
green gold weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always pretty consistent in terms
of the color through the whole bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody got this weed and all we
called it, it was just called since EMEA
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, had some reds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a little bit of yellows and greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was really, it was a good
looking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very up weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, worst case, it was a sativa
hybrid back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing we knew was it came
from the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first time I ever smoked
since EMEA had no, obviously no seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still remember it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the end of 71 or the
beginning of 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big change for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I guess my real reintroduction was
probably 10 years ago, 2014, 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the name of the dispensary,
but I bought a strain called Cindy White
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just absolutely loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was up, happy, high, clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me realize that I could grow
weed and make weed in any direction I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted because of the different stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I kind of dove back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably been 10 years,
almost 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just started collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, I did a bunch of emerald
cups and met a whole bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: did Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: and really just started collecting and
building a library.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, I probably have 300 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is if I'm doing breeding or
I'm doing a project, they all revolve
[SPEAKER_00]: around a line or two lines I want to bring
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got this huge line and I've got
this whole library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in addition, I'm not even,
I don't do a ton of seeds anymore unless
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing some kind of hunt because
somebody else will have done the work and
[SPEAKER_00]: picked a really good cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can use a cut of that cultivar,
which we can talk about a little later on
[SPEAKER_00]: from different people out in the,
you know, in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody else has done that work and
I've done that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few strains where, you know,
I find a really, really good plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've passed the plant out to a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned before, I don't sell
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't put any restrictions on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can do whatever they want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good plants, a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't have been able to do some
of the stuff I've done if people didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: give me good plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep that circle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gotta be, at least five or six
years ago, I'll on Instagram, I've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 15,000 followers, you know,
a bunch of kids, a bunch of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it was, it was a, you know,
it's a, it's a good amount of following,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was not my intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned to you the other day,
Instagram is my notebook, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older and it's easier to
forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of my notepads and in addition
to my notepads where I'm keeping track of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and, and, and, and writing
everything down, when I do something,
[SPEAKER_00]: I post it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot easier than digging through
notebooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just flipped back through the pictures
and I'm like, okay, I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this went in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this is how many days I have left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like Instagram because it's like my
video notebook or, you know, that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my video notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so show the, I sent you one picture of
the plant in a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the last one I sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it said, I think three, number one,
or basically it's a, it's, it's an honest
[SPEAKER_00]: eight foot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant is PR one Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened is that a male or is it a
female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I posted it when, when I opened my new,
Instagram account a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that as one of the first pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what happened with, so it's a,
it won't be too long, but I was at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald cup in 2016 and spent a bunch of
time with John at snow high seats and
[SPEAKER_00]: snow's always had some really good land
race stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he likes the Esoteric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we, we hung out for a pretty
good amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really enjoyed talking to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a couple of things back and
forth since then, but what he did was he
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a bud of Panama red and on the
bud, it ended up, I think there were
[SPEAKER_00]: always 40 seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did one grow and it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it wasn't special, but it was
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did another grow and I picked
a male, which was Panama red for just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, notes for myself so that I know
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We separate the males and we start growing
out the females and literally three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower, you know, where everything
should be showing and the pistols are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming and it's, you know, three weeks is
pretty good to heaven flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at one of the plants that it was
a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the entire time the, the male never
showed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally around the third week and
flower realized there's a male in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was an absolutely beautiful plant
thought it was going to be a great girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I junked the,
the original male that I had selected and
[SPEAKER_00]: took him and put him in that cellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the picture you have of that
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that male literally was probably four
and a half, five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the plant, the top two
feet of the plant, this not eat this
[SPEAKER_00]: barely any leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just straight flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it, it, it pushed out flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't believe, I mean,
we were joking around when we collected
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, we collected on a full length
mirror, like a, like the mirror had to be
[SPEAKER_00]: five feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you had to do is just take the mirror
near the plant and shake the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was joking around at the time
that we were collecting pollen with a
[SPEAKER_00]: shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so, and I probably bred that plant
over the next four or five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least a dozen times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something about that plant is,
you know, it's, um, the photo that we have
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you know, it's, it's not the best
photo and it's on Instagram and you sent a
[SPEAKER_03]: screenshot of it, but it looks like a
Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, often people will talk
about like, you know, a female plant that
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: This actually from this photo,
it looks like a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a pretty incredible photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept them or I, you know, you clone,
you know, some days you're, you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: all you're doing is clone and stuff,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I kept him going for four or
five years and everything I hit the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up with more potency and
karyophyllene either went to the top or
[SPEAKER_00]: became one of the top couple of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the stuff was, had a little bit of
spice in it and it, it wasn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper, but it was more spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it increased the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in every cross I did, you know,
we, um, yeah, we hit a bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I hit five different orange
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, doesn't seem to didn't seem to mix too
well with some of the blueberry stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it mixed really, really well with the
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept most of it on the fruit side
because then you get the spice and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one, um, called Booper,
which was bag of oranges from,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Randy useful seeds who, um,
sadly passed away last spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we went through five different
orange strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the Booper stories kind of,
it'll be quick, but it's really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't need to be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know, but I was going off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about the Panama red and
one of the, one of the crosses and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the interactions on, on Instagram,
but on the Booper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get bag of oranges, we grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I get a beautiful female and they're
all fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, this one turned black when it was
finishing and it was absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pollinate it with the Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a four foot plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I start from the bottom and you know,
I'm crushing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saving the Keefe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm literally just looking for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care about the,
the weed so much as getting the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got to the apical bud, the last bud
on the top, there was one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this entire breeding, I got one
single seed and you know, Murphy's law,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't keep a cut of the bag of oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't go, so I couldn't go back
and do it again with the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew out that one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's bag of oranges and Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just named it Booper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the guys around here still have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's, there's a couple of guys that
it's their regular stable, no matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: else they grow, they keep it growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually lost the plant about a year and
a half ago and gut it back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about two months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stays around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unbelievable plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and because it was only the one
seed and I was afraid of losing it again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I created a bunch of, uh, S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reversed it, cloned it, hit it with,
uh, you know, hit the clone with the
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse plant and then made a bunch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then maybe four years ago when
Randy was running useful seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I gave him a bunch to give away his
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just, the Booper is just a
really good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really so so, um, the weeds really,
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the, the good ones
that came out of the Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I grew that beast, uh,
story I want to tell is, I want to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: about Instagram is, you know, you get,
you get all these different feeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see in all these different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and this guy, uh, his name is
Will lived in Seattle and he crossed a
[SPEAKER_00]: killer Malawi to a Punter Roya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Punter Roya, he actually picked up
in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he went down to Columbia for two months
trying to sort, um, the red, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Punter Roya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said after a bow, you know,
so he finally, um, um, one of the highs he
[SPEAKER_00]: had, which his description is if you're
sitting down and you smoke the Punter
[SPEAKER_00]: Roya, he said, it feels like you being
elevated off the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, you're boxing up off of the
chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he way he brought those back to Seattle
and did a, did a couple of crosses and he
[SPEAKER_00]: did this, this killer Malawi and he called
it red death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how many he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a dozen maybe growing and this one
red death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number six just looked like a perfect
match for the Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted the plant and he doesn't know
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Panama red, so we'll, we'll hunted
the Punter Roya and then he did the killer
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi cross and then he's got a dozen of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing in Seattle and again,
nobody knows who anybody is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I contact them and I'm like,
I'd like a cut of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know, I'm coming from
Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming out to Seattle, um,
on a business trip and I'd like the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think it was probably a
month between the conversation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: time I was going to Seattle and I'm all
psyched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now I get to, to do these,
you know, these nice, I get some Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Punter Roya, which I like with
the Panama red, the Malawi adds a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, a little bit of spike, a little bit,
a little bit of zest to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think it's going to be a really
good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going back and forth and then
about a week before I fly out,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, he calls me up and he said,
um, I'm not going to be around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's hard to frame it,
but like I said, you don't know who's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be who on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden I think I'm going to
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to get this plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right before I get to go out
there, the person's telling me that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that he's not going to be around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little bit bummed out and,
um, he calls me back two days later and he
[SPEAKER_00]: said, look, I rent a house and my
landlord's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll let you in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't know me from Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I fly out is his landlord meets me
at the house, go inside the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how he showered because the
bathroom was full of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back porch was full of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally, he left me some,
um, you know, not chicken masses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left me some scissors and two,
two water bottles to take the cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he left all the stuff for me,
opened up his house, wasn't even around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go out on the back and his landlord knew
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His landlord was in a house close to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all fine with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I literally went out in the back
porch and I, you know, there was a 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 plants, whatever the words on that back
porch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I knew the plant right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, um, I went over and I checked and
it was, it was the, it was the number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a bunch of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I went to a supermarket
because this was stuff still really
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't, um, you know, legal yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did is I bought a salad and I
took the like three or four cuts and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped them into paper towels and then
stuck lettuce over them and put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing, like I was taken a salad and I
brought it on the plane with me and flew
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Boston.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is one of the most interesting ways
that I've heard of smuggling clones or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, moving clones from place to
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I might have to use that in the future
because I think it's actually a,
[SPEAKER_03]: a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, so I brought it back in a salad,
um, bread, bread, that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I typically do, I've made a couple
of, of different decisions, but 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time I'm just naming stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of the parents,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think it's easier to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people are tracking stuff down and
they want something from a line,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easier to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I named it Panama red death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the plants Panama red death 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a guy in the, in the, I believe
he's in the black market in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's been selling it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually sent him the cut that the cut
exists a couple of places, but not many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's, it's been three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been at least three or four years,
maybe more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, it's, um, it's, it's one of
his more popular strains that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't have that plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I'll eventually get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back from him to do another line with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, that Panama red death
turned out to be really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd actually, I, um, I get into the point
now where I've got to go to F threes on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but the few seeds, um, that were
available that I've put on, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the FCP, FCP site of over at Daga,
they, the, those move right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the interesting part is when I
give them to, to Peter to help raise money
[SPEAKER_00]: for the future cannabis project,
I generally don't even say prices like he
[SPEAKER_00]: can sell them for whatever he wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can do freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my way of helping him do the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, and getting the seeds out so
people can grow, hopefully some really
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get the plant, get it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still never met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's never met me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd let me in his house, hooked me up
with the landlord and then set me up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment so that I could bring the
clones back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this, I'm not real clear on the
time, but it was probably a year later.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going to a wedding in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, stop by and have dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stopped by with his girlfriend,
the wife and I had dinner and there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, theoretically they were going to
have dinner and head up to Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they left around one 30 at two o
'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we just sat there for hours and
hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and as it turns out he's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He opened up, uh, like a bed and breakfast
in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left Seattle, um, took the young lady
and they set up shop in Columbia,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether I ever get down there to visit him
or not, who will be interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, yeah, really, really good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had no idea what he looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: No idea on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, stop over for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up, you know, I don't know
five or six hours just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really nice, but that was,
uh, yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I wanted to say is these are the type
of stories that this channel is all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good people out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good people out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There really is, you know, and it's
sometimes you feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody in the world is shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden you just meet,
meet great people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had that experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lately because of the podcast,
I just feel so blessed that I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting such awesome people and making
such great friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to say this, you know,
right now that I hope that this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning of a lifelong friendship for us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people complain about Instagram
and Instagram can be awful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're doing stuff in legal states.
[SPEAKER_00]: That don't have any issues and they still
give the cannabis guys a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of sucks, you know,
and then you get the kids out there that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they don't finish reading the
sentence before they're replying back on
[SPEAKER_00]: something negative because they know
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's the plus of losing my
account before is I've lost those accounts
[SPEAKER_00]: and now I'm dealing with people who love
the plan and, and, and like making good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you mentioned before how I
don't take any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trade either, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm in a unique position where I
don't really need the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually, I'm in a position where I
can't even take the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take nothing and I don't even trade,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if I trade then trade implies,
you know, value for value and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: could be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather give and not expect
anything in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that can happen is I can
get something in return sometime in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm only going to be happy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to think, wow, that was a
bad trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's a really positive
experience all the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll say about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I heard you say that yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we chatted briefly is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand, you know,
you don't need to trade and, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could trade if you just went into
it with little expectation, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like if somebody says, Hey, look,
I have something really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to trade you for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, you would be giving it to
him anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't get something that's,
you know, awesome, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_03]: matter, you know, but there's a potential
that somebody is giving you something
[SPEAKER_03]: really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't understand the, the no trading
for that reason, just because,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the other thing is, you know,
someone, someone's trying to give
[SPEAKER_03]: something to you that they really want you
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's see, you said it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade implies value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not looking for any value out of
the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm looking to get it out to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, frankly, I mean,
when it comes down to it, why am I doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it for my ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to go boss to Bob's weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for accolades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, I it's, it's funny hearing me
say it, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, it's, it's an ego thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, you know, I, I've done a bunch of
stuff before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my OCD, which is going to keep me
wired in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be able to give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, and then, and so I want the value
proposition for me doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like actually right now in
Massachusetts, there's two legal entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of them's got 60,000 square
feet and other one's got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: acres that they do sungrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I w I work with them in terms of the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now in Massachusetts,
it's funny because I was thinking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: am I a home grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I a craft grower or a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm not really a home grower
because I got five different strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: are right now in dispensaries in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing that because those guys
don't have to pay anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll work with them to get the right
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they can run a bench
so I can see 80 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then I can make a selection that
I want from males and females that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: never do on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would take me years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, for me, when I'm going
through stuff, maybe I go through 40
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at a time, but to be honest,
to be able to go through a hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: make that selection, you know,
I, that's a pretty unique opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weeds good enough where the
dispensaries can sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the kids are still buying by the
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be strong enough for the
dispensaries to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this one place has an iron D
room, so they'll try different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, here's one I've never even
tested, but the parents are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this and this is likely to happen,
but you know, we all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best intentions.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just because everything's great,
doesn't mean the weeds going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having somebody who's okay doing R and
D with you, it's a huge plus for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it helps me get to my goal of
producing really good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if either of those facilities,
um, Greg chem dog is involved in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know that he's, um, in
Massachusetts, um, you know, working at a
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not on the two that I'm, that I'm
doing stuff with now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not a part to either of them because
I know who owns this other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's a massive
facility and they're really good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that, that's an advantage
that I have also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to think of another Panama red
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the booper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Panama red death that came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been a really great plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk about the Panama red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any other breeding stories
that you want to tell or stories about
[SPEAKER_03]: people that you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so I'm Jr at Saturn Ilya seeds in the
last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pen, I think the Panama red would go
really good with federated federation,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think he sells seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years back to try to get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent him pollen and it didn't take,
and then he sent me a cut of his mother
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I tried pollen and that didn't
take, and I got Panama red death pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that was an accident and I got
maybe 20 seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got, I got very, very few seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but because of the Panama red and
because we were both trying to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually I'll, I'll, you know,
I'll have to go to F threes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the Panama red back into that
federation, Hawaiian sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he, I think he's up to either F
seven or F eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really nice and stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an absolute, you know, he gave me,
he sent me a cut and that the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally smells like, um, like citrus
shoe polish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had a can of black Kiwi shoe
polish and it was, you poured citrus acid
[SPEAKER_00]: on those or oranges, that's what it smells
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, it's a great smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and because of that, I think I've read
that thing three or four times already,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and in my, this is just my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I would never do a filial
generation increase on somebody else's
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they've done the work and for me to
go and, and take it in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: direction than they were taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't seem right to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get a plant from somebody,
I get a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm basically only doing out crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on a rare occasion, I might go back
and do a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a plant that I really like,
but that's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, it doesn't seem right to me to take
somebody's work and go ahead and do F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in JR's case, I've bred that,
that Hawaiian, um, I think four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I'm doing is I'll send him a
hundred seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if you eat, he could, he can give
them away, throw them away, grow them,
[SPEAKER_00]: do whatever he wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, it's, it's my way of
saying thank you for, um, for letting me
[SPEAKER_00]: have that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have that cut right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really nice plant and it all
started again with that, the Panama red
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that the Panama red male did
for me was it made me focus even though
[SPEAKER_00]: it's anecdotal, cause it's a one shot
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the males that show last, you know,
we, we, we, we started the chat yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: about the male piece, which I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, honestly, I have much more fun hunting
males than females because it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: harder and you have to have a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little, but you know, it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it to me, it's intent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not the perfect male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the perfect male for the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you trying to get out of
the cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the intent on the breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have two people with the
same set of, of genetics, and one person's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for, you know, tall wispy,
you know, 16 week plant, and somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for tighter nodes, something that
they can grow inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it may take some time,
but it's likely that both of those people
[SPEAKER_00]: can find a male that will help do that
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not one perfect male to do all
the jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we mentioned DJ short real,
real briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that at least, and I don't know him,
but my understanding is he likes a male
[SPEAKER_00]: for a structure and, and doesn't add
anything so that he can keep the female
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that he likes and make a bigger,
better, a stronger plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that intent, he's looking for a
specific kind of male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I'd rather have a male
bring something to the dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm looking for the combination
that's going to increase me something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've had a number of people tell me
that that's the way they breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they want a male that allows the
female to shine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it seems like you're not really
making a cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just trying to get your female into
seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I really don't understand
that logic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So particularly when you're doing regular
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a friend that he, he does a lot
of feminized and for feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we both agree him and I
that selfing can cause problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he prefers.
[SPEAKER_03]: To use a male that has traits of vigor,
um, flower size and yield, but he wants
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's not going to give the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way, you know, if he's crossing
it to, you know, whatever, let's say
[SPEAKER_03]: runts, the progeny is going to be runts
and that it's not going to have the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene and even the high of the parent
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're doing feminized plants,
I guess I can wrap my head around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're doing a cross with
regulars, it's harder for me to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: why you would want a male that isn't
giving much besides fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, so I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, my preference is I want the males to
bring something to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, if you, so I'll do terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I test all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know where the terpenes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know with CBG, CBC, CBD, like,
especially lately when I'm doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: longer flowering stuff, I don't want any
CBD at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all it's going to do is it's,
it's going to muffle that, that nice high
[SPEAKER_00]: from the long flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I go through and, and test
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but on that, on your piece,
I agree with you that the males that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I want to bring something to the
table that I, I will say though,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like clarification from you on S1s
because I've never had a problem with self
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I've never, I've never had a
problem with any of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my guess is.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of them come out just like the mom.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess I don't understand whether
everybody's taken separate clones or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're STS in or, or reversing a plant
and taking seeds from the plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I posted on one of the forums
recently, cause guys were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: selfing and seemed like they were doing it
for the first time and they were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, the ratios right for,
you know, sodium thiosulfate and the
[SPEAKER_00]: silver nitrate to get that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think baby, an issue with some of
the fems is they're taking seeds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's being reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, then I could see an issue because now
you're stressing the plant and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking it to produce its babies at the
same time you putting it under that
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many people do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe nobody does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think that that's what most
people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you, you, you, you set up the,
you, you clone the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you, especially if you want to
keep it, you get two or three clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you grow the clone till it's,
you know, two weeks in flower a week and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half and a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's just starting to kick in and,
and the stretch is slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start STS in the other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant that's producing the female
pollen is hitting the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hitting that same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, technically it's the same
genetics, but it's physically not the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a healthy female taken
in pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a male come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had any kind of real
phenovariation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that I now, and again,
I don't have the data to say this is true,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my guess is the harder the
concentration of STS it takes to reverse a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is how stable it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some, some of me have a really,
really tough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are less likely to pass on
the Herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the hermaphroditic traits,
if you, if you used an STS solution and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, you know, you used a,
just call it, you know, five was your
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, which is a combination of the
two and you put half the solution on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant turned really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's not that strong a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also why I like these late showing
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, I, I, the Panama red
showed me what a strong male and through
[SPEAKER_00]: the progeny, it proved itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a strong male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It added strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: It added the spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did all I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get down to having four males
left, you know, I'm not picking the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's first in flower, especially
everything else is even what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: generally done over time because I feel
pretty strongly about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is I'll start with 40 plants and when I
put the males in flower, I take the first
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 20% that show sex and I just kill
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, I don't even flower them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the ones that show up at the,
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it doesn't have to be the very last
one, but I want them in the last 25%
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think those are stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's hate saying it, but the old
adage about the, you know, the buck and
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the old buck and the young buck
up at the Hill and the young book says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's run down there and get,
get some of the, get, get, get a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the old buck says, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's walk down and get them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, I think that's the way
the males are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think if they take longer,
I, they at least in my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you've tested it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've, you've done the, the ones that
flower faster and the ones that flower
[SPEAKER_03]: slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it once other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's the ones that flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no interest in at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to, let me make a comment
about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I don't believe I have as much
experience breeding as you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've been doing this for
focusing on it for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, and I hope you'll not be
offended by, you know what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: say, because it's not directed directly at
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's directed at the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea that we can select a male
based on how fast it flowers, a stem rub,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, the structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's a little bit of arrogance,
you know, and I think that the only way
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can really know what this male is
going to give you is the same way that we
[SPEAKER_03]: only know what a female is going to give
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's by growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the way I do it, you know,
particularly when I'm going to do like an
[SPEAKER_03]: F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is I try to use as many of the males as I
can separately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say, you know, I start 20 seeds
and I get 10 males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to keep those 10 males,
you know, clone them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one at a time, I'm going to flower
them with the females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you test out the seeds that are grown
with those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after you've seen, you know,
the 10 different males, what they've
[SPEAKER_03]: produced, then you can select because
we're not guessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have data, you know, and that to me is
the only way I can see doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe it's because I don't have the
skill set, but I also worry, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: my, my family heritage is Jewish,
so I guess Jewish people, they worry a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot, but I worry like what we could lose
when you do that by having that arrogance
[SPEAKER_03]: and thinking that you can visually make a
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't disagree with you because the
only real true test is the progeny,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the male producing something that's
better than something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, my average project
takes 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so yeah, I, I, I mean,
I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live and die by the sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, um, I'll give you an example of
how, how about an example of how my stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got Lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's gone out to a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an absolute great plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I bred it to a Chili Verde,
which was called Chill Lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned out to be a fabulous strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've still got one of the girls that
I'll have for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tests high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got beautiful flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really nice high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it, that breeding worked really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Lavender was a plant that worked
really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I took a Chill Lavender male,
so Chili Verde and Lavender, and went back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Lavender again to try to make it a
little more creamy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a creamy kind of floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went through and picked the
male, I was, so first of all, like I
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about, you know, last to show,
but honestly, I probably my number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, item that I'm looking at is root
growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I need to see good root mass because
then I know the plants will have vigor and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are going to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if, if I've got, you know,
five of them and two of them, the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: look like hell and the, and the other
roots are twice as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not even going to look at those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're, they're gone because of
root growth is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I got structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got different growing tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got leaf morphology, depends whether I
want to do a complimentary cross or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I want, I want to have a
conflicting cross where I'm going to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different reasons to look at
the male, but so I used my general process
[SPEAKER_00]: of root growth structure last to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bred it for the Lavender back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a bunch of people have grown it out
and the weeds real good, but somehow I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out these recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have weak branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weeds really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, you know, if you grow it in a
Scrog or a Sea Green or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, it's probably going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is the branches can't hold
the weight of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because the buds are giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just weak branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're weak branches, you know,
and, and maybe, maybe I could silica or
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium up and, and, and change the
feeding, but the reality is it doesn't
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just add something to that real
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and, you know, you have to understand
that I come from a different generation
[SPEAKER_03]: than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My generation was the chem dog generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's kind of what I'm
known for, but if the chem dog was a male,
[SPEAKER_03]: for instance, and we were using these type
of selection process, it would have been
[SPEAKER_03]: tossed because it grows like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not a strong plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, it's, it's a, it's a poor
grower with poor structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it's producing the highest
quality flower with the terpenes that we
[SPEAKER_03]: love.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I believe that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way to really know is to grow the
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, to be honest with you,
um, if the chem dog was grown,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I believe he only had like six
seeds or something when he started this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if he had a hundred seeds,
you know, that plant might've just been
[SPEAKER_03]: lost, you know, because it literally grew
so poorly and it was a difficult plant to
[SPEAKER_03]: feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I know the work is
impossible to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like it's difficult, you know,
but it's one thing to say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, you know, I'm, I'm just doing the
best I can in an impossible project.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing to say, I'm selecting
it because of this, because this is what I
[SPEAKER_03]: think makes it better because.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, you know, like the most
interesting thing that I've heard as far
[SPEAKER_03]: as selecting a male is someone told me
that, and I've never done this,
[SPEAKER_03]: that people will reverse a male to get it
to put out female flowers so that then
[SPEAKER_03]: they can rub those flowers to try to get,
um, a smell off of them, a terpene,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just a stem rub, but like of an actual
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Oh, well, you know, that's at
least giving us more information to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to go with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how valid it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so let's take the, take that
statement right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm going to look for a male,
let's say that I'm looking for a F1 male
[SPEAKER_00]: to make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already grown out a whole bunch of
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already picked the one that I like
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would tend to agree that it's
not terribly hard to pick the best female
[SPEAKER_00]: after you grow a whole bunch out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You test it, you smoke it, and it's the
one you like or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've already grown at least one,
maybe two runs of the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's an F1 and let's say the stuff
isn't crazy, you basically have three main
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 50% that are a combination of
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents and you got 25 that lean to the
mom and you got 25 that lean to the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and if the one you pick, the one,
the female that you like the best was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle, then you generally know what
the leaf morphology looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the node structure looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what that plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now go run 30 or 40 males and you're
going to have the same distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly of the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you take, if you're, if you're
breeding to the middle, then you can lop
[SPEAKER_00]: off 50% of the plants, take the ones that
lean to the mom, take the ones that lean
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dad and get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're looking at the male,
I'm still looking at root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still looking at structure,
but when I'm looking at the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, what I'm really trying to do
is I'm trying to pick a male that looks as
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the female that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I'm going to get to my F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is, it's, it's nothing's
going to be identical, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when I get F2s, even though I'm
going to get a broader range of phenos,
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the F2s, I might have literally,
you could have up to 10 different phenos,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stretching from the mom to the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you find that next one and you find
the plant that's similar to the male that
[SPEAKER_00]: you used before, which is similar to the
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can do a back cross and that gives
me something that's very, very close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the original mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I could try to pick two that are the
same, which is a little more risky,
[SPEAKER_00]: bottleneck and even father, and then
produce the F3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the intent of what you're trying
to do with the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on intent for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right that progeny
decides the male, but except for this
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender fail where I'm not having to be
happy with the structure of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the process when I'm trying
to do an out cross or, or a complimentary
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, I know kind of what I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, and I'm looking for that in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is you grow a bunch of
plants and I send them to the lab and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the turf profile is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that I want to highlight a
certain turf profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bring myrcine in,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I who knows if I'll be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want terpenaline and karyophylline and I
want myrcine way down on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not necessarily easy to do
because myrcine is all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm testing the different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the structure of the plants
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons it takes a couple
of years to do it because you're out there
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a couple of different runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the people that I, and there's plenty
of growers that are much better growers
[SPEAKER_00]: than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the people that I respect to
grow, most of them have said the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the plant dialed in on your third
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first run you find it out about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second run you're finding out really
trying to dial in the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third run is when you actually
dial in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long does it take to do three runs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just to find one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a lot and to run a hundred or
even to run 20 males and then breed them
[SPEAKER_00]: all out and figure out which is the best
by smoking the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at two or three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you live by the sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: You die by the sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some really, really nice ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, like I said, the weeds on the
lavender, it's good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unlike chem dog, it's not so special
that I'm willing to take this viney
[SPEAKER_00]: flopping over, can't hold on up the buds
plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that I would say on the
approach that I tend to use for males is I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think the plant that you're trying
to get to has to be, I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: say this, I want structure first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not taking a special plant
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then say, I'm going to breed to this
because it's a special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean I haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm doing is if I get a male and
I want to breed it to a female that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I want obsessive root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see that thing just cause the
old adage of more roots, more fruits still
[SPEAKER_00]: applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want massive root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't get the root growth,
I'm not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we don't have to bring up the
graph right now, but calf fish is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked on for the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trying to hopefully find that a
male and I had two females that literally
[SPEAKER_00]: were 50 to 75% more root mass than any of
the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing that, I just killed all the
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if I don't have a male that's
good enough to have the same root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: as one of the plants I'm selecting,
then I'm going to have to go through it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe when I go through it again,
only the females have good root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find out the next time I try to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you create the next
generation with a strong plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to me, a strong plant is root growth
mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those seeds, now if you find a special
one, it's still going to be a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take one of these other ones that
the roots aren't that strong, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of spindly, but the weeds really,
really good, you breed that, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a lot harder time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you bred a stronger male to
that series, then you're going to end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with stronger plants and you're still
going to find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather start with a strong plant
first, but will you find the next chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you find the next bag seed that turns
out to be great?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, probably not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's kind of my two cents on
the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is I've been fooling
around with pulling out recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is a lot of fun because if you
have really good quality plants and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: pull out the recessive traits,
now I'm getting something that nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the genetics are good on the plants
that I'm using, which I think they are and
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they are, then it's likely that 25%
of those plants could be special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not expecting them all to be special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I want to jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cosmic, how are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you do, I want to introduce you to
our cohost, Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosmic, how are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Boston Bob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosmic is actually the guy that helped me
record my first podcast and he's a regular
[SPEAKER_03]: cohost.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, like you, is a professional and has a
day job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's not always often able to start or
finish the podcast when they begin.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love and respect the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's always invited to be our
cohost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome Cosmic and like to introduce
you to Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, what an intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob, it's very nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice to meet you, Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on my intros, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob thanked me for his intro too and
they're both truly heartfelt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring up, we talked about the
males, we talked about the seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornbread Ricky, who is one of the two
guys at Swamp Boy Seeds, I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with him with my son seven or
eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made a really, really big
impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a kind of a different way to
think about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said there's only two kinds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds where you grow a plant and you
grow and get what's expected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or you try to find a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the two kinds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either growing or you're finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the retail market,
especially in dispensaries, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a cultivation facility, those guys get
mother plants and get 200 clones and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see the value in doing the first,
which is making seeds where if you grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you get the plant you expect,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you plant 100 seeds, 90 of them are
going to be the same kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really takes place probably around
F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're lucky, F3, but F4,
F5, F6, they're all going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are getting the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other side is do I want to buy a
seed and grow Jack Herrera, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of guys that have F8,
F9, I think they're beautiful plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole bunch of strains that
have been filial generations enough into
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds where you know what you're going
to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the people who want to
find a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the find a plant to me is much more
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the interesting part is I think a
bunch of people who buy seeds don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily know the difference between
growing and finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's less information
available when somebody's got seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're buying, selling,
growing, that they know where they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: what generation and what to expect,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people probably realize F1s,
you're going to have three main phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many people I think realize on an F2,
you could literally have 10 or 12 phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, Gabby, like you said,
if you're running a whole bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're running, that's close to open
pollination even, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that starts the whole process over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get to F3 and F4, then you
expect some kind of consistency in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who's growing for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're buying, do you know what
you're actually buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you buying to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you buying to find?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finding is much more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you find that special plant,
you clone it, you give it to your friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes to the dispensaries, they're
selling on the market versus getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: stable line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way that you may find that plant,
you probably have to use a plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: come from a stable line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if not, you get in these
polyhybrids and all the stuff is the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I found is you can work a line and
then bring in something that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: worked, let's say, F4 to F7, that's gonna
be stable, bring it into something in an
[SPEAKER_00]: outcross and then find something that
wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you can do that, but that's,
you still need both seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the grow seed and you need the
find seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how you're bringing them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring two grow seeds together,
you're gonna get something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring two find seeds together,
I think it's more polyhybrid and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, might be a good time to,
let's talk about the cap fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that one that you sent a photo of?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I pull it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well actually, yeah, go to the albino
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I gotta look for mine too,
give me one sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So albino, it depends where you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the numbers are one in 1,000 to one in
10,000, you get an albino plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 100% not variegation,
it's an albino plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I bred to bring out
recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I know I was gonna get the albino?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had absolutely no clue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I show you this other one and we
go to the chart on the cap fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there's a way to bring out
recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do me a favor, bring up the one that's
number three, it's kind of grayed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pedigree chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is, and I think,
I thought this came from Miracle 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the male that Capuleti used to
make the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I thought that is,
if we're on the number three graph now,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cap fish, so cap fish,
then the parents and go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the grandparents, both dads are fish
piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fish piss number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has been a really good strain for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna go off topic just for a
second, and for Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this particular one, Gabby on fish
piss, when I selected the male,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only did I go through my regular
process about root growth and structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually put these in flour,
pulled off all of the pollen sacs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sent it to the lab to have the
stock and the stems tested for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the variation was one and a half to
two and a half percent, with most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: around two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fish piss number four came out at
almost 2.6% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from the rough plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually how I selected this
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another one where almost
everything I've touched, like the Cecil's
[SPEAKER_00]: green and the Mac fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac fish is in at dispensaries,
but Cecil green is still out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish piss has done really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know really what to call it,
but if you look at the top line,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you go up from cap fish to Cecil's
green, and then look at the parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: fish piss and OCDM 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top line I see fish piss,
and then underneath it, OCDM 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the parents for Cecil's
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing, and literally it takes
a couple years to do this, I take the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: piss, and I breed it to OCDM 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing related in the OCDM
15.
[SPEAKER_00]: OCDM 15 to fish piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an out cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then drop down to the bottom parents
underneath that, and it's fish piss and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing, there's no relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens is, if you take this two
that are circled, OCDM 15 and Mac one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and go back up, they both have the same
father.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is M15 of Miracle 15, which is the
lone male the cap used to make these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I intentionally want the great
grandfathers of the unrelated plants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the fish piss goes in,
and it meets Mac one, it's interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: with those genetics on the bottom to make
Mac fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the fish piss goes into OCDM
15, it's making Cecil's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference is, if you look at the
genetics behind it, the dad's the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the grandfather or the great
grandfather's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is, when the alleles match
up on the genes, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-allele gene or just the two,
it's gonna probably make homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find something that didn't exist in
this previous generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you gotta go back three or four
generations to get this done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I did this, I figured I'm gonna
get some weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a complimentary breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if I did similar plants and
brought them together, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: contrasting breeding where I think I can
bring out recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually why I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you go back and you look at
the albino, the albino, which is supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be one in a thousand, is 20 to 25% of
these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally, they grow up as seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's zero chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere back in the history,
and I think we figured it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually the Miracle 15's father,
Starfighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some type of recessive traits
all the way back in that Starfighter gene
[SPEAKER_00]: that has something that shuts off
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is, that's how I get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally, it's 20 to 25%,
which according to Mendel, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you should have when you split those
phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always thought it was Miracle 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a note from Rick, who runs Mosca
Seeds, if you know Mosca, he's come out
[SPEAKER_00]: with some really, really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like him a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was telling me in his pink animal
crackers, he's had the occasional albino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the pink animal
crackers, he's got a bunch of Starfighter
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the fish piss, so I was pretty
sure it didn't come from the fish piss and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it came from the mac dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bring out recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I grow 20 seeds, and 20 to 25% of
them are albinos, I don't even have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick ones to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dead in two weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the Codledons generally
hold food for what, 10 to 14 days before
[SPEAKER_00]: you gotta feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant stays alive while the
Codledons actually are providing food to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as the Codledons run out of
food, plant's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something we're talking about was
grafting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're in fantasy land now for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was thinking about it after we
spoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grow San Pedro cactus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been many occurrence of
variegated plants and some albinos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they're found, the only way to
grow them is to graft them.
[SPEAKER_03]: To graft them to something that does have
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're talking about, could you
graft them, these albinos?
[SPEAKER_03]: To you, there was no benefit to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'm not saying I'm ready to do
the work either.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I wonder about is,
a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, could you actually graft
something so small and delicate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because cactus, they're much bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even seedlings, they have more of a
structure to graft to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a seedling, the stem is so thin and
soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you would do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I was fantasizing about was,
if you could get an albino like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: to flower and finish, the terp profile on
that would have to be super unique because
[SPEAKER_03]: it has no chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the chlorophyll has a strong
impact on the way the flower tastes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to smoke a plant or consume a plant
that had no chlorophyll, I just found it
[SPEAKER_03]: as intriguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know my thoughts,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think you can graft it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe in a lab with somebody who
is really, really good at it, maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send you 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You graft it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's Chinese proverb,
good luck, bad luck, who can tell,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's better because I'm looking
for something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you don't get something really
good without something bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's something bad, there's
likely something good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the karma thing in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant's automatically culling 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got kind of the middle phenos
and the phenos that lean towards the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my pheno variation in these is smaller,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're relatively consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some pheno variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this particular strain,
I found one plant, the number 11,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the other plants are myrcine and
karyophylline, which is kind of a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, the wheat's kind of special.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this number 11 and the ones that I
tested, the turpinoline was minuscule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number 11, the turpinoline is twice
the terpene rate of anything else in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell when it was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell halfway through in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like sweet turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really, really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I think that's the recessive
traits from that same line coming forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's coming from the
starfighter in the Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the starfighter created the
albino piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that really high
turpinoline, that the terp profile that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of that plant, I think is
coming from the Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look back, it's like five
generations back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have to grow it inside because I
grew them all outside last year or this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to grow it inside and see what the
real timing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like exactly when I go to 12-12,
find out how long it takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I can get that kind of soaring
Columbian high in a tighter structure that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow inside with a shorter flowering
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, in this one, one of the guys
that the guy who first grew these is out
[SPEAKER_00]: in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went through the ganja program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me a note that it's the most
thought-provoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about how long I've been around
for in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's honestly the most thought-provoking
weed I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happened to me twice in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't just the one-shot deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it some space and I tried it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was thinking about a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started thinking about why I
was thinking that way about thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought me to this metal level of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I've never had a buzz like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe on that, excuse me, maybe on that
Sinsemeer in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never had anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm 100% working this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of the recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to finish up on this,
the OCDM-15 was a larger stretchier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody knows what the MAC-1s like,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Little stout, little leathery leaves,
little more shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants were different,
even though they were kind of related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I brought them in with the same
male, I think this process gives me the
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk a little bit about
something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have any questions on that at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the one thing I wanted to say is,
first of all, it's a learning experience
[SPEAKER_03]: for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm appreciating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that you mentioned earlier was
how there's two different types of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds that give you what you know
you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the seeds that give you the ability to
hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is super true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that knowing what you're
looking for in that sense, and having the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to maybe get something like that,
that's what people want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that often, that's not what is
delivered.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you buy a pack of seeds, from most
seed vendors, it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't know if it's going to be
consistent or if it's going to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for instance, let's say seeds are sold
at a dispensary to a closet grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he sees the picture on the pack or on
the flyer of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wonder, is that what they're going to
get?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made me remember something I always
go back and think about was when we
[SPEAKER_03]: purchased the Super Skunk from Sensi,
I think we had a couple of packs and we
[SPEAKER_03]: started them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the uniformity was incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the point where we were able to just
make a selection and get rid of the rest
[SPEAKER_03]: of them because they were all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you worked the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hold the catalog, it was a
paper catalog from Sensi, and I would hold
[SPEAKER_03]: it up against my bud, every single crop
that I grew it, just to be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy shit, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's an amazing feeling that you're
like, I actually got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we bought the seeds in
Holland, we're like, are we getting ripped
[SPEAKER_03]: off?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get what we want out of
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And particularly with the Super Skunk,
it was exactly it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, that was when we were
more beginners at growing and when we were
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for something specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, the idea of a hunt and being able
to find something special, that is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the most rewarding thing because
you're not pulling out it's unexpected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you find that something special
through the hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, think about what you just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sensi, that consistent, just make a
general assumption, they're F4 or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got some consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the older days, especially in the
straight black market days, you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you bought seeds, they would
generally work lines because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you were humping up in the
woods and you had to do stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want all sorts of surprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a nice row.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a nice gathering of similar
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's happened is as the home
growers have come in and everybody sells
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you get all these different F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get that stuff, you got to go to
somebody who's worked the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many people really worked the
lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm doing a little bit, but it takes
a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to know the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got to believe that there were
years making those seeds that you grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get into the way they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this market, you got more of the
find-ems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you do these poly hybrids,
I don't think you find much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, and it's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be great weed, but I think you
got to bring out recessive traits from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not inventing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to create a condition in the
genetics where I'm bringing something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was already there, just hasn't been seen
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of fun to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I like that a lot, but I wonder
sometimes when people are buying,
[SPEAKER_00]: like take the catfish with the albinos,
somebody buys a pack of 10 seeds and they
[SPEAKER_00]: only plant two, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how many people actually go all
10?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for me, I do 30 or 40, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a ton of people that grow one
or two seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you bought those catfish seeds and
you grew two of them and they both turned
[SPEAKER_00]: white and died in two weeks, you're not a
happy camper, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you know in advance, it's got to
come with something on the sticker saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, 20% of these seeds are going to be
albino and will die within 15 to 20 days
[SPEAKER_03]: of them being planted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the good news is if they plant two out
of 10 seeds and they're albinos,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the other eight ones will not be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had one guy who got eight out of 10
albinos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just... And so that guy,
considering who you are, you just send
[SPEAKER_03]: them another pack of seeds or tell them,
hey, if you want to grow something else,
[SPEAKER_03]: but this is how you find something
special.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why it's work and not just come
easy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it was easy, everyone would be
doing it, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hard work pays off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me... Because it's a nice
follow-up, I think, to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you put up the pedigree chart for
number four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing that too, I wanted to kind of bring
up a point about what you guys were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about as far as consistency with
seeds too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the seed companies these
days, their catalog is constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always have new strains every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a new line coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these other companies,
especially the old school companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the same strains year after
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is kind of a good way to
show that you've been consistently working
[SPEAKER_01]: with those strains versus, oh,
I just want something new to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that or it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you hear me, Cosmic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes what these seed
companies are doing is they're just
[SPEAKER_03]: putting any seeds in the pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, for instance, if you order clone
G, for instance, so that I'm not putting
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone on blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you order, excuse me, seeds,
the seed genetic G, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've run out of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just put whatever they want in the
pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it's important to buy
genetics from reputable people that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually care about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And care about their reputation more than
they care about just making one more sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know for a fact that that's common
practice with many of these seed
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: To give you an example, people make a trip
to Holland and buy some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of these people are never coming back
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they want to have the full catalog of
seeds always.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's a lot of people that
don't have proper ethics in the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's important to know who you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Bob agrees with that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I got that chart too,
number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got the number four up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Frosty McFish, and Frosty Fish is the
dad, and MacFish6 is the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same mom as Capfish,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now this is a complimentary breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two go back to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the grandfather, he got the two fish
pisses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the third column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then underneath it is Boss Frost,
which I got from Patrick at Pico Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a California guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very nice and gave me some S3s from
this Boss Frost, which is just an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew a whole bunch of those and bred
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see on the bottom of the
same grandparents, it's fish piss with
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now Boss Frost and Mac1, they have
nothing in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not gonna get the same kind of
allele battle on the genes because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fish piss is one over Boss Frost for
allele position and the same thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I did this breeding, I assume this
is a complimentary breeding and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get much more consistent phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exactly what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants basically look very,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pheno variation is basically in
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 to 25% will be a little taller and
20 to 25% will be a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you looked at them from above and
looked at just the leaf morphology and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the nodes, they all look the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was done to try to add even more
because the fish piss added a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: potency to everything I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the fish piss prodigy came out
less than probably 24%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all 24 to 30%, all the different
prodigies I've had with fish piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this frosty fish, this is still in
dispensaries and this is a couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: old, but that's still in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, kind of validates the
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did this as a complimentary cross and
I wanted to show it so that if you looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at the other end cap fish and you look at
this one, they kind of look similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what are the differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences on the way back on the mom
side, I've got relations that I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna conflict when they finally come
together and give me those recessive
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this one, I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look on the very bottom left,
this is a note from a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this would go really well with
really good with miracle glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And miracle glue is from Cap, Capulator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is this note at?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right under the four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my notes from 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says miracle glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing is I'm always looking at
the pedigree to find out, is it
[SPEAKER_00]: complimentary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it contrasting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I gonna increase phenovariation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I gonna decrease phenovariation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why when we started talking
about the males, that also plays into what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I looking to create conflict or am I
looking to compliment the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this breeding with the
Frosted McFish, you got Boss Frost,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Gorilla Glue and Mac One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Miracle Glue is basically the
Miracle 15, which is the dad of Mac One
[SPEAKER_00]: and Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both grandmothers on this are gonna
match the plant I'm going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a project I'm doing right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already selected the Miracle Glue
female, was done in a bench with 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in an R&D room and all the
plants got PM except for this one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a picture on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't send it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan leaves are covered in trikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've never seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I actually saw that picture on your
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's this miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant's smaller, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not gonna work for the guys
in the dispensary because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get the yield from the lights
because it's a small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of picking the plant that was
more robust, I want specifically to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: Miracle Glue number four, which is very PM
resistant and was just absolutely loaded
[SPEAKER_00]: with trikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this Frosty McFish that I want to
breed into it, I literally am doing it as
[SPEAKER_00]: we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watered them this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 13 males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned before, I'm really a
big fan of root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still take my notes once a week on what
I think root growth is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the primary driver for a male
selection to breed to this Miracle Glue is
[SPEAKER_00]: PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at my tent right now,
I got 13 plants about eight nodes high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the leaves are touching every
other leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no space between the plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 13 decent sized plants filling up a
four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned the air down and I shut off all
the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in a basement of a 30 year old
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem getting PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get PM anytime I want to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far I found three plants that had PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them back in and I rotate them so
that they all eventually over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: month will all end up in a different spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a real dead spot in the tent
that one corner is always getting it or
[SPEAKER_00]: some plant in the middle is covered by
leaves, they're always getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally am rotating the plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and I'm telling you, I'm doing it as
we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I going to be successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my goal is if I'm really going to go
after this Miracle Glue, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: complimentary breeding because it's
generally the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to add in the proven plants from the
Frosty McFish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm lucky out of these 13 plants,
and it's not a huge sample, but out of
[SPEAKER_00]: these 13 plants, if I can find a couple
that don't get PM while the rest of them
[SPEAKER_00]: get PM, that's the primary motivator for
me selecting a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you said, grow them out,
check the progeny, do that stuff like we
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing root selection and morphology to
match something, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular case, I already know
the weeds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the plants are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get lucky and find something that's
PM resistant and breed it to another like
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's PM resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That should increase my odds of getting a
really nice plant that is less susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny because it reminds me of
another strain in the Sensi Seed catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to remember, I think it was the
Oasis, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it said that it was spider mite
resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we wanted to buy that strain for
breeding because this was in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really didn't have a clue about how to
deal with pests and getting a strain that
[SPEAKER_03]: spider mite resistant, that's like,
okay, got to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So powdery mildew resistant is definitely
a good quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, generally, any of the plants
that are more vigorous and healthy are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be more resistant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but these are all healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even have to create a powdery
mildew factory like you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_03]: over there to find the ones that get it
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could pretty much look at the plants
that are strongest and healthiest will
[SPEAKER_03]: generally be the most resilient against
that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go look at the page, they're all
solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intent is to breed that way for root
growth and solid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of the 13, I actually killed one
this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because in the two times I
tested, it got PM each time and it was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the weaker root plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what happens to that plant,
I would never use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of this morning, I'm down to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to go through that process,
I mean, you can find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them on a bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ghost dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I found a couple others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to doing the stuff I like
with the long flowering, I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this done because I know it's good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can create that other input where
these genes hook up together and give me
[SPEAKER_00]: some PM resistance, that's a big,
especially in New England, in the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a huge plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys might not have the same issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I wanted to do at this time,
I wanted to direct people to your
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram, which is Boston Bob Mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: No funky underscores or anything,
just Boston Bob Mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody go give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only if you're not trolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trolls stay away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trolls stay away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you go, let me finish up with
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you throw up the number two,
the picture of the plant outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing hydroponically or with
soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil only.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you keeping track of the root
growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you just popping out of the container
there and taking a peek?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't use fabric,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't pull them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you can, but I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I flip them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start my seedlings, I actually
start my seedlings in a seven ounce cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually looking at the root growth
in the first two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I track that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they go to a solo cup, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they go to one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to up part a minimum of three times,
four times if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each time, I'm not using micro
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally use recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like recharge when I dust my holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I constantly check them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I make a decision early, it's amazing,
actually, over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not always true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely not always true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you track root growth from a seven
ounce to one gallon to a two gallon to a
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallon, you'll find out that the
ones that had the strongest root growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first couple of weeks, they're the
strongest plants, like throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole cycle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my guess is that's 80 to 90% because
there's always some that come on late and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a determining factor for me,
but it's a piece of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: To him now I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant, and the reason I'm showing
is just because we've talked about cap
[SPEAKER_00]: fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mack fish number six was the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about frosty mack fish,
which is a complimentary breeding that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use to miracle group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from the 2022, 23, 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is, this is a 2022 season,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that plant's 12 feet tall and
every one of those colas is bigger than
[SPEAKER_00]: your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, those are impressive colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's seated or not seated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just grow in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but so I use coast to main soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use any foliars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the process really simple and it
gets rain or it gets watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some, I do, I do do some IPM,
but I'm not, I'm not doing anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate the growth, but this plant at
just like the Mack, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you don't get a ton of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some different variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was joking around the stuff that comes
from Mack one is gems and junk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I like cause you can, you can can
the junk early and this, and this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's some gems in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but when I talk about the breed,
the seedings and the intent and the males
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used, this is the girl I got in 22
and it takes years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to grow out a couple to find the
right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I find the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, what's going to be
complimentary?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what's going to go into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I know that all the fish piss are
going to have mercy and carry a filing in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want a complimentary, I'm going to
do something that's similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not necessarily going to hit it with
a, with a, you know, a plant that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: piney, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm not sure what that attend,
what that's going to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I take a, a mercy and carry
a filing plant or, or genetics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy in that, then I'm going to get a
complimentary and I'm, I may be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: find something even a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always looking at the plants and
figuring out how they can go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and with this one plant, I did a
complimentary, which we just showed the
[SPEAKER_00]: frosted McFish with a very uniform form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I showed the cap fish,
which has got this bizarre thinking man's
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and the, and the albinos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they both came from the same mom,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, or, or the, this mom was a key in
both of those breedings and the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really can direct the plant the way
you want it to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can try, like I said,
you're going to have some fails,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the fun part for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show this because we were
talking about all the, the moms and the
[SPEAKER_03]: other breedings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we haven't scratched the surface
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope we can make some time,
you know, like this is ultra long form
[SPEAKER_03]: over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not looking for, you know,
like before you said, Oh, I'm just going
[SPEAKER_03]: to tell you this quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want you to tell us stuff
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we want the long form story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, that just might mean that
we have to schedule part two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to ask you if you would want
to do our other show with Nick,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is called the way we grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he would love to have you on
because that one more focuses on the way
[SPEAKER_03]: you grow, you know, and we can get into
depth on, um, on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we still have a little time
and I hope you'll accept my invitation to
[SPEAKER_03]: come back, you know, as many times as it
takes till we get your story out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the same as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start, you start talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could talk about it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we probably don't have time to even
get into it, but, um, I still wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask it just so you can start thinking
about it, Bob, um, for the Mac one I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard, um, and I don't know if I'm
pronouncing this correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it's, that's what happens
when you read things, you don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: speak about it, but I've heard that it's a
triploid, uh, which means that it has like
[SPEAKER_01]: a third chromosome and it's one of the
unique traits of the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, another thing about that is it
makes it really hard to breed with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, for some reason, it leaves you with a
lot of immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is just something I've
read about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that you've actually worked
with this plant, uh, it's very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: to me to hear, you know, from your
experience firsthand, um, about how that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant reacts to, you know, breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mac one, I've seen the triploid
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pay a ton of attention to it
because I know what the plant does and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know what it can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, the plant itself is important,
but not off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't know that I've ever got more
than 70 seeds off of a Mac one and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's generally in the 25 to 50 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they give you the, and it's kind
of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, we just finished talking about
that frosty Mcfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, nobody really tells you what they
get for seeds because everybody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy seeds that they can, that nobody else
can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't talk about the different
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That frosty Mcfish in a four by four tent
and a four foot plant gave me 9,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm growing them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all German.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all solid 9,000 seeds that,
that same size plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a Mac one would be 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the reasons why you don't
see a lot of breeding in with the Mac one,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's more work and you're not
going to get a ton of stuff like that Mac
[SPEAKER_00]: fish six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most of the ones I've seen,
once I have, I have Mac, I did a Mac red,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never, I never released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's around here, but it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got, you know, enough seeds
to maybe go and find one more plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we grew them over three years and you
end up basically with the Macs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with one plant because you
just, you don't have that many to search
[SPEAKER_00]: through, but yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a very tough plant to get seeds
out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even get dead seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that a trait that you've noticed
it's passed along to the offspring that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, cause I used the Mac fish,
um, gave me a ton of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the frosty Mac fish is the plant
that gave me 9,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the Mac's a nice strong
plant and it, and it adds a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the thing is you, if you bring
flavor into it, and I, I tried to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: the spice into it and the, the fish fish
brings this kind of umami flavor in,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you bring flavor in like talking to
Gabby before about, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the male bringing structure and stuff like
that without bringing something to the
[SPEAKER_00]: party would not be a great idea for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was the Mac one, I think you bring
something into the Mac one, you get
[SPEAKER_00]: something better out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get see, honestly,
when you get stuff, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some junk, like they're going to be
squirrely and everybody wants to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: save that squirrely plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it could be the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I've never found any success dealing
with the squirrely plants coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a couple and, and from,
you know, now it's, I know which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, well, I think I know which ones
are going to turn out better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll focus on them, but yeah,
it's a, it's an interesting breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, same, I would never filial
generation it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did my breedings with it and I passed
it on to a couple of people as it was
[SPEAKER_00]: passed to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't had the Mac one in a couple
of years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we only have a couple of minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we go, I wanted to see if there
was anything you wanted to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already discussed that you'll be
back soon for part two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully be doing the way we grow
podcast, but is there anything you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: say before we go today?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, um, that's why I sent you the text.
[SPEAKER_00]: I w I've watched a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched with Marcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched with, you know, George Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's, it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and honestly, if you look at your
subscribers relative to your, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reviews people are watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice high percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you've got a good group of people
who are interested in the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always a good place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can only watch the,
the Australian podcast and we can only
[SPEAKER_00]: watch FCP and we can only watch a couple
of these so much and you're out of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you know, you have the ability and
potential to bring new material and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and you like the story format.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I congrats to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, like I said, I, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The love that we're getting on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unexpected and so, so appreciated,
you know, like, I don't think there's
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone that couldn't use more positivity
in their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been great, you know,
like every day I send the cosmic and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, wolf a message saying, look at,
look at these comments and look at how
[SPEAKER_03]: many more views these last videos gotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people ask, like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's totally organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we don't, we don't promote
it any, you know, at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've just had, we've been lucky to
have really interesting guests join us
[SPEAKER_03]: right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been lucky that somehow,
I mean, can I ask how did you find our
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm not sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like when I look at actually,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mark, Mark Gallo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we interviewed Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mark posted that he was coming on
and then I'm like, Oh, and then I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, so, you know, this couple
thousand people to follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, and, and that's
probably a good chunk right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, we did the video with Kevin
Jodri and he's just like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's probably doing a search for his
name and Kevin's got a pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like I said, we've been lucky to
have good guests and you're definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: included in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, uh, and, and I think the
proof is in our text message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agreed to have you on the podcast before
I knew anything about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started talking to you and I
was like, Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and with a great story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, what I like,
if, if I'm giving away plants and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: gets better at breeding and someday I may
use that plant to cross something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want it with the same parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more people I can help,
the better the genetics are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a benefit for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I truly enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, earlier in the podcast,
you said you're doing this because of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, your ego, but I don't really
think that that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that a bigger part of it
is how much you love the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's cool that it feeds your ego
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like I said, when people,
um, thank me for doing the podcast and
[SPEAKER_03]: tell me how much they love me,
it's feeding my ego a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I am still doing it because in the end
I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love having these conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can be both.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feed your ego and you can love the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's clear that you love the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We even spoke, um, about yesterday,
how, if you had to choose to stop smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: or stop growing, you would choose to stop
smoking because you just, you just love
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, honestly it's, it's OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is OCD kicks in and it just
happened that when it kicked in and we 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, it kind of never went away and
it's become primary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did Greyhounds for a bunch of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I r- I drag race motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Greyhounds, did you breed them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like becoming a very common thread
that all of the great Breeders that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm meeting that they bred dogs as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I get all the stud books I used to
study horse breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean half of the thoroughbreds of the
world come from like five horses right in
[SPEAKER_00]: five Arabian so You know, I the breeding
is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the genetics Well, we really loved
talking to you and I'm gonna call you back
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately after the New Year and try to
like Fit you in right away because like I
[SPEAKER_03]: said, I really want to release I Don't
want to I don't want people to feel like
