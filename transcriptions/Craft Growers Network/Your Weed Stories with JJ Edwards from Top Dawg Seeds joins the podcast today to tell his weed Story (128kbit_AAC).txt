[SPEAKER_05]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Gabby Staten Island on the Craft
Growers Network and of course we're joined
[SPEAKER_05]: by my co-hosts Cosmic and Sasha the
Slovenian Hobbit and today our guest is JJ
[SPEAKER_05]: Edwards from Top Dog Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done a few episodes regarding the
sour including with Klopp and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely something that was high on my
list is to have a conversation with JJ
[SPEAKER_05]: because he was extremely relevant to the
sour story as a matter of fact far more
[SPEAKER_05]: relevant than I am you know people
generally or regularly say hey Gabby I
[SPEAKER_05]: want to thank you for your involvement in
the sour and I tell them I really had
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing to do with it I mean I was living
on the west coast and you know we got the
[SPEAKER_05]: sour cuts out here and you know I've grown
a lot of sour more sour than most people I
[SPEAKER_05]: think but JJ was in the heart of the sour
scene in New York he used to do business
[SPEAKER_05]: with Klopp and so really nice to have you
finally JJ and tell us your weed story.
[SPEAKER_01]: No I appreciate it and I don't deserve all
those accolades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say you were cool or anything I
just said you were relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to be you know in the
right place at the right time and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and really a lot of those accolades go to
some of the other people that that created
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour diesel like you know Klopp was
part of it and you know AJ had a big part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the you know the distribution and
getting the popularity out there so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I was just one of those people that
were kind of along along for the ride but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know just I guess you know starting
from you know the beginning you know I you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I started first I first smoked weed
when I was 13 and I think that was like in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1979 and it was I think it was like it was
a snowy Christmas day actually and we used
[SPEAKER_01]: to go out shoveling snow to make money and
me and my neighbor and so we you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: snowed we you know got our shovels we went
out we were going to shovel some driveways
[SPEAKER_01]: and sidewalks and he pulled out a joint
you know he had some older brothers and I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess he had gotten a joint from them and
you know we were in the woods and we
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked it and that was basically you know
my first experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was probably in seventh grade at the
time and so you know you know growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: in middle school I probably you know had a
couple more experiences with weed but it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't really a regular thing for me until
I hit high school and you know when we hit
[SPEAKER_01]: high school you know it was kind of turned
into an everyday thing there was people
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking there were people selling loose
joints for a dollar back then if you could
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that you know people used to just
take a marlboro box filled up with joints
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it you know into you know the school
in the beginning of school and you would
[SPEAKER_01]: be able you know we had a smoking section
on grounds and so everyone would smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: their cigarettes and we smoked our weed
there too so that's where you know pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much going up through high school I um you
know when you're when you're smoking and
[SPEAKER_01]: buying weed you're actually starting to
sell it to your friends and stuff so like
[SPEAKER_01]: unknowingly you kind of just start into
the business if you're buying it and your
[SPEAKER_01]: friend is like oh sell me something a five
or ten dollars worth or you know and then
[SPEAKER_01]: before you know it you're kind of wheeling
and dealing a little bit making trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make free weed basically back then you
know and so you know it was really my
[SPEAKER_01]: first experience is really you know
getting coming up through high school you
[SPEAKER_01]: know experiencing kind of the the late 70s
you know early 80s well I would I would
[SPEAKER_01]: describe the late 70s as kind of the
cheech and chong era and it kind of was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the Panama Reds you know the apple
poker gold the Colombian golds and you
[SPEAKER_01]: were getting that as a kid um I know I had
gotten the Colombian gold one time and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was this really bright gold kind of
sativa-y um it was kind of grassy the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that it looked almost you know but it
wasn't really loose but it was it was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of loose but not super loose but you know
and my friend's brother who was older you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we had split um we split an ounce and
we got half ounce each of it and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time it wasn't he didn't say it was
gold or anything like that but we were I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like man I've never seen weed like
this before and then you know looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of the real stuff you know I
recognized it right away and uh so I was
[SPEAKER_01]: really too young to really like remember I
was it was probably more sativa up
[SPEAKER_01]: upity-high I don't remember it really
being that devastating or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that but I was probably too young to
really um recognize the the effects and
[SPEAKER_01]: the specialness of it you know and so we
used to get some good tie back then uh the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian but really you know leading up
until you know I would say 81 82
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was strictly import so we would
always just see the Mexicans and uh and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Colombians and Jamaicans basically you
know and the ties would you know rarely
[SPEAKER_01]: come in but uh but then there was you know
the that's when the real sensei bud came
[SPEAKER_01]: out and we called it the Christmas tree
bud and it was just the the green sensei
[SPEAKER_01]: bud that came out of Cali I guess it was
pretty much uh outdoor light depth looking
[SPEAKER_01]: back at it um you know had a little bit of
a sativa twist to it very piny and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was pretty much like the first
kind of kind bud if you want to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: that uh that I experienced uh other than
the Hawaiian the Hawaiian bud would come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and I remember that well both both of
both of them were back then was 200 bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: an ounce and so we're talking early 80s
and um compared to like you can get an
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce of Mexican or so for 40 bucks or 30
bucks so that was you know it was quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: big difference in uh in in price so um
yeah that was really kind of my first
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in in in the in the kind bud
and you know and as you know um you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: graduated high school and such and so
people started going into um into New York
[SPEAKER_01]: City and in in scoring weed and so that's
you know I started you know a friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine introduced me to someone he had
hooked up with and you know I got an in
[SPEAKER_01]: right away and uh so we would be able to
go there and get 1200 pounds uh 1200
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar pounds of uh pretty much really
good green Mexi mids that were kind of um
[SPEAKER_01]: we call them the you know the pillows
because they would you know you would be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to break one up and fill up a whole
gallon baggie and so that would be your
[SPEAKER_01]: pillow pretty much and so we would we
would you know get those and um bring them
[SPEAKER_01]: back to Jersey and so uh that was really
my first you know then I was able to tap
[SPEAKER_01]: into the to the local scene of the exotics
of the stuff that they were bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: and um so I was able to see a lot of
different stuff you know in the mid mid to
[SPEAKER_01]: late 80s or yeah because I pretty much
probably started going in the city around
[SPEAKER_01]: 85 and so from 85 going onwards you know I
was just had a you know a plug in the city
[SPEAKER_01]: he had an apartment and you just go up and
cherry pick what you wanted what he had
[SPEAKER_01]: for sale and then I wound up I wound up in
the park in 1991 sheeps meadow but we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually it was 92 I first went up there
in 91 I scoped out the scene and I seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: was an open-air drug market kind of like
you know the same thing that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing in in San Francisco in Golden Gate
Park and there was a connection between
[SPEAKER_01]: sheep meadow and Golden Gate Park because
a lot of the hippies that they would just
[SPEAKER_01]: travel back and forth you know to both
places and you know you know people would
[SPEAKER_01]: mention to me Golden Gate Park that's
where you go and you'd be able to buy acid
[SPEAKER_01]: and buy weed and mushrooms and
psychedelics and it was the same scene in
[SPEAKER_01]: sheeps meadow you know when I first went
in there and so when I went sheeps meadow
[SPEAKER_05]: was a really cool yeah you know like
particularly in when the weather was nice
[SPEAKER_05]: sheeps meadow was just like a magical
place where not you know because you know
[SPEAKER_05]: the Golden Gate Park over by the Hay to
Ashbury it was really kind of a seedy
[SPEAKER_05]: scene you know it was it was dark it was
that well sheeps meadow was dark too if
[SPEAKER_05]: you I mean what I was gonna say is in the
summertime even in sheeps meadow would be
[SPEAKER_01]: really there'd be families there too but
in the midst of all that someone would
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out a gun or I saw it firsthand you
know what I mean I got robbed there too
[SPEAKER_05]: but it wasn't in the summertime no I was
more like you know later in the season
[SPEAKER_01]: actually as it got more packed it got more
dangerous because it was hard to see like
[SPEAKER_01]: what was going on at the time you know I
saw some kid trying to well I watched a
[SPEAKER_01]: scammer he used to he used to sell fake
hits and the guy was kind of big he had
[SPEAKER_01]: just gotten out of jail months beforehand
and I was aware who he was and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to you know there's like this young
like 17 year old high school kid was
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to buy some hits from him and they
were fake and the kid was looking at him
[SPEAKER_01]: and then he was like unsure and then he
had the money in his hand and then
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually the fucking dude just fucking
yoked him around to fucking try choking
[SPEAKER_01]: him out and grabbing his money and this
was like just in the same environment as
[SPEAKER_01]: you described families kids like it was
just crazy back then so like you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: was you know even though you know there
would be people like JFK jr. up there all
[SPEAKER_01]: types of actors celebrities you know it
was a really it was really a really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: scene back then but you know as I you know
before the before that you know I you know
[SPEAKER_01]: so I first got in there in 91 I started
you know I saw the scene I prepared myself
[SPEAKER_01]: for you know during the winter because
during the winter that's when all the good
[SPEAKER_01]: weed would come in so like some of these
really good like high-end Maxis came in
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were like you know it's kind of
like the pretendica weed back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: if you remember the pretendica you know
and that was like really good Maxi and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like maybe a few seeds in there so if
you were really slick you were able to pop
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds out and present it almost as
kind bud so you know I had gotten some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and I that was the first fake right
right so I you know I saw this you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the potential of this so I was just gonna
bag up ace and just sell it straight up
[SPEAKER_01]: you know so you know I got a good price on
it and and that's what I did I hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: park and I just started selling you know
ace of that Maxi out there and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really have any I didn't really have any
really straight kind bud connections or
[SPEAKER_01]: grower connections back then like I had my
main plug and he would get exotics here
[SPEAKER_01]: and there and whatever so but I didn't
really have my main connection and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you know one day that all changed
you know I met I met my clap out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: the weasel the weasel yeah so I mean when
I met Mike he had the skunk one two and
[SPEAKER_01]: three so that was the RFK one two and
three so you know proceeding you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when you guys you know kind of you
know did you know your whole thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the RFK and you know how he
inspired you to grow and then you inspired
[SPEAKER_01]: him to grow and then eventually Mike
inspired me to grow so it was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of real you know full circle
kind of a thing and it didn't start off
[SPEAKER_01]: like that but you know but when I first
met Mike you know and I and he was he was
[SPEAKER_01]: just selling the you know RFK one two and
three so you know I was just you know he
[SPEAKER_01]: was a grower and I was just like listen
dude I'll take everything you got because
[SPEAKER_01]: he had he had everything broken down in
the quarters and he's like oh well I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna try sell all of them I say listen
how much do you want for him and I'll take
[SPEAKER_01]: them all boom you know and then and you
know so I just wanted to lock him in and
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually I did you know and you know the
business you know he started getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit bigger then he was like hey
listen you know maybe we shouldn't meet in
[SPEAKER_01]: a park anymore we should go down to
wetlands he's like you go down to wetlands
[SPEAKER_01]: on Tuesday it's Grateful Dead night you
know they have a drum circle and stuff you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you could smoke weed blah blah blah
and so we went down there and it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it was really cool down there and
so yeah downstairs in the wetlands where
[SPEAKER_01]: they had all the pillows yes yes well they
had a Greenpeace meeting in you know
[SPEAKER_01]: before that so as soon as a Greenpeace
meeting wrapped up you know everyone would
[SPEAKER_01]: be just sitting there hanging out with you
know you know a guitar some bongos a
[SPEAKER_01]: tambourine whatever little instrument you
had you know and so you know once the
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenpeace meeting wrapped up then
everyone would just start you know start
[SPEAKER_01]: jamming a little bigger and the scene
going they would start playing some you
[SPEAKER_01]: know dead music you know some nights he
had a cover band you know so it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: really really cool scene back then and so
you know we you know that's how we kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: first met AJ and so like you know somehow
or another he just kind of sniffed us out
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was just me meeting me meeting
Mike down there you know and so you know
[SPEAKER_01]: we would do the deal and you know then we
would be able to spark up and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: relax and you know what I mean and so
that's when we first met AJ and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: he sniffed out you know the you know the I
think by then we might he might have
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten the the chem the the chem dog by
then and so that's you know yeah pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much that we you know he had the chem 91
back then you mean the weasel right not AJ
[SPEAKER_01]: no not AJ the weasel had it and so you
know he sniffed he sniffed out the 91 that
[SPEAKER_01]: me and him were smoking and then he just
kind of like hey you know if you want we
[SPEAKER_01]: can go into the back office because he was
an intern for the Greenpeace meeting and
[SPEAKER_01]: also for you know the bar and stuff so you
know he had a back office so we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to go right into the back office you
know and have like four or six people
[SPEAKER_01]: there break out all of our weed just kind
of start throwing down smoking selling
[SPEAKER_01]: this and that and yeah that's how that
whole thing really kind of first started
[SPEAKER_01]: and and that's when you know AJ kind of
when diesel first got coined because he'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be like yo you guys got any of that diesel
you know meaning the 91 but meaning like
[SPEAKER_01]: back then diesel was kind of a just a
catch name for stuff that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: strong you know so like a lot of things
were diesel back then so it wasn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: weed so that's kind of where the first
coal diesel and then you know you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember smoking a J with someone down
there and I and I passed it to him and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's smoking on it he's like he's like is
this organic and I'm like I'm like no I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think you know at the time I wasn't
growing you know I didn't know I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: no I don't think so you know he goes
what's the name of this stuff I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's called chem dog he's like chem chem
he's grown with chemicals this and that
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's just like you know because of the
smell and everything then he just started
[SPEAKER_01]: going off on his tangent so then after
that I was like oh wow maybe we should
[SPEAKER_01]: just start you know get rid of the get rid
of the chem and just kind of call it
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel or you know so that's kind of kind
of the direction it kind of went in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning with the 91 was kind of I had a
similar I had a similar feeling and story
[SPEAKER_05]: myself I don't know if you've heard it on
my podcast but when I got the chem dog
[SPEAKER_05]: from Greg I was an organic grower and I
was like I'm not gonna call this shit the
[SPEAKER_05]: chem dog like I'm growing it organic so I
just used to call it the dog you know
[SPEAKER_05]: because for me at that point I was
offended by the idea of growing with
[SPEAKER_05]: mineral salts which you know I've come a
long way since then but yeah I just called
[SPEAKER_05]: it the dog not the chem dog yeah and back
then it wasn't called the 91 you know
[SPEAKER_05]: there was it was just the chem dog yeah
but there back then there was like this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole kind of hippy-dippy kind of organic
kind of thing going on back then and no
[SPEAKER_01]: one really had the really the real
knowledge behind all of it especially back
[SPEAKER_01]: then everyone was just kind of trying to
work with guanos and others kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and so you know that's the stuff
this really turned into a nightmare in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end so it was just so much work and you
know it was still really hard to pull off
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know especially if you're growing
for production so you know you just got to
[SPEAKER_01]: really start making some decisions on
really what you're doing but back then
[SPEAKER_01]: none of that was ever really none of that
was really thought of you know it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: a matter of you know a lot of people just
had you know grows in their in their in
[SPEAKER_01]: their closet or their bedrooms or you know
one or two lights and you know that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really how it started you know people
didn't start out with these big elaborate
[SPEAKER_01]: you know five or ten light grows they were
you know happy just to pull one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: lights off because we didn't know what the
fuck we were doing back then you know it
[SPEAKER_05]: was really and also we're getting such a
high price that with two lights we were
[SPEAKER_05]: making a great right right you're right
about it's funny when you think about
[SPEAKER_05]: saying you know two to five lights as an
elaborate grow you know but back then it
[SPEAKER_05]: was yeah if you had five lights back then
you were just crushing right but you were
[SPEAKER_01]: making so much yeah but if you're getting
you know four or five hundred an ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: straight up like and you can't grow enough
of it like you know and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like how it was because really there
weren't really that many people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: really growing back then and growing you
know the super fire stuff you know on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of it you know so that you know there were
people were growing but you know when
[SPEAKER_01]: people smelled the chem dog when they
smelled the sour diesel you know it was
[SPEAKER_01]: something like they've never seen before
and people just started going crazy for it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know and just you know touching on
you know the sour you know it was really
[SPEAKER_01]: you know AJ that really kind of you know
got that popular rise down in the city and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know at the time I was just kind of
you know selling weed and I was you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: was close to the sources of you know of
clap who you know where those seeds first
[SPEAKER_01]: started off that and you know but even
before that Mike had made the underdog
[SPEAKER_01]: which I don't know if you ever remember
the underdog and it was 91 times the well
[SPEAKER_01]: he's told me two different stories on it
originally when I first remember him
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me he told me it was nl super
skunk times the 91 now he says it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: the nl times the 91 but after after you
know I did after growing it and smoking it
[SPEAKER_01]: like there was definitely some skunk in
there because nl's are kind of bland ish
[SPEAKER_01]: and in 91 could kind of you can kind of
say the same thing about it other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheminess to it you know there is no real
funk you know like skunk skunkiness sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of speak to it you know kind of like I
would say the Chem D is more skunkier than
[SPEAKER_01]: the 91 so the 91 I think is more like yeah
and and really you know and it's funny
[SPEAKER_01]: that you say that because I think the same
thing and and if you think about it now if
[SPEAKER_01]: the story that's true about the og being
now the guy that tells the story says it
[SPEAKER_01]: was what did he say it was it was Hindu
Kush times the em or the emerald triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: which we don't know what the emerald
triangle was but we do know the Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had gotten at the time from
Neville well that was nl two times Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: number four and I've also I've grown out
the nl2 recently from Todd McCormick and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can tell you when you look on the growth
that of the nl2 compared to the to the 91
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Kush it's they're pretty much the
same you know the the turf profiles are a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit different but the the popcorn
style nugs and the way that it stretches
[SPEAKER_01]: out and everything you know and even
Neville himself when he first saw the og
[SPEAKER_01]: he said he's like yeah that's my nl2 is in
there so he recognized it so you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a you know it might be you know a
different type of mixture but I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: nl2 is probably in both the the Kush and
in the 91 and from my experience from what
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown out you know so you know it's
it's funny that that you mention that I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean to me it's obvious when when you
taste and you know most people I could say
[SPEAKER_05]: even today most people have zero
experience smoking the chem dog you know
[SPEAKER_05]: the 91 but when I smoke any og or the chem
dog it's it's like their sisters right you
[SPEAKER_01]: can definitely you can definitely yeah but
you know but then you know we don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what the the emerald triangle was you know
so that definitely had some kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: gassiness it seems like whatever but to me
the question is where does that where's
[SPEAKER_01]: that chem come from where does that chem
funk come from and so that's you know to
[SPEAKER_01]: me I think it's got to be some type of
Afghan or Hindu Kush or something along
[SPEAKER_01]: those lines because you just don't really
get that fueliness really out of any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like Mexican sativa or anything like
that that's other that has been suggested
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past you know so you know that
that's the you know that's the question is
[SPEAKER_01]: where does that like you know even with
the the Chem D you get that garlic oniony
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing going on and you know and
then originally you know you had the the
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 and the sister you remember the sister
and the sister was kind of like the sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: version of the Chem D like they both
smelled exactly the same but grew totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different and the effects were totally
different you know where the sister was
[SPEAKER_01]: more of that sativa kind of more stretchy
more kind of uplifting kind of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: but it still kind of had that garlic
oniony kind of profile that the Chem D has
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Chem D is more of more indiga more
you know heavy-hitting type of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and so even in you know you know
there's there's lots of hybrid sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: indiga hybrids even in Afghanistan and
Pakistan you know as you get up north more
[SPEAKER_01]: as you're getting towards the Indian
borders in Nepal and all that you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting into I think a little bit
more sativa type of plants that could
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly you know especially on the more
going towards India I would say that would
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you know display some of these you
know traits but you know all that is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of speculation on my part and you know I
don't have any real proof to really you
[SPEAKER_01]: know behind any of that but you know at
this point we only kind of have that to go
[SPEAKER_01]: on is what we know and what the history of
certain things are in certain regions and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and unfortunately a lot of that's
been lost because of wars and and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that so you know there isn't like you
know any of us could really go on go on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground over there and try to do any
kind of research or whatever but even what
[SPEAKER_01]: what Kevin Jodry did was you know you got
to have a set of balls to really you know
[SPEAKER_01]: go over there you know at that point your
life is in these other people's hands you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know I wouldn't feel safe unless
I had an armed security guard with me at
[SPEAKER_01]: all times because just the appearance of
you could just you know make someone want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do something possibly so you know I tip
my hat for for to him to you know for
[SPEAKER_05]: having the balls to do that yeah I agree I
would say you would need more than one
[SPEAKER_05]: armed guard well I would want more than
one armed guard because what's one guy
[SPEAKER_05]: with a gun gonna do against right ten
people yeah so but one question I want to
[SPEAKER_05]: ask since you've got the Dancing Bears
behind you when did you get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful Dead my first show was spring of
87 at the Brendan Byrne arena opening song
[SPEAKER_05]: was dancing in the streets nice and you
got the Dancing Bears behind you my first
[SPEAKER_05]: show was at the same location but in 1988
Brendan Byrne 330 88 and the reason why I
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to ask was because well first of
all because I'm a deadhead but second of
[SPEAKER_05]: all was you didn't find kind bud at the
Grateful Dead shows and weren't able to
[SPEAKER_05]: make any connections for for nice weed
there you had to wait you know because
[SPEAKER_05]: you're saying you weren't getting any of
that till you know 91 well I was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: it I was getting it some from my plug you
know in the city you know but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like I was directly you know connected to
the grow or anything and in here when I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to go into the shows everyone would
go shopping park you know in the parking
[SPEAKER_01]: lot on Shakedown Street and everything but
I never you know when I went to the shows
[SPEAKER_01]: it really wasn't my focus to do business
really it was really my focus was more to
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy myself let my guard down and you
know have a good time and everything so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know when you're high on mushrooms and
acid sometimes it's hard to navigate you
[SPEAKER_01]: know doing things so yeah you know so I
never really made any really major
[SPEAKER_01]: connections on tour or anything like that
I wouldn't you know I wasn't really a tour
[SPEAKER_01]: head I mean I would go to most local shows
you know I would you know go out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: East Coast or you know we would you know
plan a trip here or there but no I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: someone that went on tour on every show or
whatever and so you know I stayed within
[SPEAKER_01]: my means and my bounds and you know at
that time you know I was really just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get my shit together and you
know and figure out life you know because
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you know you're trying to you
know think about doing a career and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're hustling on the side and so you see
how much money is kind of being made and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's a hard decision you know and
you know I went the route of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: going into a trade school and learning you
know a craft in the Union and you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to have some kind of legitimate
skills to be able to survive on other than
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of hustling and you know dedicating
my life full-time to hustling and selling
[SPEAKER_01]: weed you know and kind of looking back now
how things have kind of shaken out and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know some of those people now that kind of
went the route of just doing the hustle
[SPEAKER_01]: now they find themselves in a spot now
because of legalization and things aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they used to be used to and now
they don't have no job skills to survive
[SPEAKER_01]: on on it on the outside now you find
yourself 60 65 years old with no job
[SPEAKER_01]: skills you got minimal money you might you
know own a house or have some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: equity behind you but you know trying to
you know trying to make money you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: that type of you know in today's you know
times and everything it's it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: tough you know back in the day it was easy
for anyone to pick up a job the only thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you had to do is pick up a newspaper
looking to want ads you know that doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: exist anymore you know like and back in
the day in New York City you could be a
[SPEAKER_05]: terrible grower and still make good money
yeah you know like you could grow shitty
[SPEAKER_05]: weed get a shitty yield sell it wet and
still be and still be and still be rushing
[SPEAKER_05]: nowadays you can be growing really good
weed and still struggle selling it and and
[SPEAKER_05]: struggle selling it for a price where you
could actually even just pay the bills to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it well now I think you know you know
it's really it's all about the retail now
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you if you're growing you know if
you got your home grow and you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to have your own customers basically
you know there's no more wholesale so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no more you know so all the people
that you're selling to are all consuming
[SPEAKER_01]: it you know maybe you might get a few
people that you know might take something
[SPEAKER_01]: but like for the for the prices like and
you know and and as a as a grower as a
[SPEAKER_01]: craft grower what is the bottom you know I
mean what's the bottom what's what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom per pound that you're willing to go
so here you know I don't think we found
[SPEAKER_01]: that yeah you know to me I mean anywhere
there's it ranges it could be 24 to $3,000
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and it really all depends on how
good of a grower you are how good your
[SPEAKER_01]: product is and and where you're willing to
stand you know and if you're like listen
[SPEAKER_01]: my my my units are 3g straight up you know
and if you're only producing X amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: product and you're able to sell it before
the next before the next crop that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's well that's what you know so it's
better to have a demand than have an
[SPEAKER_01]: oversaturation and I think and that's
where I think you know the the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercialized legal market and has made
them just the mistake because they've made
[SPEAKER_01]: these massive grows you know that costs a
lot of money to you know to keep up just
[SPEAKER_01]: in payroll and just monthly expenses and
just as you explained like all right so
[SPEAKER_01]: you got it doesn't matter how many square
feet you have if you ain't selling all
[SPEAKER_01]: that weed before your next crop then it's
just a race to the bottom you know I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: so to me I think it's been better to be
micro being small craft producing a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product that's going to sell out
and be in demand and then then you could
[SPEAKER_01]: build your business model off of that if
you want to upscale off of that but
[SPEAKER_01]: starting off off of these big upscale
projects just don't work this doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of them fell yes and
otherwise well the majority of our back
[SPEAKER_01]: door and pounds out the fucking back and
that's the only way they are survived
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone not the majority every story
anyone that tells you that they're not
[SPEAKER_05]: back during the weed is just you know
trying to protect their privacy and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and so to me you know if you if you
can do this craft thing and then and go
[SPEAKER_01]: right from you know farmer to consumer
like that's the best business model that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is there's no middleman it's from
from the seed to sale small small craft
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer market higher quality higher
profits you know you know per per unit
[SPEAKER_01]: should we say now overall sales per year
yeah you may be limited but listen if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just you know you know one or two
people you know how many how much money do
[SPEAKER_01]: you need every you know you know I'm
saying like you just got to be happy for
[SPEAKER_01]: what you for what you get and just be
thankful you do something that you love
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting paid for you know like I like
to make it the analogy of comparing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: being in music where you don't have to be
a superstar you could be a music teacher
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you can make a living off of
teaching people how to play guitar or
[SPEAKER_01]: piano and you're doing something that you
love and you're getting paid for it like
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a win for me yeah it's also a hard
life I I've done that I had my own
[SPEAKER_03]: teaching company I was gonna say though
you know with those commercial growers one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the other things that they've done is
they've essentially flooded the market and
[SPEAKER_03]: they've lowered prices significantly you
know I'm here in Southern California and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I'm luckily in a position where I
have a career I don't you know I I do my
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding stuff for fun I don't have to
rely on anything you know to help pay the
[SPEAKER_03]: bills but from what I understand you know
pounds out here even for high quality
[SPEAKER_03]: product it's like 1800 you know two grand
you know for a pound and that's for the
[SPEAKER_03]: best quality product exactly exactly and
and that's hard to get I mean most people
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just they don't really care too
much you know they can go to the local
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary and get ounces for what 60 70
80 bucks you know and in their mind that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what the price is now it doesn't matter if
it's craft or if it's commercial you know
[SPEAKER_05]: the average person at least so I remember
I remember it was the early 2000s or yes
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere in the 2000s when Sunday ungrown
in California was dropping below a
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand dollars a pound and everyone
thought that that was the end they
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't believe that they couldn't get a
thousand dollars a pound for their outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: weed and today that same weed is a couple
hundred bucks you know like you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: really really nice outdoor weed not
greenhouse for 300 bucks 200 bucks and
[SPEAKER_05]: like the best greenhouse weed maybe not
like light assisted but just greenhouse
[SPEAKER_05]: weed if you can get four or five hundred
dollars for that you're absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: crushing you know and and I remember some
old-time growers that thought you know
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand dollars a pound anything less
than that was just how do you survive and
[SPEAKER_05]: also think about it that was a thousand
dollars a pound 20 plus years ago so with
[SPEAKER_05]: the value of money having changed you know
it's it's become very difficult to make a
[SPEAKER_05]: living growing weed these days is the
reality and also I think it's not knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: who your customers are and and trying to
market yourself towards them because right
[SPEAKER_01]: now you know the market is just flooded
with mids you know just flooded you know
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know as just as cosmic was saying
like most people you know weed is weed all
[SPEAKER_01]: right so to to people like us weed this
isn't weed so you know you know so when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in the mids game like you're not
really particularly you know trying to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know overdo things for people as as in
promotions and stuff it is it is what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is where where you know where you're
trying to do a more higher connoisseur
[SPEAKER_01]: clientele then you know you got to get
people's attention you know it's like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and so you know and really you know
it comes down to the product speaking for
[SPEAKER_01]: itself you know when something is that
good and and it's shown around and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets recognized you know then it becomes
it becomes its own thing you know so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't really you know you can't really
make that up the only thing you could do
[SPEAKER_01]: is you put something in the market and you
know the market determines kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what it is and so now when you're
dealing with a higher connoisseur type of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are weed nerds essentially
that know everything about weed you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you know so that you know those gonna be
the you're more craft kind of customer you
[SPEAKER_01]: know where you know they come in they're
gonna want to know you know what's behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the lineage of this and that and you know
you know you know when you're talking to a
[SPEAKER_01]: bud tendered and they tell you well it's a
sativa that's all I know it's a sativa or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a hybrid or you know whatever and so
I think you know you know knowledge behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the product and the way that you know you
market yourself and all of that and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know all of that is very relevant in
today's because you know kids kids now you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you're on Instagram and you're just
kind of scrolling through scrolling
[SPEAKER_01]: through you know then all of a sudden you
see that picture of a bud with diamonds on
[SPEAKER_01]: it you know and all of a sudden you stop
and look at it and you're like wow that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks amazing you know and you give it a
like you know and you might fucking give
[SPEAKER_01]: it a fire comment or something like that
you know but you know and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like what we're kind of you know is
there's like driving down the highway and
[SPEAKER_01]: you see a billboard with a bikini girl on
you're gonna take a look at you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: so everything is kind of like you know you
know for the moment and I think you know
[SPEAKER_01]: as as turps are now become a big part of
the equation it's just not the looks of it
[SPEAKER_01]: now you're talking about the smell of
things and so when you open it open a jar
[SPEAKER_01]: of that old-school sour diesel on you and
you just smell it and you just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know all of a sudden all of these
other senses get activated in your brain
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the smell of that the sense of
smell is very strong you know it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling a woman or smelling something
that is enticing and and so you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I kind of you know compare cannabis
the same way because when you crack that
[SPEAKER_01]: jar and you and you smell that you know
and that's the first thing you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: you how you judge things is by the smell
and now you look at it and you smells
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing and it looks amazing that so that
must mean that it must be amazing you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and as we all know that's not always the
case you know trying to get something to
[SPEAKER_01]: check all the boxes is is is very rare you
know there are you know a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that do fit that description but you know
that's kind of like you know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: where I think you know the future is you
know it's just you know it's ever-changing
[SPEAKER_01]: market you know even when you're judging
something you know if you're in a contest
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever you know I could speak from my
past experiences being a judge you know
[SPEAKER_01]: once you smoke they the fifth or tenth
thing the effect is non-existent you know
[SPEAKER_01]: so what so by what so if you're judging
now what are you judging you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: judging by effect anymore now you're
judging by the way this smells and the way
[SPEAKER_05]: that it looks you know so not so Doug
mentioned something similar in one of his
[SPEAKER_05]: podcasts as far as the ego clash which is
a hash competition here in California and
[SPEAKER_05]: he said you know you're judging so much
hash in such a short period of time that
[SPEAKER_05]: you know after the first couple of dabs
that's it there's really no way to do it
[SPEAKER_05]: now the Emerald Cup is a little bit better
because they give the judges like judging
[SPEAKER_05]: packs and you know they have them for you
know over a month so they're you know they
[SPEAKER_05]: have time to go through it and you know be
a little bit more conscious of the effect
[SPEAKER_05]: but even with that they have so many
entries that they're going through that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's pretty hard to judge the you know it
is yeah so um I I wanted to we talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about Klopp and the sour story a little
bit but I wanted to get back to that just
[SPEAKER_05]: a little because I feel like we we glossed
over it and the sour is something that you
[SPEAKER_05]: know not only a lot of people want to know
about but it's also a big part of the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're doing today yeah you know so I
have some thoughts about the sour you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I was you know I was there you know buying
weed from Klopp the whole time and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what we do know is that you know
seeds were found in a bag of 91 that Klopp
[SPEAKER_01]: sold to Vondo and Vondo lived upstate with
a guy named Maxwell and they both lived
[SPEAKER_01]: together and they sprouted those seeds
that they found from Klopp that became the
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel number one and two and recently
Maxwell went on a different podcast and he
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of elaborated on he came you know
because Maxwell was he had dropped out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the scene he had started a family you know
and just really got back on the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: within the past couple years and so AJ
went on a podcast with him and they kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of confirmed a few things I didn't know
really at the time but so those guys were
[SPEAKER_01]: both living together had the diesel one
and two they were growing that but also
[SPEAKER_01]: they had in their room the RFK I guess
that Klopp gave them and they also had a
[SPEAKER_01]: purple kush seed that they had gotten from
Kyle Cushman and you know I've talked to
[SPEAKER_01]: Maxwell and we've kind of bounced back and
forth some some different ideas but we do
[SPEAKER_01]: know that those four plants were in the in
the room diesel one diesel two RFK purple
[SPEAKER_01]: kush one of those plants hermed well we do
know that the RFK had a very strong
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation of of herming and that was one
of the reasons why Klopp got rid of it
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you didn't clip off the
lower branches it usually would throw a
[SPEAKER_01]: herm or two so you know that to me you
know that probably would be one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: strongest candidates to that would have
hermed in the room and it pollinated I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know if it was the diesel one or the
diesel two they grew they grew out that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and sold that weed to a guy named
Manny and Manny found the seeds and grew
[SPEAKER_01]: them out that really became the sour
diesel and so we know that I know I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: really I'm not a hundred percent sure but
I'm pretty sure that Vondo went out to
[SPEAKER_01]: California and I don't know if he had the
diesel one or diesel two clone or he had
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten seeds from Manny but there seems to
be some kind of connection I guess Vondo
[SPEAKER_01]: when when was that well it had to be Vondo
I think that he left for California in 94
[SPEAKER_05]: and are you saying that he did the got
those seeds before them well he all those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys were friends and they were part of
this connected e Albany crew so because to
[SPEAKER_05]: give you so to give you a little
information when Vondo came out to
[SPEAKER_05]: California he had nothing nothing and
didn't know how to grow and I know this
[SPEAKER_05]: because I gave him everything and taught
him how to grow I was partners with him so
[SPEAKER_05]: he didn't come out with the sour or the 91
or he didn't have any of that stuff yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have to yeah you'd have to clarify
that with him but you know I heard it you
[SPEAKER_01]: know there was a rumor that he might have
had brought in seeds out there I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if that was true or not you'd have to
you know have to ask him and really the
[SPEAKER_01]: real players in the whole sour story is
really you know Vondo Maxwell and Manny at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the day those three guys AJ
myself and other people were kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: involved afterwards you know AJ more than
me I know that Manny you know he was
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to the bro you know Keith in
Albany so that was you know that that
[SPEAKER_01]: connection with the bro the bro brought
sour clones out to Amsterdam at some point
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 90s I guess through man Manny so
you know so really you know these guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: still around you know and you know you can
really you know if you can get Maxwell on
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Vondo on and Manny on you know
those you know those guys are the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that that really know these really
intricate details you know a lot of a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff you hear through through you know
different channels through the years and
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah you know the story changes
because a guy like Maxwell comes out after
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 years and tells his side of the story
where Vondo you know he's been around but
[SPEAKER_01]: he's never really really told really kind
of like you know what what happened in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room or what strains they had in the room
you know there was no really specific
[SPEAKER_01]: details behind any of that until Maxwell
came out so you know you know as time goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on you know these guys may be willing to
talk to find out the details of everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else but as far as I know this is this is
as much as we know as as of right now well
[SPEAKER_05]: I just looked up in my phone and I still
have Vondo's phone number so yeah I can
[SPEAKER_01]: give him a call I don't know Maxwell you
might well you can contact he's Wild
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Cannabis Wild Mountain Cannabis
on Instagram but also you know you can
[SPEAKER_01]: probably get through to him through AJ
because I think both of them are working
[SPEAKER_01]: on seed projects together so Wild Mountain
Cannabis and AJ Sauer those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely they did another podcast and
they had elaborated on on some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff so that was how I became aware of it
but you know that but then you know I got
[SPEAKER_01]: into a conversation with Maxwell and you
know we you know just you know I was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of curious about it myself so there was
definitely some more to dig into yeah I
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like it's the the topic that we will
never we will never completely get dug
[SPEAKER_01]: into you know and everyone is kind of like
you know on the search for the real sour
[SPEAKER_01]: and what happened to the sour is it real
is it fake like you know so like
[SPEAKER_01]: originally there was only one cut of the
sour which was originally known as the AJ
[SPEAKER_01]: Sauer because AJ was the one that brought
it down to the city and he was the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that started selling trays of it you know
and then he was set he was setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: other people like Wing Wang you know he
was setting up other rooms you know and so
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was getting pieces of the room so
it was in his interest to spread the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: around because there was there was never
enough of it you know and so like yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: could literally just have well no one
could produce that much you know because
[SPEAKER_01]: most people were only running like five
lights you know maybe ten lights back then
[SPEAKER_01]: was a really big grow so like most people
didn't have ten lights you know like the
[SPEAKER_01]: most I ever had was eight you know and so
you know back then you know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: things were scary back then the bigger
that you got the more you know the more of
[SPEAKER_01]: a chance something something could happen
in it all depending on the logistics of
[SPEAKER_01]: where you were the growth the building
your neighbors we were doing it all in
[SPEAKER_05]: home yes we weren't ever doing so we
always had power limitations and you had
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors to worry about landlords to deal
with so there was always you know carrying
[SPEAKER_01]: bales of pro mix everything you know just
you know getting garbage out the door
[SPEAKER_01]: getting getting stuff up into you know
just back the back and forth you know
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying garbage bags at night time
filling up a you know a suburban parked
[SPEAKER_01]: out front you know and just speeding off
and dumping the garbage you know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows where but yeah you know it was
you know it was different back then it was
[SPEAKER_05]: you know I I made a video I'm not sure if
you saw it it was one of the first videos
[SPEAKER_05]: that I made and I tell a story about how I
lived in on the third story in Brooklyn
[SPEAKER_05]: for my first growth did you hear that
story that's insane I flushed all my soil
[SPEAKER_05]: and all my garbage trash down the toilet
that's insane I was petrified I was
[SPEAKER_05]: petrified to put it on the street that's
how the cops would find out you know like
[SPEAKER_01]: they were going through people's garbage
you know what we did was we would just get
[SPEAKER_01]: like those big contractor garbage bags and
so you know you're just hauling the bags
[SPEAKER_01]: in and out of the you know building you
know just fill up the trunk of your car
[SPEAKER_01]: and speed off you know back then there
wasn't cameras or anything around so you
[SPEAKER_01]: could just pull up to really any kind of
industrial or commercial place and find a
[SPEAKER_01]: dumpster or wherever you could find some
garbage cans or throw it off on the curb
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere where it's gonna get picked up
or you know you can't really get away with
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff now with cameras
everywhere you know but back then yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you didn't want to have any any kind
of paraphernalia or anything in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garbage you know empty fertilizer bottles
or anything of that stuff you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you wanted to try to keep
everything as clean and as quiet as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible I found someone's dump like that
one time I was working that for an office
[SPEAKER_03]: furniture company and they had a dumpster
in the back I went down to go break out
[SPEAKER_03]: some you know break down some boxes and I
just started smelling I was like what the
[SPEAKER_03]: hell so I opened it up and sure enough
there was these garbage bags full of like
[SPEAKER_03]: premature plants that you know for
whatever reason they cut them down but
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah it's so funny that you brought that
up and that's what you had to do back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day you know it's the people that
didn't do that ended up getting locked up
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and and also you know you didn't want
to tell anyone like you were kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a hermit in a sense where you didn't have
people coming over to your house or the
[SPEAKER_01]: only people that came over to your house
were the essential people that knew that
[SPEAKER_01]: what you were doing it maybe helped you
out for watering when you're out of town
[SPEAKER_01]: or some kind of you know maintenance or
help maybe helped you trim or help solve a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in your room or whatever you
always had to have those kind of people
[SPEAKER_01]: around but outside of that like there was
no one you know it wasn't like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah let's come over to my house and let
me show you my plants you know you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to tell anyone anything you know so
you know being anonymous was the key yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure I tell another story about how
when I was already in California a friend
[SPEAKER_05]: knocked on my door one day oh yeah that's
the worst he he didn't know I was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is your peeping out windows
looking to see who is it and then all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden you got to get enough fucking balls
open up the open up the door to see who it
[SPEAKER_01]: is and and it's your friend you know
you're expecting I was so fucking pissed
[SPEAKER_05]: and he had no idea why because he didn't
know I was growing he had been to my house
[SPEAKER_05]: before but when he came to my house you
know there was nothing nothing out and he
[SPEAKER_05]: stopped by my house and he's like I was
just in the neighbor I was like dude don't
[SPEAKER_05]: ever fucking come to my house without
calling me first I was like and if
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that was a big tell like freaked
out that I fucking just stopped by to say
[SPEAKER_03]: hello yeah nothing's changed you know
because if someone stops by without
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting you up you're just like what the
hell like who's at my door I have kids so
[SPEAKER_05]: my my my doorbell rings all the time you
know like my neighbor's kids are always
[SPEAKER_05]: knocking on the door wanted to find my
kids and stuff so if I freaked out on them
[SPEAKER_01]: it wouldn't be good yeah I mean I remember
I was up at my house you know upstate and
[SPEAKER_01]: the cat skills and you know I'm talking
about a secluded place where you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even get cell service you know so all of a
sudden I get a knock at the door I'm like
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my god who is it you know I'm fucking
peeking out the window I'm like don't
[SPEAKER_01]: answer the door don't answer the door you
know they they leave they leave a note
[SPEAKER_01]: there just census I didn't I didn't I
didn't send in my census form and so the
[SPEAKER_01]: census people were up there knocking on my
door but something as stupid as that
[SPEAKER_01]: became like a fucking major fucking you
know anxiety attack and even you know up
[SPEAKER_01]: until today I you know I have PSTD you
know I have you know dreams of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the cops coming for me and and running
from the cops and you know if you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: busted you know and I've been busted
multiple times eight times two felonies
[SPEAKER_01]: you know but luckily all that stuff has
now been I know it's all been cleaned off
[SPEAKER_01]: yes because of legalization you know but
when you but when you've gone through that
[SPEAKER_01]: trauma of being locked up being having the
cuffs on you spending a day or two in jail
[SPEAKER_01]: like it really does something to your
psyche that you never really recover from
[SPEAKER_05]: you know and so yeah it's tough yeah for
sure people don't realize that the Mecca
[SPEAKER_05]: that the Catskills is for cannabis and has
been for a long time you know yeah it has
[SPEAKER_01]: been well you know it's a place where you
you're kind of secluded and everyone kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of minds their own business and you can
kind of come and go unnoticed like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I I lived at the end of a cul-de-sac
I was the only house on the cul-de-sac I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean there was one other one other house
on my street like it was very very
[SPEAKER_01]: secluded but you know I picked that
location for a reason you know and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: up there for like 12 years and I never had
a problem until one day I was cutting and
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened was my septic the pipe got
crushed outside the septic and so it
[SPEAKER_01]: backed up so I couldn't take a shower you
know and stuff so I was cutting and when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was driving home you know down in 287 I
got pulled over by the state cops and it
[SPEAKER_01]: became this whole ordeal where you know I
had a fertilizer bottle in the trunk and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just it was one flat wrong one red flag
after another I just saw the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: envisioning the whole thing going down
because really the New Jersey state cops
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't do anything to me other than you
know arrest me for the the pipe I had in
[SPEAKER_01]: the gram or two of weed I had and then
charged me with DWI but they were very
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking curious about you know growing in
the fertilizer bottle and such and so like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was in my name in the power
department the power was in my name
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was in my name so I could just
envisioning the New Jersey State Police
[SPEAKER_01]: calling the New York State Police and say
hey listen we got this guy coming down
[SPEAKER_01]: downstate you know run his name so they
run my name they get the power they look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the power bill they see and I remember
I remember because I was getting though
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get my power bill and they would give
you a rating on how much power you were
[SPEAKER_01]: using and they would be like you you are
number 100 out of 100 out of the most used
[SPEAKER_01]: power you know you most use power in the
area some shit like that and I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: showing my friend I'm like look at this
you know and so so I can I envision them
[SPEAKER_01]: calling you know the New York State Police
don't think they got to do is run the
[SPEAKER_01]: power record look at the power record oh
it looks pretty high okay so we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: go up and do a walk around and that's what
they would essentially would have done
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have came up to the property
look in the trash looked in well there was
[SPEAKER_01]: never any trash because I brought all my
trash downstate there was no garbage
[SPEAKER_01]: collection there so everything I brought
out and but but they would what they would
[SPEAKER_01]: do is they would walk around the house to
see if there was any tell signs of a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: any smell any anything that would tip them
off to be able to try to get a warrant and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the next thing they would do is try
to make contact try to find out when you
[SPEAKER_01]: were there try to talk to you just to get
you to open the door and such and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and this just anything to tip them off so
they can get a warrant so I just you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I envisioning all of this happening and I
was just like starting to you know get
[SPEAKER_01]: popular with the seeds and everything and
I was like yeah this is not going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: down like this and so I just pulled the
plug you know I shut the shut the room
[SPEAKER_01]: down I I chopped every you know once I got
well I had chopped at that time and I took
[SPEAKER_01]: everything out of the out of the house all
because it was drying and I was like me
[SPEAKER_01]: they might fucking come at any time so I
was paranoid so I fucking moved all I had
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring all the wet weed down to the city
and dried it down there and bagged it up
[SPEAKER_01]: then I had to get rid of the garbage and
then I had to break down the room and so
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole thing was like a fucking mad
scramble within like a couple and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they never came I don't know if they ever
came they might I don't know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's but my main thing was just fucking
pulling the plug and getting and ending
[SPEAKER_01]: the project because I had already been up
there like ten or like twelve years so I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that's a good run in one fucking spot
you know so I was I ain't gonna press my
[SPEAKER_01]: luck to see what's gonna happen next I'm
just gonna fucking bail out now so and I
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and that's what I did I shut it
down I sold the house and then I decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to come to Colorado where I could you know
grow legally and not have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: getting arrested and I just wanted to make
seeds at that point so you know and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really you know how I really wound
up in Colorado was just that and is that
[SPEAKER_05]: where you're at yeah but now I want to go
back I see sometimes I see sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in New York City for like yes I
want to go back to New York but my wife
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't want to go back so but now I mean
when I came out to Colorado Colorado was
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mecca of the industry of the cannabis
scene like they had just gone wreck the
[SPEAKER_01]: first wreck state like that was in 2015
and you know now as you know other states
[SPEAKER_01]: opened up people use their experience to
go to you know different states and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so really like everyone that was here
that made you know kind of the Mecca it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all gone now there is there is no more
scene here in Colorado anymore so now that
[SPEAKER_01]: scene exists in New York now and so and I
don't think I don't really see ever really
[SPEAKER_01]: going away there because New York is a
very unique you know thing in itself
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're dealing with a mass
population of people with the majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: them having the money that they have to
get whatever they want you know meaning
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know these some of these super
rich people you know they just don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: the best they want the best of everything
and that was really how the sour diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of fit into the whole equation of the
New York scene was because it was like the
[SPEAKER_01]: quintessential the creme de la creme of
cannabis at the time and so you know just
[SPEAKER_01]: like everything else in life people want
the best and when they have the money
[SPEAKER_01]: they're willing to pay for it and they you
know and that's all that they want they
[SPEAKER_01]: just want results they don't want anything
else but results so when you deliver that
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can charge eight hundred or a
thousand dollars an ounce as AJ did and
[SPEAKER_01]: other people did and because that's you
know people wanted their stuff they would
[SPEAKER_01]: prepay for it and you know that's how it
went down back then it just was not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: supply back then so you know you're
dealing with a whole different type of
[SPEAKER_01]: customer out there and it still exists
today to where you know we're doing these
[SPEAKER_01]: pop-up events and it's just people you
know it's basically people that got you
[SPEAKER_01]: know two three four five lights and you
know we all come together and you know we
[SPEAKER_01]: have these pop-up events and people could
come and they can go from table to table
[SPEAKER_01]: and they could look for the best sour
diesel or the best Kush or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they're looking for and they you know or
they might like a specific grower or or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever and so they it gives the consumer
an opportunity to get a higher product and
[SPEAKER_01]: they give the farmers an opportunity to
move their product straight to consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: and so and is this safe and it's safe yes
you know it's not legal it's not legal no
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you know and and I think you know
that model is going to continue to exist
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't think that the New York
market is going to be able to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with the product you know like I
mean there might be some a few but like
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone that's mass producing any of these
the only people that are gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with that or the micro grows
that's it you know if you're one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys that got or people that have a brand
well that's what well see that's that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the thing where the New York market
is now if you're if you're a wreck grower
[SPEAKER_01]: like you can't like you got to sell your
you got to sell your guy to you to a
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor and then the distributor I
don't know I don't know who brands if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor or or the dispensary so like
essentially like you'd have the you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter what your flower brand
is as a grower if they're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: brand your flower as such they can brand
it any way they want to so you can't brand
[SPEAKER_01]: your own weed there you know and really
essential what happens is all the power
[SPEAKER_01]: now becomes of the broker because the
broker is the one that's kind of that that
[SPEAKER_01]: is the middleman between the former in the
dispensary so you got to sell to the
[SPEAKER_01]: broker and the broker can be like well I'm
only gonna give you so much Ford or you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and then he could turn around on the
other side you know it doesn't matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: you know on the retail side of it it
doesn't matter what they pay for they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just gonna they're just gonna charge
double you know so that's pretty much how
[SPEAKER_01]: retail works so as a dispensary you're
gonna buy a wholesale pound and just
[SPEAKER_01]: double it at the minimum at the minimum
you're gonna double your money on that so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know as so you know those guys are
gonna be making just as much as the farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak you know of course they got to
move the product and everyone's got to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with overhead prices and everything
but you know as as the market you know
[SPEAKER_01]: shakes out you know it always seems you
know even in regular agriculture that the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer always gets the short end of the
stick and he's the one that's producing
[SPEAKER_01]: the product and so I think that's you know
a tragedy especially in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: really in any kind of agriculture because
if you know if you're doing putting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hard work you know you should be able to
at least have the opportunity to sell to
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer now you know in some
instances some people might not be geared
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell to the consumer and they only want
to sell wholesale but you know as a micro
[SPEAKER_01]: craft former that's what you want and
that's where I think it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: profitable you know one question or one
topic that we've brought up here a number
[SPEAKER_05]: of times in the podcast and I'd like to
hear what you think is how do you define a
[SPEAKER_01]: craft grower that's a hard that's a hard
question you know and so I guess at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day it would be like the
product I mean the quality of your product
[SPEAKER_01]: right you know and so and then I guess
then you can break it down to how many
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and then you could break it down to
it is it organic and then you could just
[SPEAKER_01]: keep breaking it down more and more I
guess if I guess to where what your
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of craft is but like to me
craft is more small scaled should we say
[SPEAKER_01]: now what that number of lights or what
that square footage is is hard to say so
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know even in you know a black
market grow you know is it 10 lights is it
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 lights like what where where where is
it you know where is is it's too much for
[SPEAKER_05]: one person but now if you have two lights
and it's crap you're not crap right right
[SPEAKER_05]: you know so now and if you have a hundred
lights and it's fire is that crap yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: can consider that you know but that is a
lot of what you know to pull that off and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that it's not possible but
it's a lot of work you know and the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: with two lights can give his X amount of
plans way more attention than the person
[SPEAKER_01]: with a hundred lights now if you got left
it guy with a hundred lights has 50 yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna say now if he's got like a
you know you know that many employees but
[SPEAKER_01]: there's you know there's a balance of a
business of the business part of it where
[SPEAKER_01]: you know expenses take over you know I'm
saying so it doesn't you know there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very fine balance of trying to find trying
to find that that craft mark I don't I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what it is and in theory you
would think the smaller the better easier
[SPEAKER_01]: now you know if once you get that model
down can you upscale that model into
[SPEAKER_01]: something bigger that's the question now
is it a hundred lights all right but is
[SPEAKER_01]: that ten ten rooms with ten lights or is
that 20 rooms with five lights like is
[SPEAKER_01]: that possible you know so you know I think
you know there's a lot to be you know
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered in now all that because most
people that are gonna do a hundred lights
[SPEAKER_01]: just got one room with a hundred lights
they don't have ten rooms with ten lights
[SPEAKER_01]: because now they got to have ten air
conditioning units ten dehumidifier ten of
[SPEAKER_01]: ten more of everything you know and so I
think a lot of it has to do with the cost
[SPEAKER_01]: of things where people and I've seen this
over and over again where they get you
[SPEAKER_01]: know X amount of million dollars they
build out a grow and then they find out to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the grow rooms aren't aren't designed
properly and they're like well we spent
[SPEAKER_01]: ten million dollars you know well you know
you guess what you know you got to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: another two million to rectify you know
the engineering defects in there and and
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's you know a part of the problem
where you got people that are in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that necessarily don't belong in cannabis
they don't come from they don't come from
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't come from the culture they come
from a business background and they see
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in dollars and cents which you
know let's face it to to run a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: business you have to have a sense of that
you know but you also got to have a sense
[SPEAKER_01]: of a long-term plan in sight of experience
on exactly you know how you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: things and so when you get a guy that is
you know you get some guy that's a real
[SPEAKER_01]: estate guy that got a got a light a legal
license and he's got ten million dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know he now all of a sudden he you
know employed you know employed one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these consultants and he don't know what
the fuck he's doing and you know and it
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know it's just a downhill effect
all the way down to people of incompetency
[SPEAKER_01]: that are designing and building and in
setting up businesses that they have no
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of how it really works because in
theory you could have X amount of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna produce X amount of pounds
and you're gonna get X amount per pound
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and on paper you know it all
fucking it's all at work you know you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be fucking super profitable but at the
end of the day when when you know you fail
[SPEAKER_01]: your test testing you can't get your
product out the door or you get your
[SPEAKER_01]: product out the door and it's worth half
of what you thought it was going to be and
[SPEAKER_01]: so you know and when you got these big
investments and you know investors you
[SPEAKER_01]: know to answer to and things aren't
running like they're supposed to you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that it just doesn't work you know but on
paper I mean it really does work you know
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the end of the day you got to sell
all your shit you know I mean and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't sell it sell it you know what what's
it worth it's only worth what people are
[SPEAKER_05]: willing to give you yeah for sure my my
opinion on what a craft grower is is has
[SPEAKER_05]: been evolving and still trying to figure
it out so I appreciate you giving your
[SPEAKER_05]: feedback on that I remember when I asked
Kevin what he thought because you know
[SPEAKER_05]: originally my thought was look if you grow
this with love and with the intention of
[SPEAKER_05]: growing the highest quality product you
know to me that's crap if it comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: like that just because you have those
intentions don't mean the results are
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be that so that that's what Kevin
said Kevin said the road to hell was built
[SPEAKER_05]: with good intention you know so it's
exactly that but you know one thing about
[SPEAKER_05]: size is that I believe that you know some
of the larger facilities they also have
[SPEAKER_05]: you know they've built nicer grow rooms
with more control you know with you know
[SPEAKER_05]: monitoring that small growers don't have
so I don't think that size is really what
[SPEAKER_05]: decides if it's craft I mean in the end
it's the quality that comes out if the
[SPEAKER_05]: quality is really good then I think that
can be called craft cannabis no matter
[SPEAKER_05]: what the size of the garden is you know
I'm a member of a group on reddit and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: called craft marijuana that's actually
where I met cosmic and I was in the
[SPEAKER_05]: moderator chat and this is the topic that
was always coming up they would say well
[SPEAKER_05]: you know this room is too big you know so
that can't be craft because he's got over
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 lights and you know they they wouldn't
want to post that stuff or you know if it
[SPEAKER_05]: was a tent garden and the guy wasn't doing
a perfect job they didn't want to post
[SPEAKER_05]: that and you know I felt like hey you know
what if you're growing with love and like
[SPEAKER_05]: I said the intent intention of growing the
highest quality product that your goal
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't how do I make the most money but if
your goal is how do I grow the best weed I
[SPEAKER_05]: like to think of that as craft but you
know as we continue to have the discussion
[SPEAKER_05]: I realized that you know I still don't
know what craft cannabis is but also like
[SPEAKER_01]: with them in doing that they're really not
really helping anyone because even though
[SPEAKER_01]: that person might have the right intention
he might be doing something wrong and
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas someone in the group could help
him to point out hey listen this is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: working for me or I see that you're doing
this wrong or or whatever and you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: really you know the you know when you were
in those groups and even you know when we
[SPEAKER_01]: were on the forums back in the day that's
what it was all about was trying to help
[SPEAKER_01]: each other you know because everyone
didn't have the information that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: today you know back then you know there
was a few books that you were a few grow
[SPEAKER_01]: books that you were able to get maybe in
some kind of underground bookstore or in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of high times or then you know
then you'd have to get those high times
[SPEAKER_01]: mail to your house so it was always you
know a big deal and trying to purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: information and you know and so when
you're dealing with people that are all
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the same thing and you know maybe
you know people using different methods
[SPEAKER_01]: and and really that's was really you know
the the forums kind of brought all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: together and then it also helped you know
shape the community whereas you know
[SPEAKER_01]: someone in California can mail someone in
New York a clone in New York can send
[SPEAKER_01]: someone to someone in California so then
there you know there you know it also
[SPEAKER_01]: opened up this big exchange of of genetics
that you know we never saw before where
[SPEAKER_01]: before like you had to know someone like
you know if you didn't know those guys in
[SPEAKER_01]: in Virginia or if you didn't know who who
Greg was like you know you never would
[SPEAKER_01]: have gotten any of those cuts or anything
because you know and back then it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: it was about all about who you knew and it
was really a very small niche community
[SPEAKER_01]: where you weren't going around telling
people yeah I'm a grower this and that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you kept everything under wraps so
when you when you finally went when one
[SPEAKER_01]: grower actually finally did you know meet
another grower under the right
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances you know it was like a match
made in heaven because you know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you had some two alike minds and they
could exchange information they could
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange genetics and so it just opened up
you know all of this you know information
[SPEAKER_01]: for everyone and you know the genetics
also and so you know you know that's one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing about you know you know the American
weed scene is we're very passionate you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we've always been very passionate
from from the very beginning and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what it was just kind of what
what kind of drives us I think you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: sets us apart from people in Amsterdam and
people in Spain and people anywhere you
[SPEAKER_01]: know because now we're the weed Mecca of
the world right now everyone is watching
[SPEAKER_01]: what the what we are doing and and so you
know we just got to just keep me trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep you know moving things forward in the
right way and you know and I think helping
[SPEAKER_01]: people and to encourage people to grow and
you know like for me I'm it I know I sell
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds so like the home grower is my
customer you know that guy that's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that wants to start something in a tent
with one or two lights and you know he
[SPEAKER_01]: he's reading about the sour diesel but he
can't get the sour diesel clones so he
[SPEAKER_01]: could buy my seeds and try to get a good
representation of it and so that's always
[SPEAKER_01]: been kind of like you know when I was
breeding it was always about preservation
[SPEAKER_01]: for me in the beginning like we would get
certain clones and we would lose them and
[SPEAKER_01]: then be like oh they're gone forever you
know and and I would and I'd be selling
[SPEAKER_01]: the weed and so customers I had direct
feedback from the customer and I'd be like
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd be like yeah I like that northern
lights and I'd be like Mike what happened
[SPEAKER_01]: to the northern lights oh we lost it I'm
like dude you know like that shit was
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking you know popular and so you know
so when I started growing you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: then started coming in contact with some
of these clone only strains I was like I
[SPEAKER_01]: gotta you know at least try to make some
kind of cross or get some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: representation even if it's not an exact
cross of what it is if it's 70 80 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: of what it is that's a home run for me so
so that that you know and so trying to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and so I use my experience and my
taste in in you know with the sour diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: and with the hazes and so I try to
recreate those experience for other people
[SPEAKER_01]: to try so they can buy a pack of seeds and
they can get the sour diesel or or they
[SPEAKER_01]: can get the PIF or they can get the chem
or whatever so that's really you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's really been you know my main focus
in breeding and you know it's always been
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to move and also try to try to move
the gene pool forward as we as we go along
[SPEAKER_01]: we just want the gene pool to get better
and better and we've you know you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: you know looking back you know 30 years of
smoking 30 40 years of smoking weed you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I can I can I can say that we've
really moved things forward when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked that first joint in 1979 of some
Mexican or some Colombian crap or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: where that doesn't even matter anymore you
know you don't see those maxi mids or
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaicans or any of that imports anymore
actually now from what I hear we export
[SPEAKER_01]: where where people in California are
exporting to to the UK to Thailand to to
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe like people want you know to try
the runs they want to try the sherbets and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other you know all these strains
that they see and read about on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet and you know and that's why you
know the internet is a very you know
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful tool in communication you know
because you know you you know you could
[SPEAKER_01]: put up a and I could just speak from my
own experience you put up a dank picture
[SPEAKER_01]: or something of a plant someone grew from
your seeds and like yo that looks dank you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I want to get some of that you know
and so you know it's very powerful the you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much sell my seeds wholesale to
you know many different people that sell
[SPEAKER_01]: on Instagram they also have websites and
stuff like that I couldn't really name all
[SPEAKER_01]: of them but I also sell seeds direct from
from me to the customer if you if you
[SPEAKER_01]: email me at top dog seeds at protonmail
.com you email me I'll send you a list and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can pick out what you want and we can
move forward if you want I haven't really
[SPEAKER_01]: set up any kind of a legal website or
anything like that just because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: of of processing problems and pretty much
payment stuff like that is you know a top
[SPEAKER_05]: dog is top da wg correct correct yeah he
doesn't call it top dog dog it's da wg
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and to be honest with you or not you
know I'm always honest but I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at your your posts and stuff and
this hour is it the ones that I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: photos of those f5 or f6 most of them are
f5 I think there are a few f6 that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there now so when I started the sour
project I pretty much you know had the
[SPEAKER_01]: original sour clone that we had from AJ
back from the you know late 90s early
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000s so I had that and I crossed it with
the trade dog and the trade dog was afghan
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D and then cross back crossed two
more times to the Chem D so when I made
[SPEAKER_01]: that when I made that mail you know I kind
of was trying to duplicate the Chem D
[SPEAKER_01]: which I never did like you know I had
gotten some chem I did the same thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem dog and yeah I was really looking
for that garlic onion chem like and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really more or less got kind of like a
chemi Afghani kind of you know so I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really particularly happy with the overall
results of that but you know when I made
[SPEAKER_01]: that I made it for also to try to make the
best male like the strongest weed and the
[SPEAKER_01]: best male so that was kind of my starting
point you know so I just decided to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that an out cross male so you know so that
that that that plant kind of grew kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: short stocky kind of afghan kind of Chem D
structure and so I crossed that to the to
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour diesel which was tall stretchy
you know kind almost a different you know
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite growth structure and so you know
I back crossed it three times you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to you know trying to get in as
much of the sour genetics as possible and
[SPEAKER_01]: so then I from the back cross three that's
when I started you know doing the f2s to
[SPEAKER_01]: f3s and so when I was making my selection
throughout the whole process it was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of easy because I was always looking for
the taller stretchy or plants that were
[SPEAKER_01]: more kind of chem I mean sour diesel and
structure where you know we were I would
[SPEAKER_01]: get some that were shorter and some are
kind of medium bushier type of plants you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so the sour diesel has a very unique
growth structure and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: distinguishable so that's how I would you
know make my selections as I went along
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you know I would you know I would
get a female and I would try to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the the growth and the smell and
and then I would just try to find a male
[SPEAKER_01]: that had the same structure and obviously
like you really can't test that male out
[SPEAKER_01]: until you know you grow the plants out and
so you know you just really got to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: conscious decision on on selection and and
just and just move forward and just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep keep it going and keep in breeding
as you go along until you find exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're looking for and so in the
early early ones you know we were getting
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot of shorter bushier plants I
mean they did have the sour profiles to
[SPEAKER_01]: smell to them but you know I was really
looking for the structure more and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I've really bred it back to the f6s
now and they're pretty much coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty you know pretty pretty stable
pretty in structure where not every not
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone but they're they're all pretty
much alike you know you might get a few
[SPEAKER_01]: that are kind of still on the shorter
squad or side but I'm just really trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get everything to where it's all kind
of like the same and so we're it's getting
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot closer now and so I just kind of
like held back now I've done the FC I just
[SPEAKER_01]: did a remake of the f6 and so I've got a
couple selections now that I've kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: have out that I want to kind of just grow
out and see you know how good they are and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe get them into production and you
know see exactly you know how it how it
[SPEAKER_01]: you know how it turns out but you know
it's funny how everyone is like oh where's
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour what happened to it it's not
around anymore and you know like I was
[SPEAKER_01]: saying before there was only one cut in
the very beginning and so really you know
[SPEAKER_01]: as those as those cuts spread out I think
what what happens is you know you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is going to adapt to the
different conditions so if you're if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're if you're running your room with
organics and soil and I'm running mine
[SPEAKER_01]: with hydroponics and salts and my grows
got it's got PM it's got mites it's got
[SPEAKER_01]: this it's got that you know I think over
over a period of time you know my sour is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be different than your sour and so a
lot and I think a lot of showers you know
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point the sour is like what like
the 30 you know close to 30 years old now
[SPEAKER_01]: you know 25 years old no no I guess 95 90
yeah you say 95 like 30 years you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean so any any plant that's been passed
around for 30 years is going to be you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know the genetic drift or
whatever epigenetic changes yeah due to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know environment to pests for
fertilizers to light to everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and and I think that's why they call
it weed because it's it's adaptable you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it doesn't it doesn't just stay the
same I think it's kind of been proven you
[SPEAKER_01]: know even in in some clone you know some
plants where you can take multiple clones
[SPEAKER_01]: off of one plant and have three different
plants from the from the same from the
[SPEAKER_01]: same plant you know so that in itself kind
of tells you the genetic diversity that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in one plant you know if you get
three different phenotypes off of three
[SPEAKER_01]: different cuttings off of one plant you
know so you know all of that I think you
[SPEAKER_01]: know over time makes the plant change and
so I think really what people are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for is really that sour diesel
woof if you want to call it that when you
[SPEAKER_01]: open the bag and you just kind of get
woofed by the smell of it and back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day it was very distinguishable of the way
that it smelled and everything and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you know smell and the taste yeah
and I think it's kind of lost some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: over time and I can just tell you from my
experience from other plants that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: had for a long period of time that
eventually they do go bad even like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened to the underdog the original
underdog that Mike Klopp made like
[SPEAKER_01]: originally that just kind of crapped out
now looking back did it have some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: virus or something something could have
been going on with it but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: something definitely made made it
degrading quality to the point where we
[SPEAKER_01]: got we just let it go and I think the same
thing happened with the super skunk like
[SPEAKER_01]: the super skunk like listen everyone says
you know there's different stories on it
[SPEAKER_01]: and and the one that Greg got was the one
that you gave them and it was the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike had and it was the one that kind of
got passed around in the Massachusetts New
[SPEAKER_01]: England area and from what I remember it
being like it was super like when you open
[SPEAKER_01]: that jar you just got like you know you
got that super skunk woof you know but the
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud itself wasn't super strong it was
kind of like you know it didn't get you
[SPEAKER_01]: super high or whatever it was very not
like the night no not at all you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: was bud light you know so you know
everyone's kind of chasing the roadkill
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk now they're chasing you know the
sour diesel and you know you know I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know like would the roadkill skunk you
know maybe there is someone out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that's got something but to me all that
kind of points back to Afghan gene
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics you know so if you really want to
really start from the beginning I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where the original skunks come from
Afghans it's kind of been documented you
[SPEAKER_01]: know through the years through different
people have written books so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth and you know so I you know I think
that you know the thios and and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff I think they eventually kind of
change over over time and depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: your fertilizers and everything and now
with lights changing and you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of we kind of have what we have you
know and there's always that chance of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if someone finding a needle in the
haystack and you know we you know but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you just got to keep looking you got
to keep trying and you know I I've always
[SPEAKER_01]: you know try to do these small kind of
little hunts of stuff you know that's land
[SPEAKER_01]: race or you know that and a lot of that
stuff is just for you know my own you know
[SPEAKER_01]: personal you know what I want to do you
know and there's you know some Thai stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I remember from back in the day that
I would like to get back and stuff so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of things that we've
experienced as smokers that we'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know recreate or we'd like to
experience again and so I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: part of like chasing the nostalgia of
certain strains or whatever and is just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to recreate some of that but you
know a lot of that stuff you know when we
[SPEAKER_01]: first experienced you know I think like
the overall the overall tolerance that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone has to weed now is so much more
because back in the day like during the
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s there were droughts you remember have
you ever been in a drought where you
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't find weed like I I've been in
through many you know and the last one I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember being in like 1990 in the early
90s where there was there's no weed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: found in the city or anywhere else and so
you know so overall you know if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going through a drought and you haven't
smoked for a few days or a week or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever how long it may be now you smoke
something like the super skunk and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know on today's terms may be bud light but
back then you were like wow I'm fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: super high so now with especially
concentrates and dabs and you know in the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC being at the highest that it's ever
been I think overall people's tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: are much higher and the nostalgia that
they remember as as a kid or back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day was because yeah just because they
didn't smoke anything in two or three days
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of a sudden they smoke something
got super stoned and you know that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the case and and you know you could
smoke Mexican if you didn't smoke you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoke for a week and get high so did
Jamaican weed used to be really potent oh
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah you know so like I mean it may
not have been you know kind bud but that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit would make you fall oh yeah you know
well if you got that you know the that
[SPEAKER_01]: that chocolatey lamb's bread or lamb's
breath or whatever they want to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: man that was the shit you know because
that was actually kind of like chocolate
[SPEAKER_01]: tie kind of and you know it was growing
you know in a different environment came
[SPEAKER_01]: out differently but yeah it definitely had
some some really super good effects to it
[SPEAKER_03]: is the novel novelty to back when you
first started smoking you know it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling that you were very used to you
know because I feel like that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: attributes to what I like to call the high
school right how often do you get high
[SPEAKER_01]: like you were in high school right well if
you stop smoking for a week or a month and
[SPEAKER_01]: if you smoke you will get that effect
again well I can actually say that the
[SPEAKER_05]: other day I got higher on weed than I've
gotten in years and it was on sour diesel
[SPEAKER_05]: so and I'm gonna tell that story in a
minute but before I do I just want to say
[SPEAKER_05]: because I want to finish saying this that
I've been watching you on social media and
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been seeing these hours and although
you know you're thousand miles away from
[SPEAKER_05]: me and I haven't actually gotten a chance
to to try that stuff it looks like sour
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel it does you know like when you when
you look at it you're like man that that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit actually looks legit and how's the
smell yeah it has a smell to it so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really a really really trying to do a
really proper hunt to find that one
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking really really I think you did a
really good job so really that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: what really needs to be done where someone
can really do like a hundred or two
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred you know plant hunt and really go
through that you know unfortunately like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I don't have you know those means
to do that that those type of hunts and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff so you know just trying to you know
trying to really you know get people to to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and that's the other thing like
you know you can make the best shit in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world if people aren't willing to do it
you know what what is it you know and so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I'm fortunate enough where people
you know we're buying my things and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in their reporting on it and you
know and after a while you know things
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of you know the the reputation
and the results kind of speak for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and so you know you just got a
you know I just got to thank people that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that are willing you know to to
to buy and grill my stuff and then and
[SPEAKER_01]: then and then report on it you know
because and a lot of this is you know like
[SPEAKER_01]: I said before like you know if you can
create the best thing in the world and if
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't get out there no one's going to
know about it and so you know and that and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's and that's part of the whole thing
and as a community I think you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know sharing and trying to you
know try to make things better for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone is you know in the end it helps
everyone I wanted to tell you about the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is here in Europe yeah your seats
are considered as craft as they can be you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's like people here in Europe are
actually your seats are very rarely
[SPEAKER_00]: available but when they are available
people buy them and for example in Austria
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there is a three dogs clone
circulating which is really appreciated I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you are very well known as a craft
breeder you know I appreciate that but
[SPEAKER_01]: even like like in in England where the
stall is the star dog became you know one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the most popular strains like I had
nothing to do with that you know someone
[SPEAKER_01]: bought a pack of star dog over there and
blew it up you know so like I can only be
[SPEAKER_01]: thankful for that you know where you know
he blew it up and it kind of took a life
[SPEAKER_01]: of its own and things were that good
that's what that's what happens and here I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really have a main distributor in
Europe so to speak I'm actually I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: been in touch with a couple guys in
Amsterdam and they're gonna there's one
[SPEAKER_01]: guy in Spain actually and then there's a
guy in Amsterdam they're gonna start
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying my seeds but I do hopefully plan
to come out to Germany for the Mary Jane
[SPEAKER_01]: event out with as in June so so yeah just
keep your eyes peeled for that hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna make that I've been contact I
will meet you there I've been contacted by
[SPEAKER_01]: someone and I've been invited I haven't
really gotten all the details on it yet
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think that's definitely something
that I want to be a part of that Mary Jane
[SPEAKER_05]: and opening of Germany yeah I'm really
wanting to get over there too because I I
[SPEAKER_01]: hear it's it's a special event yeah well
now you know it's pretty incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything is worldwide now and
that and that's just you know you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: connection to the internet where you know
we can talk to you know someone that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenia or or anywhere around the world
where they would never know who Top Dog
[SPEAKER_01]: was if it wasn't if it wasn't for that and
so now like the community is now actually
[SPEAKER_01]: now a whole world community where people
in Australia and Thailand and Europe and
[SPEAKER_01]: South America like everywhere around the
world you know it's really kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: wrap your head around you know it was
never really like my intention to have
[SPEAKER_01]: this happen or you know you know what
things or organically you know from from
[SPEAKER_01]: the from the beginning you know you know
that's the way things just happen and
[SPEAKER_01]: things take a life of its own and you can
only you just got to kind of go with the
[SPEAKER_01]: flow and just you know I mean just try to
not be do something stupid well I mean you
[SPEAKER_05]: you've had a legal you know cannabis brand
for for years now people have known Top
[SPEAKER_05]: Dog for a long time imagine my surprise
when the Slovenian Hobbit messaged me
[SPEAKER_05]: telling me that he's been hearing about me
on the internet and everything I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: people were talking about me on podcasts I
didn't even know you know and they gave me
[SPEAKER_05]: this nickname Staten Island which you know
you being from New York you can relate to
[SPEAKER_05]: how shitty of a of a nickname Staten
Island it's gotten better at least they've
[SPEAKER_01]: closed the dump okay so now it's just
toxic underground but but listen you know
[SPEAKER_01]: back then we were doing what we had to do
you know that as well as I do we were
[SPEAKER_01]: never like there was never any glory that
was part of this you know it was always it
[SPEAKER_01]: was always danger and on my eyes like it
in in the glory was getting paid at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day and not getting arrested
you know so there was no like pats on the
[SPEAKER_01]: back or you know internet you know
popularity or any of that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know you getting away with it was
was your reward and you wanted to just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of keep it at that it well now
everyone is you know waving their flag and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you know want to tell tell their
story where before you know you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to you know you want to say anything
so you know it's changed quite a bit now
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know for the better I think of the
plant where I think now some real research
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually get done into this where you
know you're getting universities and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know other establishments that are you
know in the research department to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually do some real you know real stuff
and you know and you know and if you know
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're looking you know you know just
on the passing of the skunk man but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know that the some of the research that
that that guy those guys were doing were
[SPEAKER_01]: just just light years ahead of everyone
it's you know you know so really you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I didn't you know agree with all
of his actions and such but you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I think that you know the you know
they had a way they were so far ahead of
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that like we were playing
checkers and those guys are playing chess
[SPEAKER_05]: more or less you know I was gonna make a
podcast another one just on this topic of
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam and Neville but since you mentioned it
now I can't stop myself from from bringing
[SPEAKER_05]: this up we did a podcast with DJ short
which hasn't been released yet I saw that
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the clip of that and I was looking
for I was like where is it where is it and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like you guys are holding out I know
not holding out I'm not like that I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have like a patreon yet where members get
it it's just I've been honestly I released
[SPEAKER_05]: a new sour myself and it's gotten such a
tremendous response that I've just been
[SPEAKER_05]: slammed but um when I released that little
clip I received some hate and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: really the first hate that I've received
on my podcast at all like it I've gotten
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing but positive responses from
everyone it's it's really been
[SPEAKER_05]: overwhelming and when I made this podcast
and I put that clip up just trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: honor Sam I received hate messages and
some to be honest with even racist but you
[SPEAKER_05]: know and I just want to say this again
because I think it's important that I am
[SPEAKER_05]: not defending anything that Sam or Neville
did whether they're scumbags or not
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't change the fact that they're
relevant and they've really contributed to
[SPEAKER_05]: our community and I don't know if Sam did
the things that he's been accused of I
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't seen any you know proof of it and
I don't know if you know Neville was a
[SPEAKER_05]: drug addict or any of the other terrible
things that they say about him but Sam did
[SPEAKER_05]: an incredible amount of work in cannabis
that probably or surely to this day no
[SPEAKER_05]: single person has ever done and Neville he
made all these genetics available you know
[SPEAKER_05]: like he was the first person to put his
face out there and be like yes send me
[SPEAKER_05]: money and I'll send you seeds and so even
though I received a whole bunch of and the
[SPEAKER_05]: hate came from people just want to choose
sides you know they're either on team Sam
[SPEAKER_05]: or on team Neville and my guess is that
probably neither of them are flawless
[SPEAKER_05]: human beings you know and they you know
but how can you deny the tremendous like
[SPEAKER_05]: the work that both of these guys did the
contribution that they both made for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis you know so yeah you know well
you know you it's kind of like today where
[SPEAKER_01]: you know back then you know I wasn't
really a part of you know the 90s
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam scene but from from what I've
been told you know it was very competitive
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Sam an American brought over
genetics all the all the genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much Amsterdam were founded on came
from Sam you know they might have had
[SPEAKER_01]: something undisputed you know yeah so we
can't really argue that you know and so
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the the practices of some of the
the Dutch business guys were kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: unscrupulous and they never were really
for the consumer they I mean even up until
[SPEAKER_01]: today now like they're very unreliable
like I mean I think that overall I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: they were gifted all of those genetics and
they screwed the whole gene pool up you
[SPEAKER_01]: know pretty much you know getting away
from the original the original stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: that Neville brought over there and really
you know you look at Sam yeah no I'm sorry
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam brought over but and if you look at
the the real history of it all like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know that the real heyday was really
during the Neville period and pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: from the late 90s to the early I mean I'm
sorry the late 80s to the mid 90s pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much and really the last hurrah was kind
of like the Jack Herrera and then after
[SPEAKER_01]: that it all kind of like all kind of like
went downhill and it was just kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a reshuffling of all those the same
genetics that you know the northern lights
[SPEAKER_01]: to skunk the haze to Afghan you know etc
and they were all this kind of reshuffling
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you kind of look at it now it's
kind of like all of that is kind of all
[SPEAKER_01]: that history is repeating itself today
where you got haters on the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to describe me they discredit you I
mean they're trying even today last two
[SPEAKER_01]: days I've gotten posts reported they're
trying to get my account deleted again
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been deleted twice already you know
so you got people that make up narratives
[SPEAKER_01]: about certain people and you know it's
just kind of like now it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: reshuffling of all the cookies and the
candy stuff and gelato gelatos all that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stuff on that realm and so it gets
kind of history kind of repeating itself
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sense you know where it just becomes
so competitive that you know you just want
[SPEAKER_01]: to take down the guy that's on top or you
know whoever you don't like and today's
[SPEAKER_01]: societies it's so much easier to try to
cancel people with you know someone just
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting posts or or whatever my
Instagram got taken down yeah like yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: like you know the I believe that the
person or one of the people that sent me
[SPEAKER_05]: the hate message he reported my Instagram
and somehow Instagram had me back on
[SPEAKER_05]: within like six to eight hours because I
was in a panic I couldn't believe if you
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal if you appeal it you know a lot of
those things they find out are bogus you
[SPEAKER_01]: know like how can you put a sexual content
on a flower picture how can you put
[SPEAKER_01]: violence on a flower picture and this is
the kind of stuff that's getting reported
[SPEAKER_01]: and post taken down for so I mean there's
an algorithm is there anyone that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: actually looking at some of this stuff I
don't think so you know because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably million there's millions of
accounts you know how much you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: many thousands of accounts this must
happen to a day it's just it just you know
[SPEAKER_05]: can't do it here's here's what they said
about me that I was supporting a dangerous
[SPEAKER_05]: organization and individual yeah I've
gotten that glorifying a terrorist attack
[SPEAKER_05]: supporting violence against a particular
group of people and supporting or
[SPEAKER_05]: promoting harmful criminal activity like
human trafficking it's what the fuck yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: you know like I don't even know how like
but because they reported me as such a
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculous thing Instagram was able to
quickly see that that that wasn't the case
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know luckily they didn't fuck with
me for the weed pics and female parts but
[SPEAKER_01]: it just shows you the power that some of
these people have that are nobodies that
[SPEAKER_01]: can just sit back in their mother's
basement and just you know just troll
[SPEAKER_01]: people all day long and you know there's
there's there's numerous people out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that do that on a regular basis that's
their main content is just to troll people
[SPEAKER_01]: and just to put negative you know energy
out there and so you just really you know
[SPEAKER_01]: got to try to stay focused and don't let
other people define who you are you know
[SPEAKER_01]: who you are and you tell people who you
are and you don't let anyone tell people
[SPEAKER_01]: who you are
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah I don't want to drag on this too much
but this person said to me what gives you
[SPEAKER_05]: the right to mention Neville in the same
breath as Sam when Sam died and you know I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know if this person is listening or
not but I give myself the right to talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about anything that I want on our podcast
but I try to keep it positive I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think I've ever talked negative about
anyone you know like that's not and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: there's been and I've this is the most
negative I've ever been on on our podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've had moments when I've really
wanted to like I have this platform and
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes I think like should I use this
platform to out out these scumbags that
[SPEAKER_05]: are out there that you know because people
are out there kissing ass to people that
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't know you know and they're like
this person's so amazing and it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: okay first of all this person is a
douchebag and second of all they really
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't contributed as much and the chem
dog people give me so much credit for you
[SPEAKER_05]: know the chem dog but the way I see it is
I just drove that shit across country and
[SPEAKER_05]: and gave it to some friends I didn't breed
it I didn't pop the seeds I mean I bred
[SPEAKER_05]: with it later on but most people didn't
get a chance to see that stuff but you
[SPEAKER_05]: know there are people that are just trying
to I don't know what you're saying I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to I don't want to take
because and I'll finish real quick because
[SPEAKER_05]: this is your show not mine but um like I'm
way more proud of this podcast that we've
[SPEAKER_05]: done in three months than anything that I
have to do with the chem dog story you
[SPEAKER_05]: know and when people you know give me
credit for the chem dog story and make it
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like this is my legacy it's like well
if that's my legacy I'm a loser if my
[SPEAKER_05]: legacy is I just drove this plant across
country and gave it to some friends and 30
[SPEAKER_05]: years later that's that's all we can talk
about you know so I'm really proud of this
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast I think in a couple months we've
done some great things the other thing
[SPEAKER_05]: that I think is my real legacy is the
garden spout you know my grocery shop and
[SPEAKER_05]: I taught so many people how to grow and I
taught og growers that were growing
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoors how to grow indoors and so like
those are things that I can be proud of
[SPEAKER_05]: and feel that are my legacy but the chem
dog that's not my legacy you know and so I
[SPEAKER_05]: just wanted to put it out there to the
world so that that people can get this
[SPEAKER_03]: straight you know but you know honestly in
your defense I don't you're the one saying
[SPEAKER_03]: this but without you you still played an
integral role you know with the chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: you know because I'm part of the story
right everyone has their own everyone has
[SPEAKER_01]: their own little part of it that's that's
the whole that's a beautiful thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: it because if there wasn't if there wasn't
if there wasn't a Mike Klopp if there
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't a Gabby like everyone's got their
own little there wasn't a Greg chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: like everyone's got their own little and
that's what makes this thing so beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: because it wasn't really intentional it's
just something that came to flourishing
[SPEAKER_01]: for you know like you were you were doing
what you had to do at that time to you
[SPEAKER_01]: were you know to better your life you know
you you know and so you know the decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: that we made in the past you know like we
you know doing certain things you know we
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing doing those things you know to
try to make ourselves better and to make
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you know things overall you know
just easier for you know people like that
[SPEAKER_01]: that we knew and you know and just as a
kind of like touching on on the Neville
[SPEAKER_01]: thing like you know Sam was the one that
brought all those genetics over and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Neville did you know like he he had
an eye for for certain things and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: like he went outside of the gene pool of
what Sam had gave him and when he got the
[SPEAKER_01]: northern lights and he went to you know
the Pacific Northwest and started
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting different strains and stuff
like that and so you know yeah a lot you
[SPEAKER_01]: know there's a you know those guys were
competition back then so you know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: they were they had work together and it's
just like today when you're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain people or whatever and you know
you're good for a while then you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: falling out and you know a discrepancy and
then you know that's how all of those all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those rumors and all that stuff you
know start to spread and everything and
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah I mean well I mean the the
allegations something I'm sorry to
[SPEAKER_05]: interrupt you the allegations are serious
no I know I know you know like so like I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want to minimize that there are
serious allegations against both these
[SPEAKER_05]: guys it just doesn't change that they
contributed right and I don't mention
[SPEAKER_05]: anything about what type of people they
are like I'm not saying Sam is a great guy
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm not saying Neville is a great guy
it just doesn't change that they
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute and that's true and the thing
you got to remember is you know you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just can't cannabis was illegal like
it brought a lot of different people into
[SPEAKER_01]: the scene you know that just weren't there
for the love of the plant they were there
[SPEAKER_01]: for more of the love of the money because
they had addictions or whatever case may
[SPEAKER_01]: be you know so you know it kind of changes
you know the whole thing when it just
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes more cutthroat in the end that's
really the bottom line is when you bring a
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal element into everything you know
and you know you can be both you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: could be you know contribute to the
community and still kind of not be the
[SPEAKER_01]: best person in the world and even today
there's a lot of people out there like
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know they're not their interests
aren't really with the community or with
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is a lot of it is just kind of
like financially driven and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: self-centered everything about me and you
know eventually you know that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized and you know if you want to you
know have you know have longevity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: game you really can't you know conduct
yourself like that because you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: know eventually you know you're the only
thing you know back in the day I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: say is the only thing that we had was our
reputation and how good we were on being
[SPEAKER_01]: like I can vouch for this guy saying he's
good and the balls to do something the
[SPEAKER_01]: balls to set up a grow the balls to do
something illegal to know the consequences
[SPEAKER_01]: if you get caught that you're probably
going to go to jail you're going to go at
[SPEAKER_01]: the very least you're going to get
arrested and there's a good possibility to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to jail and so you got to know all
these things going in and you also got to
[SPEAKER_01]: know that you're not going to be dealing
with the most honest people in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're doing something illegal so you
know the you know the whole thing just
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes a becomes a mess after a while
once you know things start getting you
[SPEAKER_01]: know out of hand and and we're dealing
with the same shit today in my opinion on
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet you know we just you know
back then people would just make up rumors
[SPEAKER_01]: to disparage other people and it's the
same thing that's going on today and to me
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to have proof if you're going to
call someone a rat or or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: allegations you have against them you know
especially if you're going to be called a
[SPEAKER_01]: rat like you got to come up with the proof
and the paperwork and such you know like
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise and and even today like you know
a lot of that back in the day like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know when we were on the forums and stuff
you know there was there was much more
[SPEAKER_01]: respect like you know if you got called
out you could easily get blackballed from
[SPEAKER_01]: the community and nobody would have
nothing to do with you and that's just not
[SPEAKER_01]: the case anymore you know like those kind
of people flourish scammers rats you know
[SPEAKER_01]: known rats should i say you know that are
on paper and they're still you know
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted in the community so the overall
standard i think is really kind of lowered
[SPEAKER_01]: now and really you know you just got to
try to you know surround yourself with you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a like-minded people that have the
same kind of morals that that that you
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have and really like a lot of the
younger kids now they just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand because you know all the stuff
that we kind of went through you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: only thing that they know is legal weed in
instagram and and so i mean it's much more
[SPEAKER_01]: than that you know when it really comes
down to the substance of everything are
[SPEAKER_05]: you a 91 guy or are you a chem d i'm a
chem d guy and that's really i know
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's really what my focus was
from the beginning with the trade dog yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean so that was always been like and
and the thing was i had the not i had the
[SPEAKER_01]: um the d before the 91 because i got the d
directly from greg like in 2004 2005
[SPEAKER_01]: shortly after he popped and found it and
he didn't have the 91 then and at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point i don't think anyone had the 91 on
the east coast i think you guys had it out
[SPEAKER_01]: west and brought it back a clop had it
right no he he he lost he lost it yeah he
[SPEAKER_01]: he lost he he went to uh everyone started
growing that underdog and uh so yeah but
[SPEAKER_01]: then um but you know a lot you know you
know a lot a lot of my breeding comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: my own personal tastes like the strains
and stuff like you know you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to find any terpenoline in most of my
stuff because i don't personally like
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenoline so i'm not going to breed with
those kind of plants i did do a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: with like a super silver haze star dog and
you know something like that but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a particular uh turp that i that
i like and so like a lot of a lot of my
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding is based on my personal uh
preferences and so that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: where breeding almost becomes an art
whereas it's it's it's the it's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what my personal uh tastes are in my
interpretation of it and such and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you you know and that's where in the
breeding you can kind of put that personal
[SPEAKER_01]: touch in on all of that on your selections
and everything because and i do all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that on my past experiences on smoking and
so like when i'm hunting for a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: type of tie or a certain type of haze or
or whatever it is it's because i something
[SPEAKER_01]: that i had experienced before i want to
try to recreate that for myself and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to offer that for other people to
experience and so that's really you know
[SPEAKER_01]: where a kind of you almost become an
artist in a sense i definitely think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: an it's an art and you know the the best
art is the art that the artist makes
[SPEAKER_05]: because he's inspired not like oh i'm
going to make something that other people
[SPEAKER_05]: like this is what's popular i'm you know
you know you're never going to make the
[SPEAKER_05]: best product that way if you make
something because it's what you love well
[SPEAKER_01]: either either you lead or you follow you
know and so there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to ride off of other people's
coattails and just you know and so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it is what it is you know you can't
really focus on that used to bother me in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past but now i can't you know i can't
focus on i i got to focus on on moving
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward and doing what i got to do
and and block out all of the noise around
[SPEAKER_01]: me you know it's like i try not to you
know i try to keep things relevant but i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really focus on like what other
people are doing you know i try to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on what i'm doing and if there's something
i feel that that something that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that might fit into what i'm doing
then i'll gladly incorporate that and give
[SPEAKER_01]: them credit for it i have no problem i've
used other people's breedings and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that you know and so um you know i'm
very open to uh really you know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't pop seeds the next best thing is
going to be found in a seed you know like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not anything that we're holding now
so it's like you got to keep hunting you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to keep breeding you got to keep
moving the genetic pool forward and then
[SPEAKER_01]: try to while preserving exactly exactly
you know exactly and so you want to you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to bring things forward but you want
to hold on to the past too right so are
[SPEAKER_01]: you doing any tissue culture no i've never
done any of the tissue culture now you
[SPEAKER_01]: know um you know i just do regular seeds
that people are always asking me about
[SPEAKER_01]: fems and autos and this and that and to me
uh a male and female you know when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking in into breeding you know you're
looking for hybrid vigor meaning you're
[SPEAKER_01]: finding a plant that's better than both
parents you know and so when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: opposites sometimes opposites attract you
put opposites and you put them together
[SPEAKER_01]: and you find you know better things and so
in genetics it's very you know complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and sometimes it's a crap shoot
you know and you can sometimes you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a vision on what you want to try to
create that doesn't necessarily mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen like you know but at least
you tried you know and just like i was
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining with the with the trade-off
while i was trying to recreate the chem d
[SPEAKER_01]: it just it just didn't happen you know but
you know what the male that that i you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the mail that i used out of that you
know it became a producer in itself with
[SPEAKER_01]: you know became the foundation of of my
genetic library pretty much you know on
[SPEAKER_01]: certain levels you know so that's really
what you got to really focus on and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know sometimes the glory doesn't come till
five or ten years after you know i can i
[SPEAKER_01]: can release a strain and you know just
let's just take the african haze for
[SPEAKER_01]: instance like i i released that you know
in like 2010 or somewhere in that area and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a guy named bronson he bought a
pack he found his african haze number 11
[SPEAKER_01]: up in maine and he blew it up you know and
it became like one of his you know staple
[SPEAKER_01]: um strains you know for himself you know
but with him blowing himself up he blew me
[SPEAKER_01]: up you know so you know you know those
things you can't really make happen you
[SPEAKER_01]: know they just happen organically and you
just got to be thankful for it yeah for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure um the star dog was that yours yeah
the star dog yeah so that was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: does this look like your packaging no no
somebody's giving me these they're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably you know someone to f to them or
whatever but you know but but that was you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the star dog you know i took that
same trade dog mail and crossed it to chem
[SPEAKER_01]: four you know and then you know i then i
wound up giving um my friends some seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was friends with high times and he
went to high times he gave kyle kushman
[SPEAKER_01]: some seeds he gave uh andre grossman the
photographer uh some seeds and uh andre uh
[SPEAKER_01]: he wound up finding the guava the guava
cam or um and and then kyle kushman took
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds out to california and those
guys grew them out and then they entered
[SPEAKER_01]: the san francisco medical cup in 2010 and
got second place so that really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: put me on the map you know and those guys
started you know uh leo uh and those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: up in and humble they started growing some
star dog and it became a production up and
[SPEAKER_01]: humbled there so you know that you know
there's another instance where where you
[SPEAKER_01]: know someone took my strain and just blew
it up and in the meantime blew me up you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and so you know i just got to give
thanks to that yeah you can't you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: make that you can't make that up and you
can't make that happen you know as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: you try you can promote and try to you
know do as much marketing behind your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and if there's no substance behind
it man people are just going to smoke it
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it will just get discarded you
know and when something's that good this
[SPEAKER_05]: takes a life of its own well before we go
i just want to do something that i think
[SPEAKER_05]: is funny so we're all brothers on this
show and you're our brother too today and
[SPEAKER_05]: and always jj but take a look at this
picture yeah you gotta move it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit over other way other way that's can
you see that yeah i can see it yeah man i
[SPEAKER_04]: swear you and clapper brothers you know
what do you what do you guys think cosmic
[SPEAKER_01]: and sasha that's it listen that's a young
clop and the old me so you still look
[SPEAKER_05]: young no you still look young look at me
bro i gotta wear a hat to hide the glare
[SPEAKER_05]: from the camera so and something else i
want to show you since i've been looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at your um beautiful sour this is the this
is the new clone that i got nice did you
[SPEAKER_04]: see the video that i posted on instagram
about it i don't think so no i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: have to look so so i have you know what
i've been erroneously calling the original
[SPEAKER_05]: sour because it's the cut that um you know
me and my friends have had and grown for
[SPEAKER_05]: you know forever for decades but like we
were talking about before it's gone
[SPEAKER_05]: through epigenetic changes and it's just
not um it's just not that good anymore
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not it's not it's it's good it's just
not the same it's not i know what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's missing that wolf you know i
mean yeah it's like that's the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: when you know and you know i could say
like some of my some of my seeds have one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the back cross threes has the wolf but
it doesn't quite have the you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not doesn't smoke quite as strong i would
say you know so but in today in today's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know kids now are just they don't
smoke to get high really you know they
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke to look cool so they you know they
want to smoke some kind of candy strain in
[SPEAKER_01]: the blunt and they want to smoke in a
blunt and look cool all day you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's kind of a status thing more
or less where where me you know just give
[SPEAKER_01]: me you know a little butter kem and a
party little party the 91 not to do and
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh you know i could take two or three
hits off off of a little pipe and i'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking way more higher than the guy
that's smoking the big fucking blunt after
[SPEAKER_01]: blunt after blunt a fucking candy you know
so it's all personal preference you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and what works for me doesn't work for for
everyone else so i can only go by what i
[SPEAKER_01]: like and you know the people that have the
same taste in the peel you know those are
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of people that you that become
your customers that are attracted to you
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know they have you know the
the same you know you know the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts that you have on cannabis or or
whatever so you know you know we find you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's funny because you know you you
watch someone on instagram or on on social
[SPEAKER_01]: media or youtube whatever and you get a
feel of who that person is you know i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you know their likes their dislikes
and you know you kind of have a you kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of you know have a you build an image of
who that person really is you know without
[SPEAKER_01]: really knowing them and just like you had
said before like you know you're you're
[SPEAKER_01]: picking sides or you're liking people that
you don't know you have no idea who they
[SPEAKER_01]: are you know you're only seeing little
little little flashes of glimpses of their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives on social media and it's really not
who that person really is behind the
[SPEAKER_05]: scenes well i that's why we're doing this
podcast and that's why it's not a 10
[SPEAKER_05]: minute podcast because we want to give our
guests a chance to tell their story and
[SPEAKER_05]: that way we can really get to know them
and yeah so yeah yeah that's why we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the show yeah you know and it's like
you'd only be judged by the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: you surround yourself with and those are
the people that who really know who who
[SPEAKER_01]: you are you know and and that's what i was
saying before where don't let anyone tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you who you are because you know you tell
people who you are yeah that that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: great if we wrap up cosmic i know you got
yeah sorry jj i'm just a huge fan of your
[SPEAKER_03]: work you know um i i have i believe i-95
is yours strange as well yeah i didn't i
[SPEAKER_01]: personally didn't do that money mike uh my
partner he he made that he made that
[SPEAKER_01]: strain you know he's not as active on
social media he's not on instagram or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that you may find him on um
uh on canna um ic mag um but on the forums
[SPEAKER_01]: there but yeah he doesn't really post too
much he's very kind of private personal
[SPEAKER_03]: family guy absolutely well i mean i love
the verbs that you work with and i was
[SPEAKER_03]: just you know as a fan of you know the the
strains that you've put together i was
[SPEAKER_03]: wondering what are you working on right
now and what are you most excited about uh
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean right now i'm i'm kind of like just
kind of remaking the sour you know i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing f6s um i'm doing a remake of the
star dog right now uh the dirty taxis have
[SPEAKER_01]: been really uh well received uh they're
making a you know big impact on on the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate game and you know finding its
way through the legal market some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities and stuff so that's exciting to
me um you know i've been doing some haze
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff i'm always working on the hazes so
um i've really been trying to um you know
[SPEAKER_01]: i just did this new thing called the disco
haze and so it's the cough times um kemdi
[SPEAKER_01]: original haze so that's more there that
original haze came from the flying
[SPEAKER_01]: dutchman and i believe that one's more of
a tie kind of a haze and so the cough is
[SPEAKER_01]: the same similar kind of a haze so that
one um yeah that one's really good i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting that to make some waves soon and
uh yeah you know just going through you
[SPEAKER_01]: know different things um i mean seed wise
just you know just doing some hunts and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that and uh you know maybe i'll
you know i'm really maybe going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe starting to focus on uh some turps a
little bit more but trying to stay within
[SPEAKER_01]: my gene pool and maybe you know maybe do a
little out thing but i'm not really sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you know exactly on on that direction yet
but it just seems like you know like i was
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining you know before about the turps
and everything i think that it's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more um in today's uh market on the way
things kind of smell you know and um like
[SPEAKER_01]: i said you know i smelled a very you know
powerful um sense and you know it's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: determination on on the quality of the
flower where people are not looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: effect as much as much you know so you
know you just got to kind of well it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like you said too with instagram
everything's visual based yes you're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at what looks the prettiest yes
and that's in their mind that's what sells
[SPEAKER_01]: and so i i necessarily don't i kind of
march to the beat of my own drum but i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: always i'm always you know conscious of
what's going on around me and where the
[SPEAKER_01]: market is heading and so i you know you
can't really lose sight of that even
[SPEAKER_01]: though you want to do your own personal
things and and everything and you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's good in everything but you know you
got to be you got to you got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: diversified i think in today's market
where you got to do your own thing and and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know your own niche thing and then you
can kind of touch on some of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: popular things and you know you just got
to try to find a nice rounded program
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to work for you depending on
you know how many lights you're running
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you know i wish i could fucking
run you know a hundred lights and be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: like these big population breeding
projects and and fino hunts and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that but it's just not possible you know
unless you're you know in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility and you know things like that so
um that's not really really what my main
[SPEAKER_01]: focus is because of the commercial game is
just fucking it is horrible over all
[SPEAKER_01]: around you know just like working in those
places and just it's just you know just
[SPEAKER_01]: just not me i'm more i'm more happy just
being kind of a small kind of a guy and
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know i would love to you know be
a legal brand and and all that but the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know regulations and the
licensing is set up it's just not set up
[SPEAKER_01]: for people to be profitable and it's like
if i'm going to invest my life savings in
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to start you know a business you
know like you know i i'm gonna i gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that it doesn't fail you know
because i you know at my age you know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not any going back you know so i
want to keep what i have what i've you
[SPEAKER_01]: know i've worked all my life for and you
know i have a little piece i could you
[SPEAKER_01]: know work with but like you know i'm not
going to do it unless i know i'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get instant results and in the way things
were at least a safe yeah exactly you know
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm back in the day at our age we're not
taking so many risks no but back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day if things were like they were back in
the day where you could fucking sell wet
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and it didn't matter what it was i
mean that's like a no-brainer like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know i mean like i'm all in on a
situation like that but it was a safe bet
[SPEAKER_05]: yes back then yes it's not a safe bet
anymore i won't mention anyone by name but
[SPEAKER_05]: you and i both know somebody that was at
mike's wedding that we were talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: could have been his best man if i didn't
if i didn't do what the priest said and to
[SPEAKER_05]: be honest with you he grew shit weed like
you know like it was oh but he always sold
[SPEAKER_05]: it yeah you know like you were able to
grow shit weed and and by the way if he's
[SPEAKER_05]: watching i fucking love this guy with all
my might that's why i didn't say that's
[SPEAKER_05]: why i didn't mention him by name but like
um yeah back in the day you could grow
[SPEAKER_05]: shit weed and not cure it properly and
sell it for fucking six thousand to ten
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand a pound you know it was insanity
you know so hey i want to ask you is this
[SPEAKER_05]: your instagram can you see that the real
top dog seeds yeah so i just wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure and give everybody an
opportunity to check out jj on instagram
[SPEAKER_05]: at the real top dog seeds and dog is da wg
and actually before we go i i mean we'll
[SPEAKER_05]: keep on having more questions but weren't
you the guy that originally called the dog
[SPEAKER_05]: you know that spelt it da wg yes yes and
my really tell us about it was the tray
[SPEAKER_01]: dog that really in a star dog that really
and so i really did that just to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: set myself apart you know from from greg
and the original chem dog guy and so i
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really want you know i you know i'm
not the one that was the sign of respect i
[SPEAKER_01]: can't take credit for the chem you know i
can only take credit for working with the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem and i can only be you know thankful
that it was passed to me and that i was
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do what i did with it you know and
so you know i i can't really take any
[SPEAKER_01]: credit for for the chem or anything like
that but you know i can you know take
[SPEAKER_01]: credit for what i've done with working
with it though and so i mean when we got
[SPEAKER_01]: it you know we knew it was something
special you know but back then like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we you know there were so many
strains back then you didn't really know
[SPEAKER_01]: the we didn't really know the whole
genetic pool like we know it now and like
[SPEAKER_01]: unknowingly like you know it was the best
weed that i ever got back in the day but
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm sure that there was other weeds that
were just as good if not arguably be
[SPEAKER_01]: better that that that we probably lost you
know and so um yeah like i said i was just
[SPEAKER_01]: lucky to be at the right place at the
right time and be able to get that strain
[SPEAKER_01]: not knowing that it was going to be what
it is today you know it's you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: was just dumb luck for sure and i see on
your instagram you have a discord is that
[SPEAKER_03]: a good way to uh you know if someone
wanted to put in you know an order or
[SPEAKER_01]: something yeah yeah the discord is a lot
more looser on the way we talk and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know stuff like that and i also have
another backup um instagram account top
[SPEAKER_01]: dog siege jjnyc so yeah uh the the discord
is um is is a little bit you know of a
[SPEAKER_01]: more stable platform where we could
actually have like conversations people
[SPEAKER_01]: can show you know uh what what they're and
really the discord is not even really
[SPEAKER_01]: about me it's like most it's mostly about
the users and they're the they're the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that are posting what they're finding in
in top dog seeds and talking about other
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that are relevant and can't you
know just a cannabis community and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything so it's really kind of set up
more for the users and people that that
[SPEAKER_01]: buy the seeds and i try not to like get
too involved in in editing comments good
[SPEAKER_01]: or bad you know if someone pops you know
pops a pack of my seeds and they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: happy they say your shit or whatever the
case may be like you know that's their
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion you know i'm not i'm not going to
cherry pick comments that are uh that are
[SPEAKER_01]: good and bad to make myself look better
you know uh the proof is in the pudding
[SPEAKER_01]: and if 10 people say it sucks i would
fucking i would bet that it probably sucks
[SPEAKER_01]: so on you know at the end of the day my
opinion doesn't mean nothing you know
[SPEAKER_01]: whose opinion matters or the people that
are finding the results you know and so if
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to be honest about and transparent
about everything and that's the way i've
[SPEAKER_01]: always been good and bad you know you're
not always going to hit a home run you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to you're going to you know get a
couple ones that aren't that aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the cut or whatever and you know
you just got to start editing out the bad
[SPEAKER_05]: comments then people know that it's that
it's not legit right you don't have the
[SPEAKER_05]: like you don't want to edit out all the
comments you know all the bad comments
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just no it's just and even you know
people can personally attack me or say
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they want about me like i said it
doesn't mean that it's true i mean but am
[SPEAKER_01]: i going you know just because they said
something that i don't like you know am i
[SPEAKER_01]: going to edit that out i may argue with
that person and try to you know prove my
[SPEAKER_01]: point or whatever but you know they have
an opinion and uh in a point also so it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean that it's right but you know
we can we can debate that yeah but
[SPEAKER_03]: opinions could be like assholes you know
we all got one and they all stink yeah no
[SPEAKER_01]: some stink more than others you know so uh
yeah you're you're right about that so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know to me just trying to be
transparent and honest and you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: just got to you know operate correctly and
you know everything will you know take its
[SPEAKER_05]: place down the road well there's a reason
why you have had the longevity you've had
[SPEAKER_05]: and i think it's because of that well
people you know you could ask people who
[SPEAKER_01]: know me personally and they'll tell me
they'll tell you who i am you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the people who know me you know
and so your reputation kind of follows you
[SPEAKER_01]: and the longer you're around you know more
people can vouch for you and you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just something that you know over time it
just you know it is what it is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you just try to fucking stay
correct and you know you know and if
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to hate on you then then even
the best who if you're in a public eye it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter who you are if you're a
singer entertainer play sports anything
[SPEAKER_01]: there's someone that hates you so there's
someone that don't like you for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason i don't like their song i don't
like you know i don't like their team i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like this i don't you know so it's
something that you got to live with you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and and if you got a thin skin and
you can't take hate and you know i would
[SPEAKER_01]: say you know being in the public eye is
probably not for you you know because do
[SPEAKER_05]: you think it's do you think it's thin skin
or do you think that it could be caring
[SPEAKER_05]: too much what people think about you
because well that too i mean i used to
[SPEAKER_05]: think i don't think i have thin skin no
but i do care what people think i i do i
[SPEAKER_01]: do too and back in the day it meant
something when you were on the forums you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it really meant something because
that's all you had was what people said
[SPEAKER_01]: about you you know i mean and so you could
be be blackballed out of the community
[SPEAKER_01]: very easily in today's world it's it's
totally different now you know it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's a kind of anything goes you
know we're just scammers and copycats and
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know just keeps going on and on
so you just got to kind of block all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that out and you know you know what's true
and what's not true so when people are
[SPEAKER_01]: saying stuff that's not true about you you
can't let that bother you or show that
[SPEAKER_01]: person that bother you bothers you because
they discontinue they'll just continue on
[SPEAKER_01]: and make it worse you know it feeds the
trolls entertainment yes you know and some
[SPEAKER_01]: for some people that's what their sole
mission on the internet is to do is just
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to you know ruin people because
their their life it sucks themselves so
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to make everyone as miserable as
as they are so
[SPEAKER_05]: oh uh gabby you're muted i said i i really
appreciate you for coming on jj and we
[SPEAKER_05]: could talk for hours more and and we
should we should do it again um i think we
[SPEAKER_05]: probably could do another show of two and
a half three hours and and still not
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch the surface yeah i know there's
just so much there's just so much out
[SPEAKER_05]: there now that you know it's i mean one
thing like you know i do want you to come
[SPEAKER_05]: back because i want to hear the stories
about how you were busted and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: well it's not about glory but it's a it's
still yeah it's something that we had to
[SPEAKER_05]: deal with on a regular if you want to
finish what you were saying and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have anything you want to say about yeah i
mean i i mean it is one of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that you know that that's out
there in existence today you know i'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah matter of opinion you know but the
thing about the 91 it doesn't have no
[SPEAKER_01]: taste to it and i don't think it's not
it's not quite as strong not quite that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what i think it has i don't think the
onion garlicky thing going on how can you
[SPEAKER_05]: say that yeah but i i just want the kem
the 91 taste is what that's kind of a more
[SPEAKER_05]: point desires and and the chem d i agree
that the chem d might be more potent but
[SPEAKER_01]: for me it's all about the i don't know to
me it's a little more bland this again the
[SPEAKER_01]: 91 but i still appreciate it i love it you
know i mean but it's a lot harder to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: to than than the nine the chem d the 91
it's kind of like the the sour diesel it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of finicky and sometimes it can come
out a little bit a little bit different
[SPEAKER_01]: than others but like um like like we've
been growing it it's kind of gotten like
[SPEAKER_01]: this little kind of purpley tip to it
almost now in the in the in the turps that
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming out on it like it it's uh kind
of almost like a little purpley grapey
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little slight tinge in there you
know but um yeah it's funny you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: i think it's kind of changed over the
years a little bit how does the four uh i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean the four was kind of found afterwards
and um so i guess that that uh greg had
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds well i guess he had like 12 or 13
seeds originally then he popped i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how many maybe like half of them or
then he gave um the other four seeds the
[SPEAKER_01]: joe brand and he found the chem one two
three four and i wound up breeding with
[SPEAKER_01]: the the chem four and that was the the one
um that was the best one out of the four
[SPEAKER_01]: and like some people like to think that
it's it's not the same as a chem you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's different than the chem 91 and
chem d and you know they they might have
[SPEAKER_01]: an arguable point there it's kind of hard
to say you know because like the one two
[SPEAKER_01]: three four very all the same and whereas
the 91 is kind of stand on its own and the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem the chem uh d and the chem sister
were alike so there was like almost three
[SPEAKER_01]: different phenotypes in there and so with
the last four being popped last you know
[SPEAKER_01]: there is some controversy of people saying
that it might not be it might have been
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds of the chem or something like that
like a cross of the chem should i say and
[SPEAKER_01]: not the original chem but none of that can
read i mean that story kind of checks out
[SPEAKER_05]: because you know greg had four seeds of
the original ones and then years later
[SPEAKER_01]: more turned up but they said the same
thing about the chem d and not my argument
[SPEAKER_01]: is like because he he popped them in 2005
or six or whatever in the 90 i mean the
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem d and the chem sister are almost
exactly alike other than one being more
[SPEAKER_01]: tiva and the other one being more indiga
but there's no denying that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: sisters okay so you can definitely say
that those are they're the same and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the 91 was in the same pop as the sister
so those two are confirmed right there so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah the last four seeds that were popped
that were totally different from those two
[SPEAKER_01]: i guess you can argue that it could be
that is can we prove it it can never be
[SPEAKER_01]: proven you know but i don't know it's just
one of those yeah i was going to say it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter that one of those things in
cannabis that we'll never know we'll never
[SPEAKER_05]: know right what greg always said was you
muted cosmic what what greg always said
[SPEAKER_05]: was that anything he grows is the chem dog
right okay because he's a chem dog if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were to rank there's three uh right yeah i
would say chem d 91 chem four for me you
[SPEAKER_03]: know i'm growing chem four for the first
time right now so and chem four is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: funny because for me when i grew chem four
it always finished like 60 63 days other
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like i take it to like 77 or
something like that you know and so and
[SPEAKER_01]: even my star dog you know which is pretty
much chem four he's kind of chem four uh
[SPEAKER_01]: chem d arguably afghan but uh all of those
come out finishing pretty much like the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem four you know they're all kind of
kind of short squat uh big buds uh
[SPEAKER_01]: finishes and usually like 63 days and
stuff so um it's you know the chem four
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the the genetics are pretty
dominant on on it you know it kind of has
[SPEAKER_01]: that piney kind of a little bit of
fruitiness to it you know depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype and you know if it leans more
chem d which kind of like the corey star
[SPEAKER_01]: dog does and or the guava which is more
chem four so that was kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in in in that cross there nice
that's very interesting yeah i love all
[SPEAKER_03]: those trains so it's it's so cool to hear
