[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast, a production of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Nick Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, our guest is none other than Dog
Doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find him and his work at Dog
Doctor Official on Instagram, Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Diaries, and on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Dog Doctor, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thank you so much for having
me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an honor and I'm feeling very humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoying the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winter and the rains that we're
waiting for spring to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apart from that, living life in the moment
as most as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like that's how a lot of us
are feeling, just waiting for spring to
[SPEAKER_00]: get here so we can start to plan some
outdoor grows or, you know, I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: for indoor growers, you got to start to
think about a little more heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe heat mitigation and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely, it's an important
time of year for growers in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's new in your grow world,
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, you're always doing
something new in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from every time that I've listened to
you talk about it on like growing with my
[SPEAKER_00]: fellow growers or just chatted with you on
Instagram, you know, you're always doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's new for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the moment, I'm searching for that runs
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost that runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually the one that the photo
that you talked in a few days ago on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two summers ago, I lost her to a heatwave
and the Zamnesia started a contest on grow
[SPEAKER_02]: diaries, which they do a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seeds they were providing for the
contest were nonetheless the Zamnesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to, okay, we have the setup
from Trollmaster now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did one run with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's test the setup now in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm changing a few parameters in there
because it's my second time running under
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy lights and the Spectrum running.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to learn by mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what others do and try to learn by
their mistakes also.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I truly believe that making the
mistakes ourselves, we learn in a
[SPEAKER_02]: different way than seeing others making
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm not chasing the mistakes to
be made, but I know that when growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: when everybody is growing and trying new
things, that mistakes are there to be
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lessons are there to be learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now I'm learning how to Spectrum
tuning and how to manage the inner canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last run, I flipped them into flower and
only at week two, more or less,
[SPEAKER_02]: I connected the inner canopy lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, instead of that, I connected
straight away from the moment I did the 48
[SPEAKER_02]: hours dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do 48 hours dark before flipping into
flower to my understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying this is the best way or the
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my understanding, this helps tricking
the plants into flower modes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that instead of waiting one week
and something for that first three flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: to start showing that are flowering three,
four days only, I already start to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: little bulks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly believe it's that 48 hours
dark that make that happening faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely see a lot of people using
practices like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was really popular for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even seen people in the
commercial space use it because of their
[SPEAKER_00]: belief that it does help trigger the
flowering process sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the end goal is to get as many
different harvests as you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: then starting the flower cycle sooner when
you initiate flower as well, it should
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially bring down the overall
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could see how that could be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really found any success with
it myself, but I think sometimes it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the space, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What works here in my space may not work
in your space or in somebody else's space
[SPEAKER_02]: because all space conditions are
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage everybody to try all methods
that they feel that it's something that
[SPEAKER_02]: they would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, if something doesn't work,
you don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this way, you can find the better way
for yourself, for your space, for your
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, for your needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have more time to be with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other don't have time to be with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just in here, you have to find
different medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, if you want to do cocoa and
do hand water, maybe you need to be with
[SPEAKER_02]: your plants every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a water system, maybe you
don't have to be with your plants every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing soil, it can be more
forgiving because it takes longer to dry
[SPEAKER_02]: also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it retains the water longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every case is a different case.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, home growers, they don't
need to go hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a big facility, I can see why
you do that because of the production and
[SPEAKER_02]: how fast it is and how easy it is to
correct everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something is wrong now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just flush and start again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in one day, plants are again thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are home growing, looking for
better quality, for a better connection
[SPEAKER_02]: with the plants, for all of it,
the soil, it's more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my humble opinion, the flavor in the
end is also better from soil than it is
[SPEAKER_02]: from rock wool and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is a personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is but no.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my experience and from my easy way of
growing, I am with my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day, but still sometimes from time
to time, I don't have time to go there
[SPEAKER_02]: one, two days because life happens and
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil and the auto pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a blast coming in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one that I really, really
appreciate of this, this auto pot system
[SPEAKER_02]: is it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How easy it makes one's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's works on gravity or on density or
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the weight of the water brings it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning even if there is no electricity,
plants will drink as they please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely something that I've seen
a lot of home growers get a lot of success
[SPEAKER_00]: with because it is easy and it makes it so
that you don't have to worry too much
[SPEAKER_00]: about certain aspects of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you are running like some
sort of living soil where you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a certain moisture content for
the biological activity to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, like with hydroponics and
stuff, I would say that maybe the auto pot
[SPEAKER_00]: system isn't the most ideal because you
can't really control a good dry back
[SPEAKER_00]: interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can probably build up salts pretty
quickly too if you're feeding too high
[SPEAKER_00]: with something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's I've seen a lot of people
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't personally tried them out,
but I've always been interested in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But earlier in the conversation,
you started talking about how you are on
[SPEAKER_00]: your second run of under canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a commercial grower, I've been
using it for a little while now and I love
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to find out what your
experience with them has been considering
[SPEAKER_00]: it is kind of one of those things that is
it's still fairly new in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and the home growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people are still fairly
hesitant to jump in to use them because
[SPEAKER_00]: you do increase the heat, you increase
your overall like nutrient consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for the plant, especially
since it's LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, what are some of your
experiences with that off of the first run
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results spoke by themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, once you plug them in,
there's a lot of new factors that need to
[SPEAKER_02]: tune in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heat will go up, meaning that your
humidity needs to go up also because you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to keep your VPD more or less and you
don't need to make the perfect VPD,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you need to keep your numbers close
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, they will be in balance on the
nutrition and then the plants will not go
[SPEAKER_02]: and they will sweat more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything will be more, meaning they will
be needing higher EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you used to work with lower EC and
you're bringing in their canopy lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: trust me, you will have to be make bigger
fittings because there will be more plant
[SPEAKER_02]: mass needing needing food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let's thinking in basics before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking all my light from here,
meaning all my grow is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it's down here, it's not needing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we lollipop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because it would not grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became popcorn and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we have light coming from here
also, meaning that they grow in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they are also growing down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that will require energy that will
require nutrients that will require
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that the tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you it's not doubling everything,
but it's checking and reading the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and see how much they are eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Checking the runoffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do the runoffs in other pots is
difficult, but I have the WCS sensor that
[SPEAKER_02]: tells me what's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know more or less that if I'm feeding
1.5 EC and I'm 1.6 or 1.4, I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: she's eating more or less what I'm feeding
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there I can give her help more or
less and see if she's building up and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: giving her more, but she's not eating
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers are going more are
accumulating there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I control my runoffs in the
outer pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not doing outer pots, I just I
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the EC that goes in is 1.5 and the one
coming out is 1, she needs more food.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the EC that goes in is 1.5 and the one
coming out it's 2.0, she needs less food
[SPEAKER_02]: or just water for the next one or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how I balance or I try to
balance the best I can the nutrition into
[SPEAKER_02]: my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you always try to keep somewhat of a
consistent level of poor water EC rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than having it do any sort of like
generative steering towards a higher EC at
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning of flower and then reducing
it towards the bulking period or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less, I start increasing my EC in
veg until flower and then in flower I
[SPEAKER_02]: again increase it with the peas and the
case and all the extra boosters that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are giving them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This if I'm doing in an organic way or
organic on mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm just doing minerals, which I am
doing now with the Trollmaster,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing the Aptus All and Clean program,
which is just minerals, no organic stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This brings higher ECs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But plants seem to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I was doing 0.8 in veg,
now I'm doing 1.3 in veg and I start
[SPEAKER_02]: flower with 1.5 and I finish around 2.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: This last year for me was unthinkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not understand how people would go
with EC so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I understand it's everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if you go and train into a gym
full of oxygen and the best conditions you
[SPEAKER_02]: will need more minerals, more vitamins,
more to keep up your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are, I believe that they work the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my opinion, they don't care if it's
organic, mineral, synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant itself needs NPK, macro,
micronutrients and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you provide them in Y, X or whatever
form that you prefer to you, they will
[SPEAKER_02]: receive it and they will thank you for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end product, honestly, I also believe
that it's raw talk and it's our way of
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking that makes us believe that
organic is better than synthetic or
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, if I give you a really
good flower, synthetic, organic or
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral, well-cured, well-proper,
you most will not know the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that it's undisputable,
but you will not know unless you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we as growers, we know when I grow for
myself, so I like the organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The organic and the mineral, I don't go
synthetics myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always found that the best flower
that I could ever grow at home was either
[SPEAKER_00]: in a really large living soil pot,
like a 30-gallon pot or better,
[SPEAKER_00]: or using cocoa coir and just a really
basic Jax 321 or JR CropTech or any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these salt-based fertilizers that have all
the macro and micros in one side and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen and calcium in another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mix those up either in equal
parts or depending on the formula,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever ratio it is, and then adding some
biology to the substrate like an earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: casting tea or just any other microbiology
that you can get in there to help initiate
[SPEAKER_00]: those responses in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the chitin response pathways,
and then there's the salicylic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways that can be triggered if the
plant comes in contact with them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I've always experienced is that
it tends to produce a more robust
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it in the hydroponic
setting because then you get the speed of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the potential for a greater
yield if you have the correct irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental practices in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of instances, sometimes I think
of all that microbial activity in living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have any sporulation events
where you have mushrooms that are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: or other fungus that's growing and you get
all those spores up into the plant matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: then a lot of that, there are potential
for mycotoxins and stuff like that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're combusting cannabis, but some of
them are also destroyed by combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always just went with the, I want to
keep it a little bit cleaner, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to throw a little bit of some sort of
microbial activity in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I had to stop growing at home,
I wanted to do those in auto pots because
[SPEAKER_00]: you do get that benefit of the constant
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also feed through it as well,
like you're saying at a lower EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeding higher ECs now also.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the whole system, the pipes were a
little bit too thin and if you put too
[SPEAKER_02]: much stuff in there, it would build up
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The organic would just not work very nice
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the new lines, the blue lines,
black, whatever color you get,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are pipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you put in there, organic or
not, it will go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, after one, you need to clean it
up, but this is normal procedure that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do with any system, hydroponic or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to avoid problems,
you have to keep it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go clean from run to run and keep it
cleaning if needed during the run.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the things that people
don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think that it's not important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just one run or no, it's very
important every run to set up to zero in
[SPEAKER_02]: my humble opinion, because you don't want
to bring any issue that it was not present
[SPEAKER_02]: in the previous run, but it was starting
to be present, but it was a late present,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you did not see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you start this one, but it's
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like mildew mold and stuff,
it stays there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spores, man, I unionize.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I unionize my tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bleach it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I clean it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, I have a unionizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put this in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this does is this divides the
oxygen molecule in two and this kills
[SPEAKER_02]: everything inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacteria, non-bacteria, mold, mildew,
whatever spore you have in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like an ozone generator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you cannot read it, but I close the
tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put the lights on so that it's very hot
inside it or the hotter I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I leave it there for half an hour and in
four by four, it's more than enough.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's commercial facilities that
use thermal protocols when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning their rooms and they'll like
maintain a certain temperature for a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frame and it will help destroy any sort of
biology that's still in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have UV something, UVC that they're
using to kill bugs and stuff and mold and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it's UVC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm speaking by head, but facilities are
using and now home growers are using it
[SPEAKER_02]: also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Future of Grow, which is a brand of from
Swiss just released it and Grandmaster
[SPEAKER_02]: Level also did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a UU and it's something that you just
run off an hour on the grow and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to kill nets, trips and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not try it, but I'm very curious
about the predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you know, there are so many
new technologies that are kind of popping
[SPEAKER_00]: up that are either like a light based pest
prevention and then you also have that
[SPEAKER_00]: ozone generator, which is nothing new,
but I've definitely started to see people
[SPEAKER_00]: use it more often because it is a very
effective tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a crazy new tool and the people are
using it and I'm curious to bring it into
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow actually and to see because trips
and nets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that in the beginning,
I was paranoid when I was growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockwall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything needs to be sterilized and this
and that and over the years, when I moved
[SPEAKER_02]: myself to soil and completely to soil and
in organics, I start to understand that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's normal for us to have bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're part of the nature, so I came to
accept them, but we need to control them
[SPEAKER_02]: and what I do to control it's a nematodes,
it's a bunch of predators and this and
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that you keep and you need
to keep buying and getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can get now a lamp that I place it in
the tent and half an hour a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: I run it and this will do the exact same
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's intriguing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about machines with lasers on big
facilities that go with AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: They identify the trip and the pest and
they just killed that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my dad was just talking about that
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I've seen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's still in the process of
being perfected though, because if that
[SPEAKER_00]: was so efficient, drones are pretty cheap
nowadays and lasers aren't necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: most advanced technology and with the AI
learning and stuff, it doesn't seem like
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be excessively cost prohibitive
where almost any commercial facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can just buy something like that
rather than spray stuff and because the
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays, those are all consumables,
so you have to continuously purchase them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not the cheapest, especially
when you get into some of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries that you might be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it did work, I feel like we would see
it a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still kind of hesitant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it work or is it something that's
still in the process of being developed
[SPEAKER_00]: and perfected?
[SPEAKER_00]: On paper it does sound amazing.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad we kind of had this little
ramble here to start off the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to kind of steer us back
into some of the questions that I have for
[SPEAKER_02]: us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to find out where your
journey with plants started and whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: was with cannabis or if you grew up in a
household that had like a vegetable garden
[SPEAKER_00]: or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what were your first experiences with
plants and what led you into where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: today with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my family, the farmers also,
I have farmers in the family, but I was a
[SPEAKER_02]: city boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was raised in a city, going to the farm
and raised into the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always had contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was that kid that when people ask what a
tomato is or an apple or a carrot or where
[SPEAKER_02]: does the meat came from, I knew for me it
was normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that the meat is from the cow and
that they kill the pig and the chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was always something that was very
into my blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still is, I believe, and still is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis came to me, weed came to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start smoking very early, about 13,
something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at 15, more or less, one seed came in
the traditional.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is the cliche story,
but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came with seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put the seed in soil and bam,
it grows something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK, it's this easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going up and down and we
start looking for seeds and things and
[SPEAKER_02]: time passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about, let's say, so it's still in the
past about a few decades ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started growing for myself, seriously,
like, OK, I'm sick of everybody else's
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each time I grow a plant, mini plant,
big plant, it's always better than
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that I buy commercially.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least to me, it sounds better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if it is or not, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I started, one thing led to the
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a few decades now that I am
kind of engaged with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I travel, I have to have somebody
taking care of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That somebody needs to be somebody from my
family because I don't talk with nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: else where I am about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody really knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this for decades and a
handful of people knows because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: situations that we live in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it became like tomatoes or like
anything else, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to care for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I think that I'm doing anything
wrong, but they think it is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're living by their rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing led to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in about the 2000s, I start
becoming really serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start investing in whatever and
researching and not just growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to understand what I grow,
what are the genetics, why this genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: does this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why that does that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing led to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: This always was a solo journey for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then COVID hits and everybody stays home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly everything is going bananas and
I'm home or what I do home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get to even more deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start researching like studying more or
less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I start going online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing that for me was no,
I never did forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did anything because man,
why would I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started going online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a few channels on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, I found the Let's Be Buds
and I found the GML.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started getting leds at that time was
the first time I get leds before it was
[SPEAKER_02]: all HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the days I decided to,
GML was saying, if you guys want to come
[SPEAKER_02]: in and ask questions and man, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say my first time growing leds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I met Spartan and my lead
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then from there, I start following him and
I follow my fellow home grows and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was how I began to go online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since this was happening, I decided,
okay, so let's make an Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I don't share any photos,
I can follow other people specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: because I cannot do this with my private
account because of the paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I created an account on Instagram and
one thing led to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time start passing and about a year after
I had my Instagram accounts up to all and
[SPEAKER_02]: came to me and asked me why I did not do
any posts because I was talking to them in
[SPEAKER_02]: history stories and stuff like that
because that was the nutrient line that I
[SPEAKER_02]: was using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told me, well, if you start posting
some photos or some content the same way
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing on your stories, you don't
need to do anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can sponsor you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I realized, okay,
there might be something else more here
[SPEAKER_02]: than just me growing and this passion can
actually turn into something bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started to post online.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was about three years ago,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one thing led to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, everything is happening so
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm feeling very humbled and blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not blessed because I don't like the word
blessed because it's be less and I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: be more and I want everybody to be more,
not less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel very, very grateful with how
things are coming because there's podcasts
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Instagram account is going up and I
love to talk about these plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when people come to me and tell me
something that I did wrong because I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't know I did it wrong and I learned
from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love to help people when I see and I
know many take this as a personal thing
[SPEAKER_02]: and oh, I'm not criticizing you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving you the way I do things and the
community is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the YouTube is also growing a new
community that I was not expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Videos are coming out and I'm loving this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bringing me even more closer to
the plants that I was before because now
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not just being there, looking at the
plant, taking care of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when I'm filming, when I'm looking for
details, I'm seeing things that I never
[SPEAKER_02]: saw before and I'm noticing things in the
way that plants grows, in the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything evolves, especially when you
make a timelapse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see how they move, how they grow,
how they spin, everything a plant does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just this, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's moving all day around and changing
forms and goes and came.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alive, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm loving this creating continent and
creating things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's obvious you have a lot of
passion for the plant and there's like an
[SPEAKER_00]: art form, I feel like to a lot of the
content that you do show where it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just a picture of a plant or some
impressive yield or a bag full of awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: looking flowers or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of the grow itself and how
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things that you like
to do in your garden that you might think
[SPEAKER_00]: are unique to your situation that other
people might not know about how you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending if I'm growing out of flowers or
if I'm growing normal plants, not normal,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all normal, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm growing feminized or regular seeds,
I grow different.
[SPEAKER_02]: For out of flowers, for instance,
I don't top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people like topping or not topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't top not because I don't top,
it's just because I don't like to touch
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the out of flowers as something that
you grow and it's not there to give you
[SPEAKER_02]: more work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just there to assist you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do with out of flowers is I leaf
bend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only leaf bend them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I start only leaf bend them,
they start to grow way more and bigger and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting big, big, big out of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like this leaf bending on the out
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean by leaf bending?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: so plants, they grow and then the leaf,
a new leaf came here that is covering the
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see this now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is covering the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do, I grab this leaf and I put
it under the one that is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like leaf tucking is another one that I've
heard people use for that where they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tuck the leaves under the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will bring the nodes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves are still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not defoliating.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will grow under it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this helps out of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my experience, it helps out of
flowers grow more even canopy without
[SPEAKER_02]: being that tree that everybody likes and
it's a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have this top up here getting
a thousand people PPFD and have this one
[SPEAKER_02]: down here getting three hundreds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This helps plants grow more or less all
the same size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the canopy from one plant will be
spearing the same PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any like bending of the tip of
the plant where you like will bend the top
[SPEAKER_00]: down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you say you don't top it,
but sometimes I've seen people they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of like bend it over lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not on out of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: On out of flowers, I think that I believe
that high stress trainings in out of
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers is it's going to result in less
weight, not quality, but in not so many
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because an out of flower, she's doing what
the fuck she wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's on her on her roads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you do to her, she's on her room.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you stress her, she will take time as
other plants have to bounce back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that time that she's bouncing back,
it's not it's not on hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeps going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning her veg time keeps going or her
flower time keeps going.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end, that stress, it's something
that it did not make you more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running feminized or regular
seeds, you can stress a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wait for her to bounce back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stress her again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when she's okay, you flip it to
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of flowers, they will run whatever
they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they want to flip to flower,
they will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my humble opinion, out of flowers,
we are there to assist them.
[SPEAKER_02]: On their needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by looking at them, by leaf bending,
whatever techniques you like to use it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just there to exist, not to stress
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any up potting when you grow out
of flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people will heavily push back
against doing up pots, but I always found
[SPEAKER_00]: that it worked really well for out of
flowers, as long as you didn't damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots when you were transplanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three up pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to put mycorrhizal in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I don't do transplants,
I cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I either use the promix soil, which has
the mycorrhizal already in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I still like to gently see the roots
and give a spring lecture of mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_02]: in there and then put it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really see the roots bouncing big
and they say bigger roots, bigger fruits,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not always the case if you're
growing hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have big fruits in small cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I grow soil, so bigger roots in soil
makes bigger fruits and the mycorrhizal,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a really amazing fungi, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The network it creates there, the uptaking
of the nutrients, it also helps breaking
[SPEAKER_02]: things in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants get more susceptible, they get
stronger also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you complement this with,
for instance, monosilica, we'll get a
[SPEAKER_02]: structure on their cells thicker,
we'll get them stronger, we'll create
[SPEAKER_02]: little layers that get everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh, you don't need this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is just a tiny little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, it's 2% from this
monosilica, 2% from the mycorrhizal,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end, it's this much percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's on the overall results,
to my experience, makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely in a living soil situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What mycorrhizal fungi do you like to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: I only use Aptos for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I converted myself to Aptos five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then three years ago, I get sponsored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly don't see myself going back
to anything else because I see this as a
[SPEAKER_02]: marriage.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you find a good woman, I know there's
more good women in the world, but why
[SPEAKER_02]: would I be looking at them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I be curious about them?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have my wife, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see the nutrients and my relation
with Aptos like that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, and this is really my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a believer before being sponsored
and I keep being a believer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a concentrated product, meaning I'm
not buying water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the bottles that you get in the
market on the labels, I'm not saying they
[SPEAKER_02]: are better or worse, but the percentage of
water comparing to the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's much bigger, meaning you have to buy
many more times.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the super concentrated, man,
you use tiny little beads.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was paying more for the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but if they were going triple the
time that other labels were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, it was not more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have one thing that for me,
it's crucial in any grow, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulator, which is for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have there is a facilitator on
the Aptos and you have something similar,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a power side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically it's monosilica, which is active
and ready for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not silica, but because silica goes
in the soil, needs to break down,
[SPEAKER_02]: takes time to get available to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good, but it takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The monosilica formula, it's straight away
available for the plant, meaning that she
[SPEAKER_02]: will drink it straight away and straight
away she will feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like taking, I don't know,
steroids, you feel straight away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that it is steroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the first thing that goes in my
reservoir, always, always.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should be the first thing in any
reservoir because nutrients, they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: go in an order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're too paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try and put the silica after you put the
CalMac and tell me what you see in the
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to get
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other way around and you get a clean
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this means that there's a chemical
reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything needs to go in an order.
[SPEAKER_02]: First goes monosilica, then goes whatever
the rest of your line is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, um, I've experienced like,
uh, mixing something in the wrong order
[SPEAKER_00]: before and just learned from that
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of them was I was making,
uh, I was using potassium silicate to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a solution for a pH down or an alkalizer
for my, um, my nutrient water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I added a bunch of, um, sulfuric acid
to the, um, potassium silicate because we
[SPEAKER_00]: had, uh, I think we just had some like
acid spill or something and we needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used the alkalizer to counteract
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned into a gel because the
silica turned into silicon and it,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and it turned into that actual,
like it had that chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, that's, that's a huge
precipitation event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would cause such major clogging
if anything like that were to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: through some sort of irrigation line or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you wouldn't be mixing bases and
acids in an irrigation line, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, but how important it is and how
chemical everything it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's like, uh, this by itself,
it's nothing, this by itself, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing, this by itself, it's a bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the concentration of of those
different, um, constituents when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing them in solution is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like another example that I've,
I've had is I was, we, I would use,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride
when I would flush the plants at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of a cycle, um, for just a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to maintain the high,
uh, calcium levels as well as magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's in a cocoa substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just other, there's other
reasons why there, but, um, to make a long
[SPEAKER_00]: story short, you know, I would mix them in
individually and I was like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: why can't I mix these together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out, well, because it makes
calcium sulfate when you mix magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate with calcium chloride and calcium
sulfate is, uh, it, it just precipitates
[SPEAKER_00]: out of solution instantly almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get this huge layer of,
uh, like calcium sulfate dust at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, uh, gypsum basically at the bottom
of the, um, of the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different things like that are really
interesting to, to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see something so drastic,
like one of the two examples I gave,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do realize that it is important even
in smaller amounts to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's mixed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, especially when you do start to play
with higher ECs, I don't know about like
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.0 to 2.5, but if you start to get up to
like three to four, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely start to see different,
uh, chemical reactions take place if
[SPEAKER_00]: things are mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the wrong order.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's still, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might, I might get there with the under
canopy lights with turning in and with
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now 2.4, 2.5 was the highest I
went last run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the highest I went ever on
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use a supplemental CO2?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I have, um, the heater on the
house is gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are in winter time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the most time that, that turning,
just having the heater on, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's enough to bring the numbers
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's me, my family and the dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I, I build this in a way that the
whole circulation from the house came
[SPEAKER_02]: straight into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that all that we breed doesn't go
out the other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other ways are to bring Henry in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always get the minimum 600,
700 PPMs in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the heater is on, it goes up to one
five to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're happy with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Oh, that's too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can take it up to three and four and
five and PPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not perfect for them, but they can
handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the, Oh, you're giving them 1200
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go and take your measurement outside,
middle of the day in the sun and tell me
[SPEAKER_02]: what you read.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go up to five, six, seven,
depending on where you are in the world.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and also if you are having higher
than ambient levels of CO2, then the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can definitely photosynthesize at a
higher rate where that's, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to really be bothered by a higher,
a higher light level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, that's,
that's also where a higher EC of feed can
[SPEAKER_00]: come into play and be handy because you
will have just a higher overall
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation rate of nutrients into the
tissue of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a lot more of a
dense nutrient package in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you do have those
parameters, don't be worried about getting
[SPEAKER_00]: up in your EC, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, I've been running lately,
but it is with supplemental CO2 at 1500
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million throughout all the light
cycles and a high PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been feeding at 4.5 EC and it works
really well, but you have to have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: clean nutrient to be able to run it like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think you would be able to get
away with that in an autopot system
[SPEAKER_00]: because you do need some level of drain to
waste where your, your runoff is pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: off that extra salt buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the high level of nutrients that
are available in the correct ratios at
[SPEAKER_00]: that EC, you can see tremendous bud growth
and overall plant health with a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: a really well dialed in environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you can do it because facilities
are doing it and you look at whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: they're doing and it looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not doing soil, they'll doing
rock wool or cocoa or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, what you're saying of the buildups
because on the autopot, you don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: dry outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's myself that I close the pipes and I
let it go for dry outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I want to do top feeding on
something, but the aqua valve,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that that thing works is yes,
it's kind of like a, it has one,
[SPEAKER_02]: one, one rubber here and one rubber down
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When this rubber hits down here,
it's a, this one releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when this comes in here, this one
releases meaning the plants get the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: the valves go like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she drinks the water, this can down
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it's on it, it opens,
it releases again, it will fool again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, but the soil is always wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's always, I don't know the
exact percentage, but there's always at
[SPEAKER_02]: least 10, 15% moist in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for living soil, it's great for soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how this worked with cocoa
because I did not do cocoa in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using substrate monitoring,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing the water content and the
electrical conductivity within the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you have that data
available, it really opens up your eyes to
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in the root zone and you
can see more clearly as to how the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is interacting with the nutrients that
you're providing it, as well as the water
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're providing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people do get scared running
higher ECs because they think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: building up in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't see what's in there,
then the only way you're going to tell if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are building up, you know,
things that you don't want in there is if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing like a saturated pace test,
or if you're sending off your substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: for analysis, or if you're running runoff
checks where you're gathering runoff data
[SPEAKER_00]: through EC and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you have all that information,
then it's really hard to tell what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, unless you do have this
substrate monitoring tool where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: follow a graph, basically, and it shows
you the highs and the lows and the trends
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see if it's been slowly
raising up or slowly going down or staying
[SPEAKER_00]: steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can make a lot of educated changes
to what your inputs are based on that
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate because so many of
those substrate monitoring tools are
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, yeah, to anybody
who's just listening, he's showing us his
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate monitoring just right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's yeah, it's it's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's information that you can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using like a
Trollmaster substrate monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of their WCS monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like really great pieces of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a lot of cases, you know,
they're really expensive to get even just
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the piece of equipment
like the single item.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Blue Labs has one that is just the
item.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out now, there's Blue Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good ones is the Blue Labs and the
Trollmaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now Mars Hydro, it's done one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider Farm, it's done one.
[SPEAKER_02]: AC Infinity also did one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go Amazon and you look online,
there's a lot, a lot, a lot of them from
[SPEAKER_02]: China, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how good or bad they work,
but there's a lot of options, meaning that
[SPEAKER_02]: sooner or later, both Trollmaster and all
the expensive labels, they are not
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just better construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's normal that it's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't pay the same for a Maserati that
you pay for a Renaults or for a Ford.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things get different prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Aroya for our monitoring at the
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did come out with like the Aroya
Go platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even still, you know, the startup
price was like $1,500 or $2,000 US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came with like a two-year
subscription to being able to store your
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, you would have to pay a
monthly fee in order to maintain access to
[SPEAKER_00]: all the data that they're providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole subscription service and not
being able to just have that data based on
[SPEAKER_00]: you purchasing the equipment right there
and then just like using it locally,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even necessarily like trying to use
any of the other services that they
[SPEAKER_00]: provide, you still would have to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can just become even more cost
prohibitive in a lot of ways for people
[SPEAKER_00]: because like even with some of the other
shows that you've interacted with in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, like the cheap home grow,
you know, growing with my fellow growers
[SPEAKER_00]: show, the whole point of that show is to
help people grow cheaply because cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is really expensive when you're going and
buying it at a dispensary in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, anywhere else that does have
access to either a recreational or medical
[SPEAKER_00]: market, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow it for so much cheaper at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, a lot of people do struggle
early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, when you don't know and
you think you need more than you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that you need, it's very easy for a grow
to become super expensive with the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you buy and that you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then with overtime experience,
you're starting to realize that what you
[SPEAKER_02]: need and what you don't need, and it
becomes more cost effective and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still not a cheap hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a cheap hobby, especially if
you're passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always something new coming out
and you want to try this and see that and
[SPEAKER_02]: that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like cars, they buy cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people, when you like this,
you will go for the gadgets here,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the controllers, for the little things
that do you need them?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't need them to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they will help your journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to be better than nature,
which we will never be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's our goal is to be better than
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be better than nature, which is
impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can be better than God.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just my opinion, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we go with best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try the lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try the extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we trying to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mimic God.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to do what he does on the
perfect way inside here with controls and
[SPEAKER_02]: with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that takes money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun hobby, but it's an expensive
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, when you're an adult,
any hobby that you have, it's an expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you like, it's going to be
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you have some sort of
passion or real desire to want to learn as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as you can within that hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll drain your wallet in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been growing for, you said,
over 20 years now?
[SPEAKER_00]: More.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than two decades now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the ideas in mind of what we were
just talking about with new growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's sometimes difficult for a new
grower when they're starting off,
[SPEAKER_00]: how long did it take you to achieve your
first harvest that you were extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: proud about?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody ever did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one got me thinking, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, when I look back now,
I'm really only happy, happy with what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: growing now for the past decade,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not even that, because before that
was a passion, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was better than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I see what I grow now,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what I grew last year and I see how
I grow now and I see difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's me growing better,
if it's the me tuning in things better,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's the everything else in conjunction
that makes it, but it looks better,
[SPEAKER_02]: it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really proud of what I smoke now,
but I was super proud of what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we grow and we evolve in the
same way when we, somebody would come to
[SPEAKER_02]: you with weed and you were just a teenager
and you will grab it raw and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now when the friend comes to you with
weed, analyzing it and put it almost under
[SPEAKER_02]: the microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot that you have to talk
about that weed before it was just weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we ourselves also evolve into
someone different that is more picky,
[SPEAKER_02]: more existent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to express it with,
with everything, which lead us to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: better, to, to charge for terpenes,
something that 10 years ago, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, yes, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what it was terpenes, but I would
not growing for terpenes for the past
[SPEAKER_02]: decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about potency, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I don't want to be smoking and
not feeling anything, but I care about the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all of the experience from the moment
that I opened my jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the moment I open the groove bag and
I take that first aroma that comes in my
[SPEAKER_02]: nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I grab it, when I look at
it, when I break it down, when I roll it
[SPEAKER_02]: and I smoke it and I like to do all of it,
I don't like to do the cones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, when you do your first dry puff
and it tastes the same as the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's already whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are only defending you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you smoke and then you get that
third profile coming into you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something else different comes
completely different outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mind keeps blowing.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I love the passion behind what you're
saying there because it makes me think of
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who is an educated consumer versus
an uneducated consumer.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, with, with like the U S market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this issue where everything is
based on and I know that that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, something that's widespread just
across the, the world of consumers with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that there is the ability to test for
and that it's the largest constituent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids typically that that's the
number that people are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that they have access to testing,
people are interested in that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're saying, I want something
with a lot of and a lot of and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily even there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking, Oh, what have I had in the
past that has worked really well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going for the, you know,
the most and it's, it's really odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's almost like, uh, the term that
comes to mind is the tyranny of numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: where because we can test for it,
people now use that as the, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the qualifier for what is good versus
experiencing something, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, wow, I really like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at, you know,
what it, what's in it so that you can try
[SPEAKER_00]: to find that elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's, it's not necessarily
driven off of an experience based thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's driven off of a perception of what
they should, what they want to experience
[SPEAKER_00]: based on some weird number system,
uh, that we've, it's, it's unfortunate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and they also, I think in the,
in general, with right now, it's way
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger than it was 20 years ago with the
breathings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did everything, which is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably, if I would smoke the same way
that I would smoke 20 years ago right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: it probably wouldn't do anything to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, on this process, they're losing a
lot of things like the CBD 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have the balance of THC,
the balance of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the terpins and
everything else right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's zero CBD there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big number on THC and now the
terpins are coming in lower numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's three, five, 10% or something like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the highest it goes on the terpins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it's really low numbers
and people are looking for that with the
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better, bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better, bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the balance that it makes it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be really low, maybe 10% THC,
but those 5% terpins in there will make
[SPEAKER_02]: you experience that by itself,
the high will be much more pleasurable and
[SPEAKER_02]: last longing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that I know that's from
old weed, I like to call it like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old weed, like the old skank, the old
super skanks and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would last for, they would last,
I don't know, for two hours, three hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you would get that trippy feeling from
the medicine for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the new weed, you may get that,
but it's 10 minutes peak, 15 minutes peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you need to smoke again to keep
that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, I don't know if this is also
because we are now- It might just be
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our tolerance also may not help to this,
but still I do a break for a week on
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I smoke again, I feel it's right
away, but it's not that two hours that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to think about rolling another
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: After 45 minutes, I'm already thinking
about rolling another one and another one
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this was the breeding out of
everything to put in the THC numbers in it
[SPEAKER_02]: that, I don't know, this is just me
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's definitely a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I've talked about
before on the show is that there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: more availability of different genetics,
all of which are going to have different
[SPEAKER_00]: THC overall cannabinoid and terpene
profiles, as well as whatever other
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile organic compounds are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And due to the fact that we all have
unique endocannabinoid systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're sifting through a million
different strains to try and find the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: or the twos that work for you,
then that's going to be a lot harder than
[SPEAKER_00]: sifting through the five or 10 strains
available in your local area at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I know that there is a lot more
available, but not necessarily at the
[SPEAKER_00]: level that we have now due to the more
popularization of cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide that we've been able to see
through the different legal and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational markets that have come
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opened up just so much more access to
information, strains, cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trading of genetics, whether it be
seed stock or clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with tissue culture, the ability
to transfer a lot of those different
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics worldwide with ease and not risk
exposure or incrimination due to those
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of what we can do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It opens up so much more availability for
different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the benefit of it where if you
find something that really works for you
[SPEAKER_00]: now, like you might be able to find
something that works so well for you now
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may not have ever been able to
find before because it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the sifting of getting through all
those different strains now is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take so much longer that it almost seems
impossible to actually find that super
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unicorns are getting more unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unicorns are becoming harder to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's way more options to look for it,
but there's way less unicorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you really see all the options kind
of came from the same parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then they crossed it and
recrossed it and read this, this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you go to the base, there's
Northern Lights, there's Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's Afghani, there's distance deaths.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from this, the crosses with those 10,
maybe 10, maybe 20, there are thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: that were born right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with legalization hitting all over the
world, as you were saying, more people
[SPEAKER_02]: also is playing and which is great,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a beautiful thing because
otherwise the plant would not evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tissue culture, you were talking,
it's something that really fascinated me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never went too deep of it, but the fact
that you can preserve the exact same thing
[SPEAKER_02]: without any pathogens, without anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little thing like this for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can grow the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's AI also involved in seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: AI can identify the seed, male or female.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is huge because I don't know if this
is something that will come up or not
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a big market for feminized
seeds around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But supposedly feminized seeds are weaker
seeds than regular seeds, they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the regular seeds take out the male
problem, which is for the home grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy 10 seeds, regular, and then I have
eight males.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a problem for a home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a facility that you're
searching, okay, this goes, this keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for now, I'm growing the Menta de
Croco from Derpy Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mutant plant and it was 12 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the 12, I have five females.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the rest was to kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind if I'm losing time because I
like what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I only have a closet, like a four
by four or something, and this is my grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I put 10 plants in there, it's because
I want the 10 plants out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if I put five in there, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if with AI, we can identify that this
seed is female, exactly 100%, this is
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to see that to believe it because
there's... Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be huge if it were
something that an AI software could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am very skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to see that happen with a proven
regular pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can send you a few articles on it after.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's with pleasure and you can look for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that it's been talking
about only for the past few months,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I only realized about it a few
months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if this really is true, and if this
really goes forward with it, I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: why seed companies would not do this to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a big market for feminize,
but dude, you're selling feminizers
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just regular that you assure that
it's a feminize.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what the future has for us on
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works, it works, but I'm definitely
trepidatious to...
[SPEAKER_00]: To be like, oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the laser for the bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have a mini drone like
this big going in my tent killing bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but just set it off for five minutes
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the biggest setbacks that
you faced as a grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering a lot of people that listen to
this are home growers themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone faces different problems within
their grow, but we all have to learn to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bounce back from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those setbacks that
you've had to bounce back from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, the biggest one that I struggle
with, still even with decades of growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I sometimes struggle with it is patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're growing, I think this is the
biggest thing on growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be patient for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning with the water,
especially if you are a new grower and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of things happening and you
want to do everything because everything
[SPEAKER_02]: is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the beginning, you over water then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you realize you over water and then
you will be under watering then.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all the process for you to learn
and for people to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I honestly believe that the biggest
setback that we have is ourselves with the
[SPEAKER_02]: hurry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hurry to water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hurry to trim, to defoliate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hurry to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dudes, if you are months and months
and months, not months and months,
[SPEAKER_02]: but three, four months surrounding a plant
or grow or whatever, and then in the end
[SPEAKER_02]: you harvested too soon, you're losing
potential and you're losing weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my humble opinion, you're losing
three or four months of work because this
[SPEAKER_02]: is not the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, I don't know if this was the
one where you were looking back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think patience and it's the biggest
thing that we as growers need to learn and
[SPEAKER_02]: to accept and to embrace that planting is
believing in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So believe in it because it will take
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same as a potato or a strawberry
or whatever you're putting on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will take time to grow and you cannot
rush nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great sentiment to
deliver to other growers is patience is
[SPEAKER_00]: key.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one of the fastest growing crops
growing for us either in our home grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor setting or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we don't need that much
patience with cannabis because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have from seed to the pipe or bowl or
whatever it is that you're using to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: that final product with, yeah,
four months maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of other plants that you
can say, hey, I'm planting this apple tree
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to eat an apple in four
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I feel like be appreciative
for the fact that it grows so fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but learn a little bit of patience is a
definite good thing to relay to other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see people harvesting still too soon
and sometimes giving it those extra few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, it just makes for such a different
product in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that wasn't necessarily
what I was thinking about when I asked the
[SPEAKER_00]: question of biggest setbacks, but maybe a
better way to phrase it is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I like to ask growers is what
are some of the biggest or like what is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson that you've learned from a failure
in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what is the lesson that you've
learned from a success in your garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lesson from... Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, failures, over watering, it's really
bad for you because you will stuck your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's worse to over water than to
under water for the single reason that a
[SPEAKER_02]: dry plant, it will look almost dead,
but if you give it water to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will bounce back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over water plants will have problems
on uptaking nutrients, will have problems
[SPEAKER_02]: on root raw, will have problems in a lot
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, over watering is definitely a big,
big, big thing, a big lesson in the garden
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's something that it takes time,
takes time to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either it by weight on the pot,
this is something that when I was not
[SPEAKER_02]: doing automatic watering without a pot,
I was something that I found myself doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how much it is without watering,
now I water, I know how much it is and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I will look for that same weight for
me to water again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was how I myself fight the over
watering because in the beginning I was
[SPEAKER_02]: over watering, especially in the first
years, everything was just water,
[SPEAKER_02]: water, water, water, water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would go with water, water,
water, water and the same plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: they drink a lot and they don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if the water goes away,
it doesn't stay in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of them, they don't like over
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will get stuck on growth,
they will get stuck on eating,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will get stuck on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is one of the biggest lessons
for me in growing is the waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost falls in line with patience,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you first start growing,
you're like, I got to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has water and rather than being
patient and allowing for it to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: water that it already has to a certain
level so that you don't create anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: or hypoxic conditions in the root zone and
cause these different root health issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: having that patience to wait for that dry
back, make sure that it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see a lot of growers where they're
just like, I got to make sure that I get
[SPEAKER_00]: that water on there like right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stop rushing the waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually prefer to get into the room and
see them like kind of dripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I forget to water for two,
three days if I need to water because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: never that time that longer away from them
than to be to finding them dripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lessons learned when mistakes were making,
I don't know, super crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned myself from mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was super cropping until
later on because super cropping happened
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're working and you break it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then suddenly that broken branch
becomes the best fruit in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was how I learned myself about super
cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to implement this a few decades
ago without reading or seeing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know it's super cropping,
but this all began with me breaking
[SPEAKER_02]: branches and that branch making the best
buds in the whole tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: This may be or may not be, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start breaking them for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I go there, I gently, I super crop
them if they go too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one was a mistake that took me to
a lesson and one that I use still today
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's been a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know the names and the techniques
for them, but this is how I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious about the new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, it's something that I need to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to find time and courage to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it happened to me two times and on
the two times that it happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will explain in a second, I believe that
plants grew better.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has this big paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the little top root from the seed,
the first one, cannot be touched,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannot be broken, cannot be nothing
because it's very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two times that I broke it in half and
I still put it in the soil, plants grew
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing compared to the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want to do, this is probably
something that I will be doing maybe on
[SPEAKER_02]: the next run, on a few couple of runs,
is I'm going to do 10 seeds and I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to purposely cut five of them in half,
the tiny roots and the other five,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to leave it normal and I'm going
to plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to see if the five that I cut
the roots in half, the mini top root in
[SPEAKER_02]: half, will all grow better than the other
five.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that happens, then I will know for sure
that this was just not a casual thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened because the two times that this
happened and I realized it happened
[SPEAKER_02]: because when I grabbed the seed,
the half of the roots just took there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still put it in soil, they grew amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to do this test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me think of root pruning with
bonsais where you have the bonsai in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small pot where the roots are constricted
to a certain amount of substrate and then
[SPEAKER_00]: periodically you go in and you trim off
the extra roots, add some fresh substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it back in there and you get this
explosive growth for the next amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even helped other growers where they
have limited space and they have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: all their moms in like a one gallon pot or
something along those lines so they'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: every few months, if they don't have the
ability to clone it right then or if they
[SPEAKER_00]: let it go too long so it's root bound and
you don't have really good healthy growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go in, you pull the root ball out of
the pot, you shave a quarter to half inch
[SPEAKER_00]: off of all the different sides with like a
bread knife or something and then you just
[SPEAKER_00]: put fresh substrate in there and put it
back in and you get that new root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: from the root pruning and you get healthy
new upper growth and you can take a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can reset it and that's also
what works or why fabric pots tend to work
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly well where you can use a smaller
fabric pot for a larger plant where you
[SPEAKER_00]: might need a larger plastic or solid pot
for the same size plant otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is because of the roots getting into
outside and sending the signal out and
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of going around the pot it creates
a bigger mass of roots inside of the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: pot filling up the soil better and taking
better nutrients I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: In plastic pot this doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots once it hits the hole it will
try to keep growing because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing there, there's no hair,
there's nothing signal so she keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: searching for the deeper place and this is
why you get those pots with those big
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you are using fabric pots and you
take the roots out you take a block.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a block of soil and it looks like it
doesn't have any roots but there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of roots in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like a solid root mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the big massive root down there,
you get the roots going around and then in
[SPEAKER_02]: the center of it there's roots but it's
not the same, it really is not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall root mass is definitely
smaller if you were to grow the same plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in a fabric versus a plastic pot and at
the same time frame you'd find a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: root mass in the fabric pot by like the
end of 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the name of it but it's
because of the sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same happens that when the plant
gets to the soil it sees hair and it
[SPEAKER_02]: signals the roots to go down and she keeps
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it works the same way with the
fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that for the fabric pots and for
that that would be called air pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also just physically
prune the roots yourself if you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish the same thing in a smaller pot
or if you need to remain in that smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: pot for a longer period of time for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: In veg it's no problem to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will bounce back if it's not an
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that with an autoflower folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to trigger it to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those being some of the points where
you found, you know, you learned from
[SPEAKER_00]: something that went wrong, you know,
in your grow where you didn't intend for
[SPEAKER_00]: the outcome to be what it was but you
learned from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things where you went
into the process of being like I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to add this because I think that it's
going to increase x, y or z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where have you found a success in your
garden like that where you added something
[SPEAKER_00]: in and it did exactly what you wanted it
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I first heard about
mycorrhizal, I could not believe it myself
[SPEAKER_02]: that it would do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I start researching and I find out
that I believe it's in Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use mycorrhizal to do the subway,
meaning they place it at the stations and
[SPEAKER_02]: they put the mycorrhizal and the
mycorrhizal in the beginning make the big
[SPEAKER_02]: mess and then it creates the perfect roads
and they did the subway that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it was Japan, Taiwan,
somebody there did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they used like a mycelium culture to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I start researching and researching
and I start realizing, man, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest network that exists on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing bigger than mycorrhizal in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can think that, no, it's connected from
elsewhere to elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of believe that almost all plants
in the world are under-connected because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the mycorrhizal, not the ones in the
pots because they're by themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: but nature itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first time I implemented the
mycorrhizal in this case was after the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal in my plants, I did it side by
side because I wanted to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would make big difference or no
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy that the big roots,
the white roots, the channels,
[SPEAKER_02]: a root without mycorrhizal, it grows like
this and it has a little tiny hair,
[SPEAKER_02]: normal roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: A root with mycorrhizal, it grows like
that and it's thousands of hairs growing
[SPEAKER_02]: all over her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that things are receptors,
are connectors that will help the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really think that the mycorrhizal was
definitely the biggest thing that I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: results and it was exactly what I was
looking for and what I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the rest it is, but it is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was behind my expectations actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the endocannopyllites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is still a new factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my second run, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for my first run, that really was
crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not expecting almost double the
harvest and I get almost double the
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest that I would do on a 4x4.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy and it was not double the
power because the ICL 300, they are 150
[SPEAKER_02]: watts each one, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 300 watts more in the tens and on
top it's 700, meaning it's not double.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not 1400.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not supposed to go double.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went almost double, which I know it
was first run, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still need to experience more to see if
this actually is over-expecting what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: expecting or if this was just the perfect
run and now it's going to be hard to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: again and to replicate the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've definitely found that we are
getting a lot higher of a yield with the
[SPEAKER_00]: under canopy lights, but it's definitely
not double or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, we're not adding double
the total wattage input to that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even still with the under canopy
lights, if we're adding an additional 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: to the overall wattage input, we're not
seeing a 30% increase in yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we are still seeing an increase in
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest thing that I see is you
get an increase in overall uniformity of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality where the quality that you
typically go for, for me, my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers are typically about three or four
nodes down from the topmost bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's usually like picture
perfect, it isn't grown into another bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you dry it down and snap it away
from the stem, it gives you a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of the morphology of that
plant and the flower structure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome density and the bract development
and everything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a really nice representation of
the plant where the lowers would always,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they'd either be with some
cultivars, they'd be dense still,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they'd just be small popcorny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't have great color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if the plant up top turned nice
and purple, sometimes the lower stay a
[SPEAKER_00]: little greener, or maybe they'll be more
of like a light version of whatever color
[SPEAKER_00]: you get at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, won't necessarily
always develop fully, so they'll sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: still have white hairs or, you know,
just not be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not mature.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I added the under canopy lights,
I noticed that everything across the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy typically, as long as I'm keeping
that overall canopy density within the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of what my irrigation can provide
for it and what I can do for it based on
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factors, I can see
uniformity almost from that third or
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth bud down from the top, because
those tops still do what they do and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get dense and packed together at the very
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from about that third or fourth node
down all the way down through the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a very similar morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can turn a lot of what would be,
you know, B's or C's in my buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're separating them out
where you have A's, B's and C's in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the quality and the look and the
overall size and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn a lot of the B's into A's and I
turn a lot of the C's into B's or A's even
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases, as long as I'm OK with
having smaller flowers in that A's
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still hold up when you look at it as
color and tricum density and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: flower density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I found like I'm super
happy with that, because typically I would
[SPEAKER_00]: get like 20 to 30 percent of the overall
harvest wouldn't necessarily be something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could in the recreational market
sell as this top quality flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could press it, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole different aspect that
you would need like a specific license to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that in the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can turn all of my flowers into
A's and I can just make more pounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are resellable or kilos, depending on the
market that you're in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's well worth it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like for home growers,
if there is an aspect to the consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis for, you know, any other
grower out there, whether it be home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower or just a consumer that's going to
a recreational dispensary and picking up
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, you know, there's an aspect to it
about the flower itself and how it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it feels and, you know,
how it grinds up and how it breaks apart
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you can make a little bit more
uniformity across the board, that even for
[SPEAKER_00]: a home grower, you're going to have more
stuff that you're enjoying, then it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to last you for longer also because
all of those popcorns that you use,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you press, you would press if you make
RSO or if you make whatever you used to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is to exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a very small amount of it if
you do the good pruning, if you do a good
[SPEAKER_02]: defoliations and if you clean enough down
there, but leave enough still that you
[SPEAKER_02]: leave, it's bad now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smokable, but it's not popcorn,
like you were saying, or it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: underdevelopment, like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the plant finishes from top to bottom,
pretty much at all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, before this run, I would think on,
okay, maybe I harvest half of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will still leave that harvest half
to finish because I see that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: potential over here for it to still mature
and grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This did not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not happen with the last run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up harvesting two top of the
plants earlier, but this was because of a
[SPEAKER_02]: bud raw trying to get in and this was my
way of saving the closets.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very important thing for
everybody that is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when you're growing a very dense and
packaged room and that thing was really
[SPEAKER_02]: scrogged and super dense and buds get to
dense, airflow, it's very important and
[SPEAKER_02]: even with good airflow, even with good
conditions, bud raw can appear and early
[SPEAKER_02]: detections, it's very, very important
because otherwise it's all your work going
[SPEAKER_02]: bananas because it will spread really
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found one, I took it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the next day I found another one
coming here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided all the big tops on top of
the ones that were affected, I took them
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the sole reason why I harvest
them before because honestly the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: room in this case or the whole plant was
maturing at the same level, at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: pace, at the same rhythm and this was
beautiful to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the first time I ever saw this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mature top, not popcorn,
but a mature bulb down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In conjunction with that, through the
whole canopy to the whole room,
[SPEAKER_02]: this was something beautiful and then I'm
curious to see if it will happen here or
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I always will tell people also if
they're facing any sort of potential bud
[SPEAKER_00]: rot scenarios or botrytis or anything that
would affect the overall flower yield that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get out of a space due to
pathogens or other, I'm blinking on the
[SPEAKER_00]: word right now, but these different
mycology pathogens that you might face,
[SPEAKER_00]: molds or mildews, that by topping your
plants, early on and producing more tops
[SPEAKER_00]: for that one pot, you have the opportunity
to make those overall top colas a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit smaller each.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like each plant and this is just
anecdotal evidence, but I feel like each
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has a certain amount of potential
for overall yield based on the pot size
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you dedicate all that, that whole
plant into producing one cola,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't top the plant,
so you still do have side branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it still does kind of disperse that
energy across a large canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do have that one top cola where
it is going in and it's getting like a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher PPFD, maybe the environment there
is a little bit more ideal for overall
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and development, then you're gonna
get a lot larger of a cola, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to create a lot more potential for
pathogens to get into it and to take hold
[SPEAKER_00]: and ruin some of the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you top your plant and you let that
energy spread out across the canopy so
[SPEAKER_00]: that all the tops are kind of uniform,
then you can reduce that by having smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in some cultivars in a commercial
space, I've found that you get a more
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable morphology as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spread that energy around to a lot
more upper bud sites rather than just one
[SPEAKER_00]: large upper bud site and a bunch of side
branches, the only issue that I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: found with that is that I don't like
topping for any sort of growing style,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically, because if you look at it as a
top-down sort of planular view of a given
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy space, if it's completely flat,
let's say in a four by four tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have 16 square feet of canopy
that the light is hitting that you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to absorb and photosynthesize with as the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have peaks and valleys,
so if you keep those upper colas on,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you'll have almost like one upper
canopy where all, let's say you have nine
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in that four by four space,
you have nine upper colas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a lower canopy where all
the side branches kind of came up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have these peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you leave all the leaves on there,
then technically with those peaks and
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys, you're spreading out that four by
four space into a larger footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have the math in front of me,
but I believe you get about like 1.5 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.6 times the overall canopy space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than being 16 square feet,
you're like over 20 square feet at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point of overall, like highly
photosynthetically potential within that
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can increase your overall yield by
doing that, by capturing more photons as
[SPEAKER_00]: they leave the light and enter the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said before, it's very case
dependent where if you have massive colas
[SPEAKER_00]: that are gonna get rot, because let's say
you can't control part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, or it's just too big and it
just always happens, or there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic potential for different pathogens
to take hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you need to then potentially
top your plants or do something to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate the canopy to create a more
desirable flower structure so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have those potentials for
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this one, I tried it all, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a closet with six different
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was normal for them to grow
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And funny enough, the younger one,
the one that came later, because two of
[SPEAKER_02]: them did not terminate it, so I decided to
bring the papaya soap later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was two weeks younger than the rest
of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm making bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was two weeks younger than the rest of
the room, and she was the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: stretched or that bulked the most and the
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I super crop her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I band her.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scrub net on the top, she was talked
to, that I use on the top, I did not use
[SPEAKER_02]: for support.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used the scrub nets so that after making
the super crop, to hold her there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would super crop in the next
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would super crop again in the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, this particular one,
despite topping, was growing like this
[SPEAKER_02]: much distance from the LED up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, I don't know, crazy,
crazy numbers down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And despite having hair flow, she grew
colors like this, all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if it was, and I cannot
sacrifice the whole room just for that
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to keep the environment at 60% of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my case, this is what I like to do in
flower actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a risky thing for pathogens is
this and that, but they like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have no problems in there,
I do my whole flowers at 60%, maybe 55 by
[SPEAKER_02]: the ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't do like the most do like 50,
45.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start at 77% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll work it down over time to 60
and finish with the daytime humidity being
[SPEAKER_00]: around 55 and the nighttime humidity being
at 45 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I try to increase that temperature
differential too.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing I tried to do the
most when I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to keep a very similar temperature
from day and night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to bounce it the least I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that if I get 20, I will be talking
in Celsius, but I can actually tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, 20 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 78 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have it, let's go 24 because it's a
good one for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm at 70, which is a good,
good temperature, I try to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only do this in the, in summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep it the daytime and the
nighttime same temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's 70 at daytime, I will try and
keep it 70 at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in summertime, I can do this because I
grew during the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that daytime it's hot where I
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature goes up to
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s, 100s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's normal to be outside about 90s and
100s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are sleeping and they have the
temperatures from the outside here that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes into the house that keeps it warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So meaning that I get to in summertime,
I'm able to grow at about 80, 70 to 80
[SPEAKER_02]: both day and nighttime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find out that they like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like to grow in summertime
more than I like to grow in wintertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less humidity, first of all,
and they grow more stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow more beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit more expensive because
of the AC that you have to run AC still to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep things on balance because
temperatures sometimes go really high and
[SPEAKER_02]: you cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, if you're growing in the
night cycle, this means you have to work
[SPEAKER_02]: at night instead of working at day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperatures from the night with
balance bounce back with the lids with
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and you will create a more
stable room which lets bouncing on
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures and on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that our medicine specifically,
if she could grow always at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and always at the same
humidity, that would be the perfect for
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know because I could not do this
from seed to harvest ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is something that I would
definitely like to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had the meanings to do this,
I would try this actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of research on temperature
differentials in greenhouse settings where
[SPEAKER_00]: with certain flowering plants and stuff in
it, it's been proven to work in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run what's called a negative
differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: A negative differential being the
nighttime temperatures are greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: the daytime temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A neutral differential, which is what
you're talking about where the daytime and
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime temperatures are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a positive differential where the
daytime temperatures are greater than the
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that has been found with
cannabis is that if you run a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: differential earlier in the flowering
cycle where the nighttime temperatures are
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than the daytime temperatures,
you can actually reduce the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch that the plant goes through when
you go through that stretching bolting
[SPEAKER_00]: phase of the flowering period for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everywhere from that all the way
to a positive differential can adjust that
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch on the plant to where an extreme
positive differential where you have 10
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees or more in Fahrenheit,
I'm talking 10 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you will increase the ability for the
plant to stretch by increasing that
[SPEAKER_00]: positive differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used that before in an indoor
setting because I overveged my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to reduce the overall stretch
because I only had a certain canopy height
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could safely maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: for the production of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a perfect thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different research on it where you
can do it for like the first 15 or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes after the lights are turned off or
initiating the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other research about
doing it right before the lights come on
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing this negative differential
swing, but then maintaining a neutral or a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive differential through a later
period of the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot more research that I feel
like could be done with that as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: having more people try to apply this
research that is done on other crop plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis, where it could actually help
us as home growers and commercial growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, take advantage of the different
seasons and different temperatures and
[SPEAKER_00]: different changes within the environments
that we're facing and try to use them to
[SPEAKER_00]: our advantage based on, you know,
vegetative timing or reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can run the AC less at night,
or if you can run the heat less at the
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime or at night or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's a lot there that I
feel like could be applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always am I feel like I'm saying on
this podcast a lot that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is just another crop plant,
you know, it's just another agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should definitely be looking at the
research that's done for other agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it can apply to us rather than
just trying to separate cannabis out
[SPEAKER_00]: completely because it is, you know,
our special plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can take a little bit higher numbers
than most of the plants can take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why people, I think,
put it in a special because if most of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants can take 800 PPFT, our plant can go
up to thousands and something if they can
[SPEAKER_02]: eat this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are plants in the end,
there are seeds that grows and they take
[SPEAKER_02]: care, take, for instance, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow tomatoes the same way I grow weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I plant them and then I clean them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I clean the bottoms and I leave the plant
grows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the plant is up, I just let it
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty much the same as weed and
it grows better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find out that if I let it grow all over
the place that I don't have as many good
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes as I would have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find myself with the problems,
the same problems that I have in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is poor air flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no light penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this and that's bringing me
problems later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our plant is definitely special.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can take some pretty damn high numbers
on everything, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on food, on PPFT.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the amount of photons that this
girl can take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, you go outside in the sun
in the middle of the day and you take your
[SPEAKER_02]: PPFT meter and the numbers are crazy and
all the other plants are growing still.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do those numbers for them plants
inside of a greenhouse and you kill them
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a unique plant in certain ways,
but it definitely does what other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we shouldn't just try to limit
ourselves to only what applies to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: through a cannabis lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should try to definitely look at it as
as growers overall, because we can grow so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different things with the same
methods that we use for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can improve our growing of cannabis
by using the same methods we use for other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I feel like this is a great
place to start wrapping up the show a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions that I did want to
make sure that I ask you, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, for anybody that's watching
this video on YouTube, they'll notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: dog doctor is wearing a mask to protect
his identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have a lot of listeners in
the US, but we do have listeners in the
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries of Europe,
as well as I know that I've seen through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some viewers in Australia and
South America and in South Africa.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of different
places in the world where cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: still not even just regulated,
but fully illegal and punishable by some
[SPEAKER_00]: severe, severe laws and legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, coming from your
perspective with with all that in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: where would you like to see change in the
cannabis community and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just kind of that that
overarching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Group that is cannabis users, growers and
people that are involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love, first of all, I would love
for this plant to be discriminated all
[SPEAKER_02]: over the place, because it makes no sense
that people go to jail for plants in my
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
But.
[SPEAKER_02]: In its natural state, it's not like,
OK, cocaine comes from no cocaine does not
[SPEAKER_02]: come from like comes from a plant and from
a chemical thing with this, that and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just something that God gave us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the first, I would love to see this
happening all over the world, which I will
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that it will happen eventually,
but it still will take time for this to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to see people to take up
the step of even if it's masked,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I am with a mask, I know,
but people need to be more open and need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be to talk with each other more about
this plant and demystify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if the word demystify
demystified what?
[SPEAKER_02]: They did really good mystifying,
because if you really think about it 60,
[SPEAKER_02]: 17 years ago, this plant was just a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people would smoke it, other would
not, but it was not a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the hippie selection and all
the story that we all know came the
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition came this and all the
propaganda and they make it look like most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the world right now, like if you go and
talk with the generation of my parents and
[SPEAKER_02]: my grandma, they think of this as
something really bad and something because
[SPEAKER_02]: they paint it in the really dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the getaway drug to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the start for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is nothing of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that we all have inside
of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a cocaine or metafentamine
or whatever system.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is something bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can do whatever they want,
but I believe it's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be used in a bad way like
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything can be used in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is not here to make us bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here to help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to see people be more
open and going online.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mask came from the GML show and I was
going and covering the camera each time I
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I need to find a solution so
that I can speak more openly, but still
[SPEAKER_02]: show and if my face is not coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found at the time a mask from a dog
because my name was Dog Doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I start wearing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while I realized that I needed
something more, not so, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something better looking to my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get this, which allows me to come
like with you on a podcast, for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: and be talking and sharing my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think that people should lose
the scare because the most people that do
[SPEAKER_02]: things like we do, the more normal it
becomes and the faster we will have this
[SPEAKER_02]: available for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: By all means, I don't believe that
cannabis is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe that not having an
option, it's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's nobody died from from from
weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now with the extractions and all
the abuses and the food, I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that pretty soon we will have somebody
died from not directly from the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: because you need like five kilos of THC or
something to for your body to collapse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the same way alcohol you can drink and
drive and have an accident, they will
[SPEAKER_02]: blame weed somehow on the aspects on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she's not really the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is we make it the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be talking more openly about it
and be more receptive about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that this will happen when
people not come out of the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is maybe not a good word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when people start to be open to at
least understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is happening now with the
legalization happening all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have people that, OK, there's little
children's actually taking these.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's these that if they're giving this
to children with epilepsy and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually helping, this cannot be that bad
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things are opening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I definitely encourage these people
are not shy to a point that they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: mind talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should definitely go out and check
out the forums because we have a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: online community run out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's one one thing that I love
about this community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very open community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you start talking, people will
talk back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it's not like if you go for
a kitchen, for example, if you're working
[SPEAKER_02]: in the kitchen, chefs, they talk,
but they don't share secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's my my secret, my family's
secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my pride.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not telling you because after a while
you will open your restaurant and I will
[SPEAKER_02]: lose my sort of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is, of course, there is in if
you work in big facilities, probably there
[SPEAKER_02]: is the secret for the facility,
this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, speaking, we are very open
minded on sharing our knowledge or on
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing our mistakes, our lessons,
our our learnings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this makes this community a very
special one in terms of possibilities of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and of becoming a wider thing than
it is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely encourage people to to
don't be afraid of being themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want them to be lying or to be
somebody else because I think there's too
[SPEAKER_02]: many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us to be them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is if this is something that you
like, talk about it with your friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: with your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't dismissify it and help us all to get
this plant available to who may or may not
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because by all means, I have friends of
mine that cannot smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the paranoia, they get this,
they get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually think it's the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get the paranoia, there's probably
some different genetic for you that will
[SPEAKER_02]: work for your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's not for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my mom gets anxiety from smoking
anything with a high THC content in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if she has a CBD gummy or an edible,
then she's extremely happy with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the results of of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've I've met plenty of other people
that, you know, cannabis just isn't for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's no reason to
maintain a stigma towards people who use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, just as you wouldn't necessarily
judge someone for having a glass of wine
[SPEAKER_00]: or a beer after, you know, at the end of a
day while they're eating dinner or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you shouldn't be judging or or
retaining that stigma towards people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are using cannabis in the same in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, it can be abused just
like anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, food can be abused, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all sorts of different ways that
people abuse things in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, moderation, I guess,
would be a good thing to put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also understanding your limitations
and and using, you know, a cultivar strain
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis that works for you with the
correct cannabinoid and terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different things that,
you know, they they require so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: research on on the part of those who are
producing these products, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding and research on the
consumer's end of things where they they
[SPEAKER_00]: can try to find what works best for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that that that's a great
sentiment to have that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing for more access in different
parts of the world and and giving people
[SPEAKER_00]: an opportunity to learn more about this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, like that's why the show
is called The Way We Grow, because I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that people hear these
different stories of growers so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: community itself can grow and become more
knowledgeable and have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: share that knowledge with people and show
that there are just a lot of different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, unique and normal people that
use cannabis and that grow cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: that are part of this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I think that's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do just have a couple of quick wrap
up questions that I always like to add in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your favorite strain of all
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that that one has a no right
answer, because I mean, the constant
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for that runs that I talked to you
about, it's something that is still here
[SPEAKER_02]: in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely something that I'm
looking for that unicorn again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something special on the passion
fruit terpenes in the in that plant that I
[SPEAKER_02]: still think about it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably among my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't like to say I have a favorite
for a single reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have different jars with
different varieties, different effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see this as as food.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm eating bread every day,
I'm going to get nauseous of eating bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm eating sausage, it's going to be
the same with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to meet in the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will need different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will need different paladars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will need different everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on my mood, on my day,
I may need something that it's couch
[SPEAKER_02]: locking, or I may need something that it's
inspiring for me to grow and work and do
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have a favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it's not even more sativas,
because this is a broad talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the general people, they call it
sativa or indicate effect, which is which
[SPEAKER_02]: is not true, because there's sativa super
heavy, and there's indicates super,
[SPEAKER_02]: super inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like sativas for the day,
sort of speaking, the help living and for
[SPEAKER_02]: working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the indicates not indicates
again, but the the couch lock for the
[SPEAKER_02]: nighttime and for relaxation.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm also in the same
mindset of it's hard to pick one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's, you know, there's I'm
always trying new ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to say that one was my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, you know, look back in the past and
think of things that I really enjoyed that
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of reminisce upon and wish that I
had again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that's just me,
you know, looking through the rose colored
[SPEAKER_00]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the next question,
of course, is going to be probably just as
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who is your favorite breeder of all
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like I like Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Humboldt seed companies, they have a
real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is because they look for terpenes
more than they look for potency in their
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every seed that I pop from them,
it was always almost like a keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot keep them, but they're all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I have to go for one, I actually
would go for that one because it was the
[SPEAKER_02]: one from the everything that I try from
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had a bad a bad seed in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the rest, most of them,
I didn't like this or I didn't like that
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always something happening there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were the more stable ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, I have to go to fast buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, they are by far, but by far the
best out of flowers I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried a bunch of different seed
banks and I'm not supposing for them or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are very terpy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breeding they're doing, they're doing
and they are very stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow like the blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorites from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very peculiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like a syrup mixed with
fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it has like this
backstage of A's on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot really explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each time I grow, the plant grows
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a feeling that if I grew a
hundred of them in a room, there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: like three or four.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be different, which is normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And others don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I grow a banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: In six months I grow the banana,
but it's taking like danger and it's no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer the banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fast buds in that terms, they are
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow a lot of auto flowers,
but I have grown fast buds before and they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I never liked auto flowers
personally, because if I find something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really good, it's just so hard to
find it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you find a company or a
breeder that is doing good work and
[SPEAKER_00]: creating stable genetics where you can at
least sift through maybe a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes for your setting, then maybe it
is worth it for whatever it is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might need it for.
[SPEAKER_02]: For auto flowers, if you're running,
for instance, a perpetual and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: always a 24 or 18 hours place to place
lights, why not put an auto flower there
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have an harvest in between.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they didn't have the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they are getting the therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They getting good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's in the taste, but this not being
able to keep a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the things that in the
beginning on the auto flowers was crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: because I always cloned and now I cannot
clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like this and the next seeds will not
be this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can't find it again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your most memorable cannabis
related experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: You, when you mean most memorable is the
one that when I think about something that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens, the, that memory comes,
it was the one of the first times I ever
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not even skunk was super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the first time I realized in my
life, I was about 17, maybe I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: the age, but it was around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the, I smoke it and the other
weeds and other things that I would smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: you finished the joints and you would feel
it and I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't feel nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grabbed the rest of it and I make the
big fat one and.
[SPEAKER_02]: About half an hour after that layer,
this last one, I found myself tripping
[SPEAKER_02]: like on acid, man, but, but really on
acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the times I would do from time to
time takes some acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I really need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people would cause are you okay,
dog dog?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just leave me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was the most intensive and it was
the first time ever that I realized that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here for us to, it is here for us to play
and for us to please us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also here to teach us and to,
it's a serious plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, and this was when I really,
and from that moment on, I believe that
[SPEAKER_02]: was when I start respecting the plant as a
plant, as a being has being part of us
[SPEAKER_02]: until then it was just something for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point on, I realized it's
not just that because it can take me
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can make me see things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can make me realize things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gotta be sacred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, that's a, that's a pretty
powerful experience to have where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the sort of those time delayed
responses that some strains can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do end up over consuming,
you can have a very profound experience
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to leave a lasting
impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can totally understand how that kind
of changed your perspective of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this has been an awesome
conversation, dog doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you joining me on the
podcast today and telling more of your
[SPEAKER_00]: story so that more people can get out
there and grow their own plants or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, participate in this community in
their own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, telling stories like yours
where you are still in a state or a state,
[SPEAKER_00]: a country that is prohibitive on the use
as well as the growing of this plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to come on here and tell your
story is extremely, it's brave,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also so necessary for us to be able to
continue to grow this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I always say, that's the way we
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you just want to grow some European
seeds, I will be sending some up to
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and some seeds and some groove
bags to give everybody the same chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be, I want to make this not the
traditional cup where you find the final
[SPEAKER_02]: product is what it matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, this will be the journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: The evaluation will be on the journey
because I'm giving everybody the same
[SPEAKER_02]: chance, the same genetics, the same
nutrients and the same curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole journey is where I'm going to
evaluate sort of speaking people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if I'm going to have 10
entries of 100 entries, but I feel that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is something that if you're in the
prohibition land, we will be sending them
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere, of course, at your own risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please be whatever you are, be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it would be an honor and a pleasure to
have anybody that wants to join us on this
[SPEAKER_02]: journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anybody that's interested in that
reach out to dog doctor official on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and learn more from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we'll have maybe some of the
viewers and the different people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been on the show, join you for that,
for that grow challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again, dog doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will talk soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers love for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
