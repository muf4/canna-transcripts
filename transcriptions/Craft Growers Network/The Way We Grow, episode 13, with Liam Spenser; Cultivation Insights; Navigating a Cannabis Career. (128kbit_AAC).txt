[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast, a production of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Nick Wolfe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, our guest is Liam Spencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find him at TheFlyingLiamer on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also the owner of Ceres Cultivation,
where he helps growers optimize their
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation process and facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also an accounts executive with aroya
.io and also provides his cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise through the GrowWorld Ag
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liam, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been, you know, traveling a lot,
trying to keep up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just really excited to be here and have a
conversation and see what we can get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you come highly recommended for
having an educated cultivation discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: by a few different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was really excited to get you on
the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's new in your grow world?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a lot of different things and kind
of wear a few different hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that's kind of been at
the tip of your brain lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being that I'm working with
Aroya and I started in September of last
[SPEAKER_01]: year, I've gotten a lot of exposure to a
lot of facilities around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of cover from Michigan all the
way over to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to see sort of every,
every stretch of the indoor and greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: industry in each state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just get an idea for what
people are doing, how they're doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of understand, you know,
what's working for people, what's not
[SPEAKER_01]: working, best practices, what people are
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the exposure to that many facilities
has been really invaluable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously I was working for
Science LED before, and got to see quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of the facilities there, but kind of
expanding outside of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Michigan market, you know,
really highly compressed legacy markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, really the whole breadth of
performance across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really been the most interesting
focus for me lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can divulge anything along these
lines, I would love to hear what are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most innovative solutions that
you've seen people integrating into their
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities that maybe you
hadn't seen elsewhere, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just a really ingenious application
of something that normally may not be in
[SPEAKER_00]: that style of application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot going on and a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, being able to walk
into a facility and see, hey, these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are really, you know, making do with what
they've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing the best they can with what they
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sort of MacGyvering and ingenuity is
across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, between different
methods of collecting runoff to different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways of dehumidification, you know,
sort of what the, there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: running under canopy lights lately that
I've seen getting great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different, you know,
people playing with different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of mixed, mixed indoor
lighting, so HPS LED combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still see a ton of HPS lights in the
market, but the guys that are really
[SPEAKER_01]: performing well seem to have a really good
understanding of staff and workflow in the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their cost of goods is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, some of these,
you know, to kind of answer your question
[SPEAKER_01]: on specific applications, I've seen some
people really string together their own
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of solution even when they can't
necessarily afford something like a ROYA
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, like a agronomic IQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a bit of hot gas reheat
going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of people like kind of
modifying their HVAC units to get reheat
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting really good results with
stability in their humidity in their grow
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the combination of HPS and LED
does help a little bit with mitigating
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the sort of high increase in
transpiration that you get under LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you still see that, guys,
you know, putting far red at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day and, you know, early in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, it kind of all blurs
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen some pretty creative
things, you know, as far as benching and
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage goes, you know, sort of running
pipe drains under the benches or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stringing together irrigation
zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, you kind of put me on
the spot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to... No, you kind of
touched on all the hot topics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really great because,
of course, seeing it in application in
[SPEAKER_00]: these different, you know, commercial
facilities, it does show that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: where the market is looking right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at least on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are kind of forging a
path, whether it be through these like
[SPEAKER_00]: far-red light applications or the reheat
applications of their pre-existing air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioners so that they can get that
better dehumidification capacity for the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the things that you see a
lot of people talking about and have been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about at least for the past couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, I mean, telling to say that
it is being seen in the market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I do like to bring this
podcast a little bit back to your origins
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cultivator because it sounds like you
have a wealth of knowledge that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: tapping into when you're addressing these
different solutions and seeing these
[SPEAKER_00]: different either problems arise that
you're helping tackle and then finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that all has to come from
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the way back, what are some of the
first experiences you had with plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, whether it be cannabis or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then did it start with cannabis and go
to perhaps some vegetable gardening here
[SPEAKER_00]: and there, or did you do any vegetable
gardening with, you know, mom and dad or
[SPEAKER_00]: an uncle or an aunt or something like
that, and then transition any of that like
[SPEAKER_00]: passion or knowledge into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, there's a lot of cross
pollination across both of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, to say like my
journey with cannabis, started in one area
[SPEAKER_01]: and my journey with gardening kind of
started separately of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although when I was a kid in, in,
in high school, you know, first started
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming cannabis, you know, we'd always
get bag seeds and try to toss them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had these abandoned lots in our
neighborhood that we try to grow stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: never really turned into anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I, I didn't really grow
plants, I wasn't super interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: growing plants as like a, a business or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, professionally until I got
into college and I changed my major to
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got into a couple of classes like
ethnobotany and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of led me down towards horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a community garden on campus and
you could go there and just volunteer and
[SPEAKER_01]: work in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pretty, pretty decent sized
garden and you just go there and first
[SPEAKER_01]: time you volunteer, you're probably
spreading mulch around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, double digging plots or
whatever was needed to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you kind of progressed through
and got a little bit more experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: they started assigning, it showed some
level of proficiency too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd start assigning more complicated
tasks like transplanting or propagation,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got really into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was like that, this is really
exciting, you know, starting to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: closer understanding of where my food came
from and, and how to, how to cultivate it
[SPEAKER_01]: in different environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into aeroponic growing cause we had
a program on campus for the, it was
[SPEAKER_01]: through like the, the wellness initiative
where we had these aeroponic tower gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: planted all over campus and I helped build
them and clean them and take them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got involved in this project,
you know, as a volunteer where I'd go
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually got to a point where I
started giving these presentations and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of sharing how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in teaching people about vertical
gardening and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I sort of got really,
really into the more, into the soil-less
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and then did that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a lot of people ask me if I,
if I grew cannabis or if I was interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in doing that or did it in, in those
aeroponic gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of was very resistant to it,
kind of pushed back a little bit on it
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I had gotten in trouble for cannabis
in college and just kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to move away from, from that a
little bit at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I ended up living in a house
where I was able to, we had like an area
[SPEAKER_01]: where we could cultivate in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started playing around with,
with tent growing and then translated that
[SPEAKER_01]: into when I graduated college and I had
kind of traveled, I kind of left Orlando
[SPEAKER_01]: and I went to Costa Rica, did my
permaculture design course, stayed there
[SPEAKER_01]: to work on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a couple months after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then went down to Ecuador and I did
this like indoor or it was, it was an
[SPEAKER_01]: urban agriculture course and it was a once
a week class for a couple months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got, you know, learned kind of like
what their strategies were for raised bed
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, once, once I kind of finished
that and came back to the States,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working with a friend of mine who
had a business and that he was starting a
[SPEAKER_01]: business building garden beds for people
in their backyards and their front yards
[SPEAKER_01]: and different kinds of projects where he
was building vegetable gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got really involved, you know,
did a lot of builds at a lot of plantings,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of workshops, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then I moved over to back to
Orlando and kind of helped build another
[SPEAKER_01]: similar business up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little bit more high profile,
a little bit more boutique for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of the more, uh,
upscale neighborhoods, community gardens,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, living walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got really deeply involved in plants
outside of cannabis for awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually one of my friends started
working at Cura leaf in Mount Dora in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida when they were opening kind of
before they brought plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he continually tried to convince me
to, to join over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a bit resistant to it at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally he's like, all right,
let's see what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get in the commercial cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what year was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it was, it was, uh, it was when
Florida had gone medical, I think truly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but already established a couple of
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cura leaf had a site down in homestead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but this was like sort of their big
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about six acres of greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had, well, by the time I
left, they had expanded to building out
[SPEAKER_01]: about 250,000 square feet of indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So went from a team of like, initially
bringing on around 20 people, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up with over a hundred in
cultivation alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, probably even upwards
of that we had to, during COVID split into
[SPEAKER_01]: two shifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So half the cultivation team was on three
to four days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other half was split, but there
were still, you know, a hundred people on
[SPEAKER_01]: each shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a massive operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, still is a really big, and they're
still producing quite a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: over there, but that was my foray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into commercial cannabis outside of just
tent growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had so much experience growing and
gardening outside of cannabis that I
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up a lot of the techniques and the
procedures and practices quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a big focus was on operations and
efficiency and problem solving and
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution of labor and staffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really where a tremendous amount
of value came because there was all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this problem solving on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to do to make the operations work
and keep the gears turning efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so kind of having to sequence like
dozens of different processes,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of all happening at once and making
sure they all happened in a coordinated
[SPEAKER_01]: and efficient effort was, uh, probably the
biggest part of the learning process
[SPEAKER_01]: initially there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I got really into the technology
and the greenhouse management and managing
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the climate in the greenhouse and
using all these different controls,
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms like Preva and Ritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we had this other old
platform called Qcom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was, I guess, micro grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we had, and then we had an internal
BAS system that was made on site in house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so there were all these different
programs I had to learn and then had to
[SPEAKER_01]: help commission the climate control system
skid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really just got deep into uncovering
how all these controls and technologies
[SPEAKER_01]: worked and figuring out how to optimize
them to get the best environment in that
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was really a lot of poor design
decisions went into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of MacGyvering and
problem solving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mind, uh, talking a little bit more
about your time at Cura Leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I feel like with such a large
facility, you could probably see some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, um, some of the best aspects of the
commercial cultivation, uh, industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some of the, the potentially
the worst parts of the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation industry, just, you know,
in terms of efficiencies or discrepancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's a lot there to
probably unpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever you feel comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I mean, there's definitely a lot
to unpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I fully, uh, acknowledged
that there were, there was a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, poor decisions that were made,
uh, over there and they, they learned a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The company as a whole learned a lot,
uh, in the process of retrofitting and
[SPEAKER_01]: then building out on that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they're, they're,
they spent quite a lot of money on trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to retrofit the greenhouse and initially
there was some guidance to retrofit it,
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it more, uh, representative of an
indoor space within the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with the intention being
that, Hey, you know, maybe we can use AC
[SPEAKER_01]: to mitigate some of the external heat
coming from Florida outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the execution was, uh, there were a
lot of challenges and a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, turnover on the director side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we had a lot of leaders in that
facility turnover every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of that just came down
to like, you know, playing a blame game
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or trying to, um, trying to understand
like why certain decisions that were made,
[SPEAKER_01]: that spent a decent amount of capital,
weren't yielding results or turning into
[SPEAKER_01]: positive outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, that was a big part of what
I was trying to do there was, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: we, when I came in there, they had taken a
lot of the aspects of the greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_01]: were functioning and growing orchids
beforehand and sort of shut them off and
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to, you know, do what they could to
seal off the environment or make it an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, um, probably not the best
decision in the long run, but I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: understand where they were coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they, they, you know, quickly
realized that Florida greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions are not optimal for cannabis of
any variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although some like we had Afghani that
usually performed pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, handled the tropical climate much
better than some of the other cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: that were brought over from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yeah, I mean, you know,
just with that large of a site and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and expanding that quickly, there's always
going to be issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think that there really
had been many facilities across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country of that size and that scale up
until that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody really knew how to turn that
into a, um, a proper production site,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds daunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge learning curve and,
and there's, you know, everyone's always
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make bad decisions when,
you know, but as long as you learn from
[SPEAKER_01]: them, I think building the indoor was a
good decision on their part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just to produce the volume and quality
that they kind of were anticipating out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse, like just wasn't
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I think, uh, you know,
with, without trying to look back from an
[SPEAKER_01]: objective place of like, Hey, you know,
what were we trying to accomplish there?
[SPEAKER_01]: The team on site, the team on the ground,
we really did well offending for ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of as this revolving door of,
of, uh, direction was happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: we figured out a way to kind of stabilize
and ground ourselves to be able to manage
[SPEAKER_01]: all the people we had to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had over 40 people that I had to
be responsible for at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I kind of transitioned more
into just fully taking on the
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility of managing the lights and
the curtains and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the, uh, mechanical aspects and
really kind of dive into, to deeply into
[SPEAKER_01]: learning the technology that was at our
disposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they had, you know, there were
thousand gallon batch tanks for each zone
[SPEAKER_01]: that were hand mixed every day in that
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were guys in this, the water
room, just mixing tanks all day for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have any sort of dosing system
set up or not until they commissioned the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate control system skid, which was
towards the end of my time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left in, uh, end of summer of 2020 when
COVID kind of, it was a, there was a big
[SPEAKER_01]: transition during that period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had, um, I had to report to somebody
who came in very recently, who I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: coach and train and, and educate that,
um, that was basically, I would say it
[SPEAKER_01]: made me feel a little bit, um,
undervalued on site there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, without saying too much,
I just didn't really, uh, I didn't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciated or respected for the amount of
sacrifices and time and effort I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started looking for other
opportunities and got the chance to move
[SPEAKER_01]: to Colorado to, to, to work on indoor
craft cultivation, which was a piece that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really interested in that I hadn't
had the chance to do up until now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I mean, the, um, the underappreciated
and overworked aspect is something,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I come from a culinary background
before I got into cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, of course it was like taking
people who were passionate about something
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, abusing that passion for the
gains of the company because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to put in all that effort because
they were searching for knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when given an opportunity with,
you know, such a large facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost look at that going in and
be like, Oh my God, this playground that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been given, I can learn so much from
what they have to offer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then all that effort and you then you
have to train the person who's taking over
[SPEAKER_00]: the position that's going to lead you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that doesn't sound like a good
leadership decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it does seem like an
underappreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot that goes into that
sort of decision, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, I understand there's a level of,
uh, like I think I preach this often,
[SPEAKER_01]: but staffing leadership and culture are
really what drive performance in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: ways, because when you have a team that's
passionate, that feels appreciated,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, they continue to work hard to continue
to elevate that, especially when they see
[SPEAKER_01]: upward mobility or at least being treated
well and being, being shown some
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes a really long way,
especially compounding over larger and
[SPEAKER_01]: larger teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I see the most successful
gardens have the most cohesive and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, cultural teams when I, when I visit
facilities, kind of going back to what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was saying before, but, um, you know,
what I, what I learned through CureLeaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: which subsequently translated into what I
did briefly at Be Good, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: just finding, just having, uh,
quality communication between people and
[SPEAKER_01]: teams and feeling like we're humans
outside of, of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, that goes a really long way
and there's, there's often, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a lot of resources allocated towards,
you know, team appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked at Whole Foods before I
worked in the cannabis industry and they
[SPEAKER_01]: did a lot to try to keep the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before Amazon got involved, but they did a
lot to try to like promote culture within
[SPEAKER_01]: the company and, you know, team building
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, there's, uh, I think with big
companies, it's often challenging to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's so many different
variabilities from site to site and the
[SPEAKER_01]: type of people that are available to work
at each place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very hard and you often do have to
bring people on from outside, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: to higher positions, but promoting from
within, I mean, there's some guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend out in Nevada who's very
much, uh, very fond of promoting from
[SPEAKER_01]: within and training and bringing people
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think your greatest success comes
from having people that work, that once
[SPEAKER_01]: worked under you at a certain point,
um, elevate to that level of success to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to go out, you know, like,
like it's a, it's a compliment when you
[SPEAKER_01]: hire somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get offered a position,
you know, at that director or manager
[SPEAKER_01]: level outside it, it feels good to know
that that person's skillset is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is evolved and competent enough to take on
that kind of role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I really think investing in your
people, uh, makes the big, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in the world, especially in
markets that are really tight and very
[SPEAKER_01]: bleak and people don't feel like it's nice
when everything's going well and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's making money and you're all
bonusing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but when you're having a hard
time paying the bills and paying your team
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that, like it's, uh, morale is
very easily dropped and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: infectious when you have low morale in
both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morale is a very infectious aspect of the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, that's like some of the biggest things
that I feel like the industry faces right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is, um, in this downturn that we're
all facing is keeping the morals high
[SPEAKER_00]: enough so that the, there's still a
continued strive for excellence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that's being produced because it
can so easily fall to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you're feeling underappreciated or
if you don't feel as though there is any
[SPEAKER_00]: hope for the future, basically,
you know, when you look at this and you
[SPEAKER_00]: go, man, over the past five years,
we have not been necessarily trending
[SPEAKER_00]: towards, uh, uh, you know, this high
profit margin that we were at,
[SPEAKER_00]: at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I, I, I think that investing in
your team is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at all times, but especially when
times are tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I mean, if you're really good,
it's easy for you to get taken advantage
[SPEAKER_01]: of, uh, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, there was, I, there was a
point at my journey at be good that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: solely responsible for about 150 light,
140 light facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have any full-time team
members over on that site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I just had to make it work
and kind of continue to keep the operation
[SPEAKER_01]: going and turning crops and turning cycles
around, even though the facility was
[SPEAKER_01]: horribly inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no capital to be able to invest
because there was, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: a previous contract grower that had,
uh, some conflicts with the ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was just a lot of, uh,
mismanagement of resources and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, leading to kind of a zero sum game
where you're driving your cultivators to
[SPEAKER_01]: do more and more work, you know,
less and less people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's, that seems to happen a lot
where you're, you're like running down to
[SPEAKER_01]: a skeleton crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a fine line between operational
efficiency with minimum amount of labor
[SPEAKER_01]: required to get each task done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole, you know,
between that and like just having the
[SPEAKER_01]: absolute barest bones people on staff to
just keep the building open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just expect way too much of those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to come in on the weekends all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not really fair and not
sustainable long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody is really good and they
can do it, it doesn't necessarily mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that you should make them, uh,
you know, so especially with no stake in
[SPEAKER_01]: the business or no, and that's a tricky
game too is like, equity is not usually
[SPEAKER_01]: the right move for like a cultivator,
but it can be, it's just a matter of what
[SPEAKER_01]: is the capacity and what is the potential
feature of this business?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen so many cultivations in Colorado
alone just turn over and go out of
[SPEAKER_01]: business or shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's, uh, even some of the,
the, what I thought would be some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: more quality, um, businesses, they just,
they can't get their cost of goods down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get their price.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selling price high enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't pump out enough consistent
crops regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are some of the key pain
points that you see a lot with compressing
[SPEAKER_01]: markets that are built upon a high price
per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, like Colorado took a while to
compress, so people didn't really realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that $2,000 pounds were not really
reasonable anymore until it was too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people using products like
bio biz and, um, mills or all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different products that are crazy high
price point per gallon mixed and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, still just, you know, running that
because they didn't want to accept the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth says they were coming down the
pipeline of the prices continuously
[SPEAKER_00]: falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you have to learn how to
run, uh, with a lower overhead and input
[SPEAKER_00]: costs, you start to just see all of these
other problems arise because you aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning in a holistic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of slamming the brakes and
pulling a U-turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I mean, I would say that the
gravity of impact of input costs changes
[SPEAKER_01]: at different scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I still see guys that are running
house and garden, but they're doing well
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're getting higher price per
pound and the quality and flavor of their
[SPEAKER_01]: product is better, but they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting out, you know,
very, you know, like somewhere around a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred to a couple hundred pounds a month
as opposed to large facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking to like the gravity
of those, those quantifiable changes in
[SPEAKER_01]: input costs, a couple cents per gallon
maybe makes more of a difference at,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, at a facility that's selling commodity
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to use something that's going
to be way more cost effective because now
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking tens of thousands of
dollars a week or a month as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: like a couple hundred bucks per crop
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think that's that you have
to distinguish what, what context you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause not always is the change in lower
fertilizer costs can reflect in a better
[SPEAKER_01]: business outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's something that I think
often is overlooked where we speak in
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutes about, I just need cheaper
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need cheaper nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need what cheap lights like,
you know, all of these factors are much
[SPEAKER_01]: more complicated than just speaking from
directly a price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you're talking economics,
you have to build out the whole pro forma
[SPEAKER_01]: on that equipment almost every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you don't really understand the
downstream financial impacts of getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: $300 led that may go out in two years or
that degrades or the spectrum shifts over
[SPEAKER_01]: time or whatever the problem might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, you get cheap sensors to
monitor your substrate and then you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to constantly calibrate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's tons of labor going into that
or whatever the case may be, where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually downstream causing, you know,
higher labor or, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: costs to look, let's say, you know,
you get, I mean, I'm not, maybe don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: to use the sensor thing, but you get a
cheap piece of equipment and now you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not trusting that what you're seeing is
accurate or real and you can't make
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, there's things like that,
like cheap cocoa has inconsistencies in
[SPEAKER_01]: volume and salinity levels, uh,
rock wall, you know, there's, there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: many different aspects to input cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often look above consumables to just
like, you know, operating costs as a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: of like, okay, are you renting the
building?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, um, you know, what is your,
what are your licensing fees on a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how many pounds do you need to
produce to get, uh, to get to that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, of what is profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the economies of scale are so marked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Arizona has a lot of massive
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're limited license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those massive facilities don't have to
produce premium top shelf flour all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to sell all their product out,
you know, but Colorado, there's a way
[SPEAKER_01]: more, there's a way higher, uh,
volume of producers to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, it's a bit more diluted
and saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that you have to have a
high quality product and check all the
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes in order to have a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand with, with marketing that's
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, and, and that's where you,
you may be producing a few hundred pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: a month is probably too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you want to have market scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we, I think we only do produce,
uh, like around 60 pounds a month or so at
[SPEAKER_00]: our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a hundred percent sure on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't quote me, but we, um,
I mean, it, it seems to work better to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little bit of, uh, uh, under
production or scarcity, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the market, uh, is just
continuously eating up whatever it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but even still with the downturn
price, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I, I do hope that at some point,
maybe that there is just like more,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, quality recognition for brands and
stuff, because sometimes it feels as
[SPEAKER_00]: though the, the branding doesn't
necessarily reflect the quality and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can always be a little bit of a
hindrance for the consumer when they go
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of what they see through social
media or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, brand brand, uh, transparency and like
having a brand that stands up for a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific thing and tries to do its best to
fulfill that is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there have been brands here in
Colorado that have fallen because their
[SPEAKER_01]: quality dropped off and they were a
quality brand and they lost all consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumer trust because their quality
started dropping off and then they just
[SPEAKER_01]: fell off and fell out of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do have to be consistent and honest
and transparent with your brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and make sure that you're not
overselling your brands and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is a super premium quality brand
at a high price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you look at the product quality on the
shelf next to another brand and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, there's a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what those quality metrics are is so,
uh, so variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and I would, I would even venture
to say like subjective, um, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: objective, but the, uh, the end of the
day, like what every consumer shops for
[SPEAKER_01]: product for a different reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at market trends,
a lot of people are shopping still on
[SPEAKER_01]: potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, potency doesn't always directly
correlate to quality, but quality has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of other metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, your brand has to be honest and
representative of the product you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting into the market and know what your
target customer base is and satisfy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone's going to be the best
quality producer in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not everybody wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to sell to the top,
to 10% of the, of the market and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a, you know, 40% of the industry is trying
to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's only so much room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does seem to be this, uh,
this constant battle between quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity that you hear a lot, but,
um, I mean, there are ways to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: both, especially at the scale,
um, that where it's feasible for that
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, it doesn't seem like it is
even possible to have all of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you say 40% of the brands are trying to
vie for that top 10% of the spots,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it may just be better to, you know,
take, except that maybe there's brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that are better than yours and just try to
find your niche elsewhere rather than be
[SPEAKER_00]: in that top 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems like a very hard, uh,
uh, that, that almost seems like a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: crown to wear because then you have to
maintain it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every brand has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes in quality and consistency over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's an unavoidable
aspect, but the tighter you can get your
[SPEAKER_01]: operations and this goes beyond branding,
you know, being in that top 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, uh, you know, it goes,
it goes getting to that point of
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency to be able to put out that
product in that top 10% goes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes far beyond, you know, just your
parameters and your cultivation and being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to repeat your processes,
whether it's irrigation, or environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic selection is a huge piece of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like really making sure that you're
driving new genetic material into the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and bringing in quality cultivars
that are sort of setting the pace,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause otherwise you're just chasing and
you do have to have a stable of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of, you know, your sort of staple
cultivars that people like to consume and
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to maximize those and bring those
to consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, again, it's,
it's, you, I couldn't tell you like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, you need 50% of your garden to be
these cultivars that are always selling
[SPEAKER_01]: out that everybody wants and 50% to be
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's just always going to be a
product of what your feedback is from the
[SPEAKER_01]: retail, you know, from your buyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of these markets are like,
uh, retail plus wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're the strains that the wholesale
buyers want are oftentimes much different
[SPEAKER_01]: than what the retail buyers want,
but the retail buyers are only buying
[SPEAKER_01]: small volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to figure out how to satisfy
demand without distributing resources too
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great, um, description of what
we're facing here in the Oregon market
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the wholesaler versus the
retailer and, and just kind of what each
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate because the retailer
is usually looking for higher quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: are more willing to pay a higher price.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that quality, because they have the,
you know, that direct knowledge of their,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, customers and who's going to come in
and buy, you know, two ounces a month of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product for the next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've, so they're already know that
they have that sold basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas wholesalers, you know,
you just go in and they say, what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: got for cheap?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the buy one, uh, get one half off,
uh, what's your deals of the week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that, that always is a huge
difference in, in what they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably prioritizing the
retailers, but then the retailers only can
[SPEAKER_01]: buy so much at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to have, you know,
accounts receivable for a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, these retailers, cause they can't
necessarily pay cash on delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for you to get into all of these
retailers, you have to agree to some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of terms in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, they're paying the higher
price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take a little longer for you to get
the money, but you're going to get more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have to have somebody fully
dedicated to chasing down new orders and
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that, that game just
becomes high labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, whereas with wholesalers, if you can,
you know, just work with a few guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: are purchasing a large volume at a time
and they're, they maybe are paying lower,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, lower price for your product
and are less discretionary on the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that, that still is a high portion of
your market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe allocating time and energy to
satisfying those customers, if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still driving profits because they're much
lower, uh, labor costs, that's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's a, another whole decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to be in all the stores
and have their product brand be at the top
[SPEAKER_01]: and get all that highest price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just takes so much because you have
all of the packaging aspects, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing, you have to, you know,
go to these dispensaries, sometimes set up
[SPEAKER_01]: a table, educate the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there, there's a lot that goes
into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not really my, my, um,
sort of knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not very, I mean, we had retails when
I was working at be good that we were,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we sold directly out of a lot of our
product out of our own retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, a lot of the strains
that I was cultivating either I was
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in and they would say,
Hey, this is really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got great feedback, grow more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they were like, Hey, do you have this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you grow this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like this constant struggle
between, cause when you're vertical,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you have to balance satisfying
the customer demands with what is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: production viable in the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants, you know, I don't know
what people, I mean, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted very specific things like these
really old sativas or like a Durbin or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some stuff that had it in it
that was more production viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it was this constant battle
between like product quality meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: different shelf demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were putting certain products on the
top shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other strains would go into the middle
shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were trying to cover all of the
bases with one cultivation and a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: retails that were hitting all of the tiers
and the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that there was a lot
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of a, still a
disconnect there, but from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, our focus a lot was on like,
what is revenue generating?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I learned a lot and,
you know, we made a lot of mistakes in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of like chasing flavors and wanting
to grow certain strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we liked them because we thought
they were good and we thought they would
[SPEAKER_01]: sell and people would want to buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we put it out and then they didn't,
but then we had all of these genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we made a lot of, uh, you know,
we made some oversight, uh, mistakes in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of, you know, the business aspect
of, of producing cultivars for the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oftentimes, you know, the,
the cultivation would be backed up on
[SPEAKER_01]: certain flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the retail couldn't sell at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we didn't have a lot of customers
coming in and then it was just back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes they'd clear us out and
then we'd be, we'd be running behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, uh, very much like a roller
coaster in, in some, in some capacities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we did better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a bit of a disconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, having the
operations that when you, when you are
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical, uh, the, that can be really
insulating and really positive for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of companies because you're not subject to
wholesale bulk prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can, if you can move your
product, so you have to scale it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are we producing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are we selling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we make sure that we, if we
overproduce, can we still get a wholesale
[SPEAKER_01]: price that makes this product worthwhile
and viable and profitable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and do we want our product in other
people's stores?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like then maybe we do want to sell out
some of our premium brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of different
things and that's just Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not as familiar with the
retail game in Oregon, but I know that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can imagine from what I've heard,
it's challenging as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, there's a couple of vertically
integrated, uh, cultivation and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, retail spots, but, you know,
not a bunch of, uh, sort of the mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: pop style, um, vertically integrated
spaces that were like in Colorado or,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Michigan, uh, you know, I believe when
Michigan first went recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything had to be vertically
integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so things like that, it,
yeah, I don't, I don't see that much out
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, when you first entered
into the Colorado market after leaving,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, Florida, what were some of the,
uh, facilities that you, you were working
[SPEAKER_00]: with, um, other than be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tell us some more of the,
like what you saw and how you developed
[SPEAKER_00]: more of your, um, like the key points in
which you direct your cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what were some of those things
that you saw?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I tried to connect with as
many people in the industry when I moved
[SPEAKER_01]: to Colorado as I could, because I had a
lot of guys that I'd worked with at cure
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf in Mount Dora that came from
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came from a bunch of different
companies like green man and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, native roots and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to build my network out there
and made some friends that were really
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was where I first really got
introduced to precision irrigation or crop
[SPEAKER_01]: steering or kind of, you know,
some of these more, uh, advanced and I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess more precise, uh, strategies,
but it gave me the opportunity to like get
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and see what other people were
doing, make some friends, and then kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: get some ideas and bounce feedback off
some of my colleagues where I could really
[SPEAKER_01]: make all the decisions, a lot of the
decisions financially, not so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at least like cultivation practices,
like substrate are we growing in,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, how are we watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, what nutrients are we using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, some of these, these less
infrastructural, more kind of subjective,
[SPEAKER_01]: arbitrary kind of things that were based
on per grower preference and growers
[SPEAKER_01]: style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was easy to pivot because the first
grow that I was running was 125 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a ton of neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in a, it's in an area that,
uh, was no, it was initially when Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: went, went legal, a lot of people started
building grows in this particular zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were, uh, there were tons of,
of facilities in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were tons of growers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was easy to kind of connect,
but then obviously through COVID people
[SPEAKER_01]: stopped hanging out and connecting,
uh, there was a bit of isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I mean, you know,
I got, I kind of got to meet some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger players and some people who were
doing, doing things well, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people and still to this day, but
especially back then, a lot of people had
[SPEAKER_01]: not adopted drip irrigation even,
or, um, uh, you know, LEDs were just,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was very resistant to,
to upgrading technologies and getting new
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, um, it was, uh,
it was, it was definitely, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: eyeopening to see how many people were so
committed to this, like home grower style
[SPEAKER_01]: growing strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, being able to like dive
into, you know, I worked with EST tech
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I met David.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he introduced me to a lot of
different technologies, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Arroyo obviously was, uh, partially
through him, just as in he was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: few people I knew actually had used at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had done a demo with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got priced out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were these like different,
uh, different things like LEDs and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: use them properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of people struggled to get
yield with LEDs in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it was infrastructural,
like people with drywall, everyone has
[SPEAKER_01]: mold problems here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's dealing with botrytis or some
kind of a aspergillus contamination,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they have to decontaminate flower and
they don't have the facilities to drive
[SPEAKER_01]: clean infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that's really
nice about Michigan is people built these
[SPEAKER_01]: grows with like DPS paneling and,
uh, you know, a lot of the right,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not all, I mean, by, by no means is it
like overall kind of dialed, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, people did things a bit better cause
they learned from the mistakes of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado guys and maybe Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of drywall, a lot of exposed
wood, a lot of spray foam, a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are like, uh, potential surface area
contamination risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that's a major
thing I learned a lot about working there
[SPEAKER_01]: was how to manage, uh, microbial issues in
the garden and how to manage pest issues
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, because we had so many grows
nearby, we had so many vectors for issues
[SPEAKER_01]: and guys working in the grow that home,
home grows or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, dealing with botrytis and mold
and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I tried the reactive oxygen
generators, HEPA filtration, UV,
[SPEAKER_01]: PCO, whatever, you know, I tried all these
different ways to passive and active
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanitation, spraying zero tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everyone was doing tons of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one really knew a good solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's rad sourcing flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I mean, you know,
to touch back on your point of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what did I learn?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I see being so close to so many
different craft grows and being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a lot of those decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I didn't get to choose the HVAC
or the lighting or the racking or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a huge problem with runoff where
we really, weren't able to drive much
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff cause we didn't have floor drains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we had to learn how to steer our
plants with the least amount of water and
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer we could, um, to get the
desired outcomes, which was very limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: and very challenging to get yield because
we were having hard times bulking
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, uh, and making sure that our pH
and runoff was in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that was some of the,
the stuff that was a little bit newer to
[SPEAKER_01]: me when I got there that I think I
developed a really high level of
[SPEAKER_01]: proficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was just doing what I could with what
I got, you know, like having to problem
[SPEAKER_01]: solve and troubleshoot and figure out a
way around it around, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that builds such a great
foundation though, for, um, future
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge application, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So because now you have, um, the
understanding of how the parts work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take those parts and, uh,
reassemble them in a way that works better
[SPEAKER_00]: for, uh, the scenario that you then have
at hand in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I always like to think of it as
like a big puzzle, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, you're building that border of
the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get that last corner piece in
or side piece in everything else starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of fall into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it is a puzzle at first trying to
figure out where the different pieces go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you see it, you get that bigger
picture and you can kind of plug and play
[SPEAKER_00]: with all those different things that
you've built your knowledge on over years
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, you know, experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's say like a water line fails or
you need a bypass on something,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you need some redundancy in your
airflow or your dehumidification or
[SPEAKER_00]: something because, oh, it went down this
one time and the whole room turned into a
[SPEAKER_00]: giant mold fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you, you, you see all these things
over time and you start to build,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a bigger resilience for issues as they
get thrown at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, dealing with the,
well, if this happens, then we do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always as a result of having person,
you know, real world experience with those
[SPEAKER_01]: things, it's very hard to solve problems
that you've never dealt with without the
[SPEAKER_01]: right tools or at least some sort of
reference and not being afraid to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: experts for help or people that,
you know, have a higher level of knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: or experience on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that a lot in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I relied a lot on my network and my people
to be like, Hey, what do I do about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What this is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you do in this situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we had this outbreak or we had this,
um, or I had this person who was really
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, all of these things like a
water line busted, a pump went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had to hand water, you know,
there were times when our fertigation
[SPEAKER_01]: skid, I won't say, you know, uh,
who it was, but yeah, like I went to go
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrade cause we had to do this in order
for the skid to function.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to upgrade the firmware in the,
or the software and I had to replace this
[SPEAKER_01]: component and it was like over a weekend
and the whole thing failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to come in over night and hand
water Rockwell, like in two flower rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: just spent the whole night watering,
uh, hand watering Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, that was just like a really,
yeah, it was like, there was no other way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't, you know, get my fertilizer to
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's little things like that happen
where, oh, we had a room flood cause a
[SPEAKER_01]: solenoid valve stayed open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how do you bounce the plants back from
getting flooded, like entirely flooded
[SPEAKER_01]: with our water all night?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you, you don't want to overwater
them, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And fortunately at that time I was playing
around with some dissolved oxygen bubblers
[SPEAKER_01]: and like little things like, okay,
like I know if this, this situation
[SPEAKER_01]: happens based on this situation that
happened to me before, like this is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: think would be the outcome and what I
could see being, being the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, but I, you know, I,
I, even to this day, I still rely a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: on, on feedback and ideas from my
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's how what's helped me
just in the resourcefulness aspect,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like figuring out how to problem solve and
troubleshoot things when like building my
[SPEAKER_01]: own, you know, I worked with one of the
guys at the company to build our own
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental controls platform because we
didn't have one and we just had
[SPEAKER_01]: thermostats and it was like, how are we
managing our environment with just wall
[SPEAKER_01]: thermostats and wall humidistats?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start, we got some eco bees,
we got some relays, we took the home
[SPEAKER_01]: assistant program and we put it all up and
built this dashboard set protocols and we
[SPEAKER_01]: could look at our trending data over time
and like, you know, that, that worked like
[SPEAKER_01]: to an extent it wasn't great, but it was
better than not having anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, so little things like that,
or like building out a full irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: system in a grow that was hand watered
without any resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had to figure out where to get
tanks and pumps and solenoids and PVC
[SPEAKER_01]: piping and just scrap it from different
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old grow, whatever it was,
put it on my orders for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like, you know, adding to the
cost, like little things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, coming into a grow
that had three bedrooms and they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: open to like, whenever you walk into the
grow, you walk right into the mom room and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's spider mite webs and so,
okay, how do we fix this and consolidate
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the amount of, uh, the education I
got on solving problems in a highly
[SPEAKER_01]: dysfunctional environment and grow across
many of the facilities that I've operated
[SPEAKER_01]: in is I think, you know, like there's,
there's an aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, um, you know, you learn a lot
about what not to do and design and build,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you also learn how to like make do
with what you got and figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: get, get to optimal, not ideal,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a conversation I have with
people often is, you know, we chase ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: and I chased ideal for a long time of
like, what is the ideal conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the, what's the ideal
environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this ideal substrate look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have ideal conditions,
like ideal, like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a setting, that is, um, sort of,
and nothing's really truly ideal,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, cause you could always take it to
the next step, but you know, making the
[SPEAKER_01]: best out of the environment you have,
which might mean, Hey, at nighttime,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't turn our nighttime temps down
because we don't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification to pull out, to keep that
1.2 or three VPD at 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't go down to 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but so what do we do instead?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we solve that problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can't run the rooms as cold,
whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't buy more dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you're like, okay,
well, what's going to be the best outcome
[SPEAKER_01]: with what we do have to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we can't run our plants off,
how do we stack EC and then also drive EC
[SPEAKER_01]: down in the substrate later in the flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's, um, it's a common thread
on this podcast that we end up bringing up
[SPEAKER_00]: Liebig's law and the different staves of
the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how, if you have a limiting factor in
one of those staves, then the water is
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to overflow before it hits the
top of the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people look at that and they
say, Hey, I want to bring that stave all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up so that you have a full barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes they need to think,
maybe I just need to cut the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel off where that stave is so that I
can get optimal performance at the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, the, you have your limiting
factor, bring everything else down to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate within the best possible
parameters for that limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you end up, uh, doing much
better than you would think you would be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing when you say, Oh, I'm operating at
75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I, I'm not going to get 75% of my
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you end up getting 85% or 90% of
what you might've got at a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent, because sometimes you have
diminishing returns on yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, based on, you know, as you,
you can only give it so much before you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I, that's a very, very valid
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up because we
tend to bring this up all the time on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, especially for home
growers or smaller commercial cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you do get kind of lost in the sauce
of, I want the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have everything perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I gotta make sure that I just optimize,
optimize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually you start to see,
Oh, I can't really get past this one
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bring everything back down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you were probably producing some
fire flower at that level or just
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent, you know, like, you're not
over, you're not frying your plants by
[SPEAKER_01]: just over revving the engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's some nuance to that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, um, what I, what I have noticed
is like, let's just take CO2 for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you, which other levers or which
other staves in that barrel are more
[SPEAKER_01]: impacted by a limitation on CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like, cause in this, I bring this up
cause I've seen this in facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: recently here in Colorado, there's like
sometimes a, a shortage and like you have
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 and then the next day you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't have it for a certain
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have to make real time
adjustments to your light intensity and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, even your nutrient inputs and,
uh, your irrigation strategies,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause you're not assimilating as much
carbon into that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that CO2 uptake can, maybe it has a
heavier relationship on, uh, water demand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also your, your light intensity has to
be, uh, equally changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and this is more open-ended
too, but to say like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these limitations, like how I can
only do three irrigation events a day on
[SPEAKER_01]: my irrigation controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, can we even, is it even worth trying
to do P2s if you're only getting three
[SPEAKER_01]: events?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe we can't bulk our plants
properly and we don't want channeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, well, how do we,
first of all, the easy, like obvious thing
[SPEAKER_01]: would be, Hey, how do we get more events?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put an open sprinkler in or whatever
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe there's sometimes where you just
don't have that option, uh, or don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the capital, you know, and maybe that's a
bad, uh, a bad example, but you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, maybe it's a good thing we
can't bulk because we actually can't pull
[SPEAKER_01]: that much moisture out of the room that,
you know, we, we don't have enough dehu to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull as much water that we're putting into
the room out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an infrastructural thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or we just have too many strains in
one irrigation zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to water too many different
strains all the same way because we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to have this much variety, but we don't
have that much control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, and, and you still see
cultivations that have like multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of flower in the same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen it recently and it kind
of shocks me still, but, um, to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, Hey, we have one room, so we have to
keep the environment the same for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and all stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only things we can change is
irrigation strategy and nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even potentially nutrient inputs,
but if you have one or two batch tanks for
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole room, you know, there's little
like nuances to this stave, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the height of each stave and the
barrel at each time, uh, it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting to dive deeper into the
specific dynamics of relationship between
[SPEAKER_01]: one, one stave to another over leveling
the whole equalizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we're, we're looking at a
sound board and we're trying to equalize
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot because yeah,
just cutting it all off at that one stave
[SPEAKER_00]: may not actually be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, if it is maybe that only
two other staves need to be lowered in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for you to continue to operate at an
op, uh, an option, optimal output,
[SPEAKER_00]: then, um, you should probably do that
rather than limiting everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if by limiting everything else,
you're also either reducing quality or
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity or, um, um, potentially,
uh, inviting other issues like mold or
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew or other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so yeah, that's a very,
the nuances are, are extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, those are also subjective for the
facility that you're looking at or for the
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown situation that you're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like one of the biggest things
that I see home growers struggle with if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just growing in a tent is,
um, their exhaust versus intake and the
[SPEAKER_00]: positioning for those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if the tent needs to go hotter,
then you need to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling hot air in and putting it in at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it needs to go cooler, you need to
pull cool air in and put it in at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it can come down over the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like little tiny nuances
that you, um, you can optimize,
[SPEAKER_00]: but definitely need to know the situation
that you're facing, um, in order to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so after, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after, uh, you kind of went into
the Colorado market market, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: have you, uh, remained in the Colorado
market since you moved there from,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Cureleaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I moved here in 2020, got involved in
the commercial, uh, indoor cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: then, and, uh, and I left the last
facility that I was operating in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in January of last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so ever since, so I, the two
facilities that I operated in that I ran
[SPEAKER_01]: here, um, one, you know, both in Denver,
both relatively small, um, very different
[SPEAKER_01]: environment between the two, but,
uh, long story short is I left due to a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was the company selling the facility,
um, you know, financial issues within the
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then just other opportunities that
presented themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started working as the sort of a
technical advisor and sales person at
[SPEAKER_01]: Science LED in September of 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so for several months I was running
the facility, uh, and I was working for,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the lighting company and we had,
you know, several different iterations of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of that was I was able to bring
on a couple of guys part time to help do
[SPEAKER_01]: the day to day cultivation operations
until the, um, we were able to get kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilized to an extent, which led to,
uh, some complications or conflicts of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest within, in money flowing in the
company, money, you know, kind of moving
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, without getting into too
much detail, there was a big sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: conflict between the current employer and,
you know, both employers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to kind of step away from the
garden and focus full time on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lighting company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then that's where I transitioned out of
full time commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and, um, since then, uh,
it sounds like you worked at Science LED
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, um, have also now transitioned
over to, uh, Arroyo, um, the, the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate and environmental monitoring
and, uh, data platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you talk a little bit about your
time there and, um, sort of what your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience has been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, you know, I also, I started my
consulting business in 2022, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: just due to a variety of things that were
introduced to me as opportunities to
[SPEAKER_01]: generate more revenue, bring some more
value, step out of the garden and into the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger picture of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all opportunistic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like referrals with certain companies that
were like, Hey, I know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you want to work with us in some
capacity, but not, you know, fully that
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics opportunities to, to potentially
create some genetics licensing deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or work with certain providers that I
trusted when other people asked,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, do you have a connection to a trusted
nursery that once tissue culture started
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more mainstream in the
preservation and cleaning of genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to establish some good
relationships there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was all these little pieces that
kind of flew, like fell together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, you know, sort of
negotiating, Hey, I have this entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to have an employment contract
with you full time while I also have this
[SPEAKER_01]: entity that I'm doing outside,
you know, working as long as there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, working at science was
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot about, uh, just the
mechanics of, of led lighting and diode
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing, uh, spectrum drivers,
the nuances on driver technology and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and diode technology and lensing and
optics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I had been using the,
um, EST tech fixtures, but I'd also rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we had fluence at, um, at cure leaf
and I had gotten some Gavita's and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, so I'd used a variety of
different LEDs and I had science LEDs in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, one of the facilities in one of my
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we got a rebate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rebates are really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado was really, you know,
doing well, giving out a lot of rebates
[SPEAKER_01]: direct cell energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw an opportunity there to leverage
my network and my connections and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I can probably get these lights into
more facilities and, and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, got some cool projects in,
but I really focused a lot on learning and
[SPEAKER_01]: advising and helping them with their
growers because I had replaced the guy who
[SPEAKER_01]: had previously been doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there he'd moved on to another job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, there was a lot to learn
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of, uh, living soil producers
indoors and greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of guys that were producing
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, a lot of solvent lists that
really liked the dynamic spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: very small scale, small batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also had like planet 13 and we
had, um, some bigger facilities and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were working with a greenhouse
manufacturer with, uh, one of the larger,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, see like breeding research facilities
and commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there was a lot of interesting
distribution of, uh, of resources in that
[SPEAKER_01]: company towards different markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and I really actually enjoyed and
appreciated kind of taking a step outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis to going to some of these
research conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got to go to NCRA 101,
which is a conference, which is a state of
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry conference for controlled
environment, agriculture from vendors to
[SPEAKER_01]: university professors, to private
research, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, you know, a couple of,
uh, non cannabis related research
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences and just general conferences,
which was really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause I was also really interested and
still am in kind of branching out outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the decision to go to Aroya.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Aroya is working, uh, working with
one of the largest raspberry producers in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world and using some of our technology
to help grow raspberries and substrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to a much higher yield and,
and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go too deep into that,
but, uh, that was really fascinating to
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of the cross pollination of CEA and
cannabis, cannabis can sometimes be for
[SPEAKER_01]: the CEA guys, a black box or like,
we don't want to get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's legal issues with research,
but then there's a lot of innovations and
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to leverage new technology and
cannabis that isn't accessible to the CEA
[SPEAKER_01]: guys as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was interesting to watch those two
worlds kind of collide and walk in between
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, uh, I believe it was, uh,
uh, Ramsey Nubani, uh, I think he worked
[SPEAKER_00]: at Aroya for a while and, um, he's
provided some excellent information kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of circa the era that you're talking
about, where there was this, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: this push for controlled environment,
agriculture, knowledge, and applications
[SPEAKER_00]: to start to be used within the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, kind of vice versa by taking,
you know, this high ticket item,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, commodity item like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using some of those extra funds that
were, um, generated by its high ticket
[SPEAKER_00]: price to be put back into internal
research for some facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does seem like, um, you know,
like tomato growers have been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: using generative and vegetative steering
cues for vining tomatoes for decades and
[SPEAKER_00]: been using it successfully to produce,
um, you know, extremely highly productive
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, nutrient Lee, um, dense produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it only makes sense that something
else like cannabis with such a high
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient demand would benefit from the use
of, um, different, uh, steering cues and
[SPEAKER_00]: just different, um, different
horticultural practices that are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of reserved for food production or
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see these worlds sort of collide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I always point people towards plant
empowerment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to look into some of the more
refined practices and understandings of
[SPEAKER_00]: how plants act and respond to their
environment and their different inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because cannabis is just another plant
and it is going to do a lot of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that other plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we typically put it up on this
pedestal in the cannabis community as
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that it's this magical,
uh, special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it does have some really unique
qualities, but in the end, it is just a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a water pump, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just putting water from the ground
out into the air and, uh, assimilating
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding that a lot of plants are
like that is, I feel that it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: demystifies, but also opens up an avenue
for people to look into different,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, aspects of controlled environment,
agriculture, or other horticultural or
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural research that is,
um, it can be applied and it can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for the benefit of the cannabis community,
uh, especially as growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think a large amount of the
resources to that end are being invested
[SPEAKER_01]: in lighting from what I observed,
um, in terms of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, research ag, obviously breeding and
genetics is a big part of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but what I was mostly interested
at science was learning a bit about some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the, uh, spectrum research on plant
growth and sharing that cause that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: very under, uh, not very well understood
aspect of cannabis production
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, but just plant production in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluence did a good job of doing a lot of
research on far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's been a lot of studies that
have come out on different impacts of red
[SPEAKER_01]: at different times of the day,
whether that's actually effective or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's, you know, versus 640 nanometers
versus 660 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's all these specific nuances
that you can get into with lighting and
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum and timing and whether it
actually helps or not, what cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: what varieties, uh, respond better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that was one of the things that I
was most interested in, but I did see that
[SPEAKER_01]: was quite a big topic of conversation and
irrigation still is a, is a large,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, nutrient assimilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugby did a big study on phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many, um, different
approaches within the CEA space to what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying to do research to figure
out how to get better produce,
[SPEAKER_01]: better quality produce, better nutrient
density in their produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, more yield, uh, more hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, as the climate changes
and evolves, a lot of the CEA guys are in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're figuring out like using tools
like Koidra to manage the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the autonomous, um, the grower
challenge that they, they usually win.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you know, there's a lot of
different facets to it, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to see, well, Hey,
AI and machine learning in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, are making their way into cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bit of, uh, gripping that's
going on where people want to hold onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the reins and think that they can
outperform the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they probably can in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in other cases, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but that's been a huge topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was at Cultivate last year and that
was a huge topic of conversation within
[SPEAKER_01]: flower producers and whatnot is like using
these you know, machine learning tools or
[SPEAKER_01]: these AI imaging devices like
hyperspectral imaging or RGBs to predict
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth and yield and plant health
and pest problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's hasn't been enough of an
assimilation of data to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: cohesively make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's learning on its own as it goes,
which I think is really cool and shows
[SPEAKER_01]: promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Arroy is working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some other companies working on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, there's a, there's a
huge difference in culture between CEA and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in terms of growers and who,
you know, ego and value and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least that's from what I've
observed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I could be wrong, but I've just
noticed there's a, um, intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property is huge in cannabis, even though
a lot of it's just around people checking
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, it just, things operate
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Values are just different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would say then that there's a lot more
ego driven decision making in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: than there is, uh, in controlled
environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's definitely still some on
in the CEA space, but there's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of, uh, university research
that translates into relationships with
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers and producers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of the cannabis research,
I think people there's two sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people who really appreciate it
and, and, and look to, uh, implement what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're seeing in the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are people who don't believe it
or don't like, you know, understand it
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe, um, and, and don't, don't see the
value as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a huge impact from the,
uh, legacy culture for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_01]: term of the sort of covert operations and,
uh, you know, the, the, the quietness of
[SPEAKER_01]: the innovation and, um, proprietary nature
to the, you know, cannabis growers that is
[SPEAKER_01]: still just prohibition behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, like there's a lot
of conversation around, Hey, we used to
[SPEAKER_01]: have much better turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We each have much louder weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have, you know, people say all
kinds of things on that end, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably true in a lot of cases,
but we have to understand like,
[SPEAKER_01]: why exactly is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we have to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, what do we, what, um, bridge do we
have to gap to be able to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there fundamentally a conflict directly
correlating between production,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like high, like production strategy,
uh, that is at a sort of a, this is like
[SPEAKER_01]: an open ended question too, but at an
absolute between quality, small batch
[SPEAKER_01]: craft and like volume production,
I've seen some really good quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, really, uh, really loud flower
coming out of some larger facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so there's, there's,
I think there's a, it's a bit of a gray
[SPEAKER_01]: area, but I'm, I'm, I'm curious what you
think on that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that like with the,
like the legacy market and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're because of the
prohibition era mentality, like you talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about and the, you know, there's a lot of
unwillingness.
[SPEAKER_00]: To share information and a lot of it,
I believe is due to, um, the penalties
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have been faced to share that
information openly and potentially be tied
[SPEAKER_00]: to that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, like people like Tom
Alexander, who, uh, did send some eotips
[SPEAKER_00]: way back in the seventies and eighties,
he, he was a bold pioneer to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: put that information out there and tie his
name to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, you know, it's almost unheard
of in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe five or six people that were doing
that and openly admitting that it was them
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so when you get caught up in a
mentality of this works for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you get pushed into a market
that, um, you know, every last little
[SPEAKER_00]: resource counts because you are starting
to see a loss in price and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase in overall production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to stay unique in your ways
and you don't really want to change
[SPEAKER_00]: because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, in general, change is scary
for a lot of people, and especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been doing something for a really
long time, changing is going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: much harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I, I feel like that is one of the
pitfalls of some of the legacy growers is
[SPEAKER_00]: not being willing to adopt, uh,
not necessarily wholesale change,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But little things that could implement
that they could implement to make their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, precision irrigation,
uh, environmental monitoring, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't necessarily change what you do or
put into your plants or how you grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: or the environment that you're giving
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives you more tools and insights
into the applications of those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I, it is a, it's a very,
I feel like touchy subject, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: within the overarching cannabis community,
because there are a lot of legacy growers
[SPEAKER_00]: who were pulled into this market because
of their expertise at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically before that,
they were forced to change with the market
[SPEAKER_00]: as it's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's through, uh,
you know, their own choice of wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay vibrant and, uh, have, have their
potential grow with the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people that are just
stubbornly stuck in their ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of, I know I'm going kind
of on, on the extremes of both ends of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum there, but, uh, it could fall
anywhere in between that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it does seem like it was
something that it was hard for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those who did, did great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those who didn't maybe still did great
for a while, but eventually they started
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the tides kind of turn on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The attitude of like constantly trying to
learn and get better and innovate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a lot of, uh,
discussion around people switching back to
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS lighting because they got better
quality or, you know, better, better
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, whatever the case may be that
they're saying, Hey, I'm going back to
[SPEAKER_01]: hand watering and organics and liquids
and.
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS lights, the way I used to do it versus
like, you know, driving new genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: material coming out of these new
environments where you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting under your selection pressure
comes from the environment that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's representative of your,
of your high production environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a, there's a, there's a give
and take there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, to me, I would, I would look
to like innovations that are not like
[SPEAKER_01]: taking a step back is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as there's a, uh, a clear economic
outcome because it's, it's a business,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when I graduated high school in
2009, I felt like there was this peak in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, um, at least in California in the two
15 as well as the gray market where the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of product that was coming out of
like the Bay area and SoCal was at such a
[SPEAKER_00]: peak that I can understand looking back at
that and saying, man, this, the weed then
[SPEAKER_00]: was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was knock you on your socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I was, you know, a much less
educated and knowledgeable individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, um, one thing my partner
says all the time is as we learn more,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know so much less, you know,
and it's like by, by gaining all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge now in the cannabis industry of
the different styles of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, you know, probably a million
plus different cultivars that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, normal amounts of people are consuming
on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, all, just all that, uh,
sort of compounding information provides
[SPEAKER_00]: almost this dilution effect of,
well, what is quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we know that we have individual
and unique endocannabinoid systems that
[SPEAKER_00]: respond differently to different
cannabinoids, as well as the different
[SPEAKER_00]: like terpene, ester, and other volatile
organic compounds, uh, as they coalesce
[SPEAKER_00]: together and we're responding to them
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, uh, an ibuprofen where you
have, you know, one single ingredient
[SPEAKER_00]: that's affecting your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a myriad of ingredients that are
affecting your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe when there were five
popular strains available to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you knew that one of them worked way
better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now when you have 40, 50, 60 different
strains available at one dispensary and 10
[SPEAKER_00]: to 20 different dispensaries within
driving distance, all holding a different
[SPEAKER_00]: menu, how can you even tell what's going
to work for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go through, you know,
hundreds of different strains in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time that you could five, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have constantly changing menus as
well, because the production is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: greater now than it was 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just, it's a, it's a completely
different market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to say that there was a better,
you know, to have rose colored glasses and
[SPEAKER_00]: look in the past and say, that weed was
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't, you know, I, I, I've smoked
some of the tastiest weed in my life in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past couple of years, but I still
remember the stuff from 10 or 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, cause it made an impression on me,
but I'll remember the stuff from this year
[SPEAKER_00]: and last year, the same, because it's also
a lasting impression.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've recently, you know,
I've done, I've judged some competitions
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've tried some, you know,
interesting unique flavors and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of, of similarities and
a lot of the varieties that are out now
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in commercial production,
especially because the market demands a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the similar flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get, yeah, what you're getting at
is, is important to point out,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is that there, and this is,
this is partially beneficial to like in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, legalization and the,
in, you know, sort of advent of private
[SPEAKER_01]: research within the industry as we're able
to understand what makes, what are the,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the factors that makes a quality
experience or at least like quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product and its effect on every individual
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we, it's so daunting to try to say,
Hey, I'm going to figure out what strain
[SPEAKER_01]: works the best for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, we have to understand why
and what those mechanisms are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, every person is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, just like your digestive system
is different than mine and certain foods
[SPEAKER_01]: aggravate me that don't aggravate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, or vice versa,
like that's sort of, uh, I look at it in
[SPEAKER_01]: similarly to that, which is, it all starts
with the base material and like how that's
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated, like what are the practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you remove all of those factors,
like contamination risks and poor storage
[SPEAKER_01]: and poor curing process or whatever it
might be there, then you get down to like
[SPEAKER_01]: the raw material input and how that
affects you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's a hard place to get to,
to try to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think that there's just this like
wide world of, of understanding,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, so many different factors of the,
of the plant, um, that yeah, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the production pieces is also just a small
portion of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then also, you know, one of the
things that I feel like it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: swept under the rug when people are asking
for the different cultivar that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: them is the understanding of, you know,
within the cultivation market,
[SPEAKER_00]: currently you can't have something that
yields the same grow for 12, 13,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 weeks and remain, um, viable,
uh, for, for a commercial facility where
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them are, uh, maybe pushing 10
weeks at the very most for a lot of their
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so anytime that you push past that,
you can't then ask for that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: money, uh, per unit being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, typically, um, maybe for some really
high quality, uh, product, but in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, when people are saying,
I wish that there was a really good sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market, because I know that that
worked really well for me when I had it
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, like I said,
a 14 week Ecuadoria or GMO or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, just not commercially
viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it, you don't see a lot of people
growing GMOs like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on its own, like you'll see garlic cookies
or like, you know, burgers or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, cause they, they, they're shorter,
but they still get some of the similar
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors, but they're not just GMO anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's, you know, that's a,
that is a case of we are, um, we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: conform to market viability, which is a,
it could be potentially a sacrifice on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on, on, um, that specific cultivar and
the, the, the people who have had that
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you on that completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that like the reason that's part
of the reason I think Sour Diesel like was
[SPEAKER_01]: so strong, uh, and so popular for,
for a while back in like 2008,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2009.
Um, Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the co-founders of the Craft
Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he goes by Gabby Staten Island and he
was one of the guys that brought Sour
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel over from New York back in the
early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, people are,
people will still, you know, demand it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelves, but it, you know,
from a cultivation perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: when, uh, you look at it as a cultivation,
cultivation to buyer relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: selling big fluffy green buds,
it makes me sick to my stomach as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator, trying to see that in a bag
and try to go and shop that around because
[SPEAKER_00]: the expressions you're going to get from a
lot of people are going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you the dumbest motherfucker that just
walked through my door today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it's really unfortunate
because then when people see that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: available, they want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, there is this huge
disconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like with just across the board
when it come, you know, at all different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels from cultivator to purchaser to
retailer to consumer, and there needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit more of a holistic
approach in bringing more knowledge there
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for someone more intelligent
than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the problem, but I have no
avenue for rectifying that at this point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, social media is a double edged
sword in that regard because social media,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially Instagram, which is where a lot
of the cultivators are, uh, is pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smell, you know, you can't smell
weed on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we've leaned further into
like, uh, this conflation of quality with
[SPEAKER_01]: bag appeal, um, that, that we never used
to have before.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like a thing, you know,
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think there's a big,
that has a big role to play to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, education and teaching people what
like teaching consumers, what quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I deal with this with my family,
like elderly, uh, family members who are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in trying cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like my parents, even,
or, you know, my cousins or whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like weeds too strong for me these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just get way, way too, way too
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to try to find strains that
work for me or I want low potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: weak weed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have these ideas in their heads
around like what they want and need out of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but they just can't figure out
how to get it or how to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there's this like mindset of like,
I don't want this high potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: high THC weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, that's still talking
about THC where, whereas it's more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, yes, that number could
potentially impact how high you get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but to a certain point,
like there's some, um, there's some,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some factors there where testing
fraud or whatever, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many things we could talk about
there, but I would just say like for some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna need to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some of those guys who are looking
for product that's going to make them feel
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they want to feel off of smoking,
there's so much out there and there's very
[SPEAKER_01]: little resources to help them figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you go rely on your bud tender
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I feel like it's why I am such a
huge advocate for home grower rights,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like that's going to be one
of the best routes that any individual can
[SPEAKER_00]: take into trying to find what'll work for
them, especially if they have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and readily known cultivars in
their area, because then they can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they can try it out at home,
compare it to what's at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they think that they like what they do
better, then they can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe spend a little bit more on a pack of
seeds or on a really nice cultivar or
[SPEAKER_00]: something and set up two small spaces,
even one, just to keep that cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: around, learn about cloning and
propagation, because that's also a blast
[SPEAKER_00]: in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also be able to grow that product
that they want and desire, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: steadily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, but it is a, you know,
when you, when you are sifting through all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different iterations of even,
you know, like, let's just say something
[SPEAKER_00]: like Girl Scout cookies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Girl Scout cookies at every
dispensary in some iteration in every
[SPEAKER_00]: state that has a market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe there's going to be a few
degrees of difference in some,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in others, there's going to be,
you know, a hundred different degrees of
[SPEAKER_00]: separation and it's going to be vastly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it, it, the commercial space is,
um, it has a lot of refinement,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of, um, I've heard a lot
of people say that Girl Scout cookies in
[SPEAKER_01]: some way or another killed quality weed,
um, because it was like, it made the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple candy, um, you know, purple candy
gas or purple candy kind of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: craze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take over everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all everyone's growing in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all like, it's like,
oh, like it totally ruined the creativity
[SPEAKER_01]: and breeding and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, I, I see the
point there, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it, it, it is what it is for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it does well in a lot of conditions
and it performs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and I think that the original
Girl Scout cookies was not really a great
[SPEAKER_01]: production strain.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the form cutter, the thin mints
cutter, whatever, like they're not great
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and they're not really purple
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're, they're kind of that,
like, uh, you know, speckled green and
[SPEAKER_00]: purple with, with nice orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, you know, it's a beautiful
cultivar, but, um, I remember getting like
[SPEAKER_00]: the packs that were in the Bay area in
2009 and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of the best smoke that I can
remember to this day, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: no one wanted it at the time at when it
first came out because it was weird and
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were looking at these tiny
little nugs and they're going,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I just give me some sour diesel or
something, or some super silver haze or
[SPEAKER_00]: some blue dream, because I want to see
like one big Cola in the bottom of my zip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm getting a, when I'm getting
announced, you know, I don't, I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: all those different little popcorn nugs,
but it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it has staying power for a reason,
just like lemon cherry gelato,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, um, I feel like there's just too many
to name off now where there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all considered these elite cuts
or, you know, uh, commercially viable cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that do well in, you know, a variety of
different markets, but that was the same
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was, you know, 20, 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, those markets were much
smaller and the, the cuts were only passed
[SPEAKER_00]: around to a few people, but those few
people provided for a majority of those
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it was just, the product was
better known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the breeding world is probably the
final frontier of unadulterated creativity
[SPEAKER_01]: in the craft growing world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, being able to select strains and make
new crosses that are new flavors and just
[SPEAKER_01]: really try to like hone in what your goals
are and what, and, and have this,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not always going to be,
you know, predictable outcomes with
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're just, if you're really
breeding for a real purpose, that's one,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one, like, like a true economic
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey, we're building this cultivar
that's going to have these qualities and
[SPEAKER_01]: these things for production, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I also think genetic preservation
and looking at like creating combinations
[SPEAKER_01]: of flavors and selecting things that are
more out of, more for the, the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: that really appreciates, uh, interesting
depth and uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a cultivar is about pretty much all we
have left because everybody really is
[SPEAKER_01]: growing very similarly nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are growing in small
substrate with high EC, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: precision irrigation strategies,
high up, you know, reasonably high PPFD
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs, like not crazy, but like,
you know, there's a lot of similar
[SPEAKER_01]: practices that are successful in the
commercial space that can still produce
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not a lot of creativity left
within that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of that is the sacred is
left for like, you know, some of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, more well-known breeders who have a
reputation for putting out new quality hot
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and it also feels like, because some
people will kind of say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what about organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like what about having some sort
of commercial facility that runs an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my retort would be, well, all of these
organic systems that have been found to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in an, in an indoor setting,
um, are also very homogenous across,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you take a large enough
sample size, um, that it's all running,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these, these fabric beds with,
uh, something like a blue mat strip system
[SPEAKER_00]: or even other irrigation systems and,
uh, substrate monitoring so that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting your same target drybacks and wet
dry cycles and making sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical conductivity still isn't
getting too out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, all of these practices kind of
then steer back to this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment, agriculture
conversation that is already a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: refined practice, uh, and can be applied
through a variety of substrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient inputs, uh, environmental,
uh, control abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just, you know, I've,
we keep on circling back to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just about making sure that
you're optimizing where you can and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not, um, you're not overdoing it where
you can't afford to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, simplicity is oftentimes,
uh, much more rewarding, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, than getting like lost in the sauce
on, I want to need the nano bubbles and I
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do, you know, I need to default on
day 21 and it, you know, just having these
[SPEAKER_01]: like precise boundaries that you're
sitting within the, it's, it's a dynamic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think like the creativity that comes
from exploring new flavors is all we can
[SPEAKER_01]: have left and hold onto that we can do
ourselves in a lot of the, in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can go into my basement and take a
male this and a female then cross
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's not very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can get some really cool,
unique, new expressions and flavors based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the genetic potential of each of those
cultivars, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can, I can still do that and find
something that nobody else has in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I, but like, you know,
there's these guys out there now doing
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic and organic combination where
they're feeding base salts and adding in,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not really reinventing the wheel
or doing anything new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, Hey, I'm putting this kelp
fulvic acid combo through a separate doser
[SPEAKER_01]: in line after my batch tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can still deliver these microbes in
these bio stimulants to my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get what I think is creating an
increase in flavor profiles and expression
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, there is a science to the
biomechanisms behind adding those
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds into the plant and the chelators
and the biological organisms and enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a lot of depth to that
argument and to that style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I understand like, okay,
Hey, this is a new way of applying that
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy that we were doing in our batch
tanks and barrels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we were doing all this stuff and
keeping our lines clean still,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like kind of adapting in,
you know, these old school practices to
[SPEAKER_01]: new school production methodologies,
which I even don't even like using those
[SPEAKER_01]: terms, but like, you know, the legacy
versus the modern practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that part of it is very
limited in what we can, uh, what we can
[SPEAKER_01]: explore in terms of dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, veg time, pot size, planting
densities, like very, very myopic
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions that you make that could have
substantial outcomes on expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I recently walked into a facility
where, where someone was growing in one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots and vegging for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really, really felt like root
circling and constraining of, of space in
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone drove a more desirable
outcome on bud structure and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and density and what he was looking for
from his buds over years of his trial and
[SPEAKER_01]: error and experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his, that was where he got to in
his decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were growing in these large plants
in these plastic one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, like if you're not,
um, you have to do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make a lot of adjustments to
like fulfill the outcome of your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your specific decision on your
observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many, many confounding factors,
but people have unique things and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to work around that and all the
other aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your irrigation strategy has to change a
lot when you're, when you have too small
[SPEAKER_01]: of a, you know, maybe not too small,
but when you have a really small pot or
[SPEAKER_01]: the big plant, you, it's hard to just go
full generative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but some strains respond really well
to that and others don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, yeah, like cause sometimes we'll
categorize like the different cultivars as
[SPEAKER_00]: being like generative balanced or
vegetative themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and then trying to match
those with your environmental cues and
[SPEAKER_00]: your irrigation cues to try and optimize
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, uh, over-vegging your plant,
providing some sort of girdling,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a stressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to provide some sort of
generative responses, doing something to
[SPEAKER_00]: the morphology of the flower that is
desirable, but, um, it, it seems like a
[SPEAKER_00]: long walk, you know, to get to the end
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if it works, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to discredit,
uh, the different, uh, methods that people
[SPEAKER_00]: will use that they've developed over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you're saying what this
probably single or multi multi cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, growing style that they use for this
because it works and they've found that it
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, like we've also
discussed previously that could eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: become a hindrance if some new strategy or
technology or, uh, option becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the cultivation facility that
you then are either, uh, too stubborn to
[SPEAKER_00]: change because of a single method that you
must keep to make it your growing style,
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep your uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, you know, that's a
little ego driven at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, you know, I, it, there is a
balance there and especially as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a consultant knowing that,
you know, some people are just going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in their ways and it's about
optimizing their ways rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing optimal ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a, I, I've faced that issue as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a hard one to get used to,
especially when you see and have seen so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different styles that you can kind of
formulate a, you know, if you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: education and understanding of how and why
plants react to certain things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see a variety of ways that people
implement those different things to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: how the plant reacts, you can pick and
choose what works the best because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have your anecdotal model set
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're boom, ready to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when other people are faced with
that model that you set up for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they say, well, this doesn't work for my
setting because I wanted to do it this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put this in place,
it ruins everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I've, I faced that it's,
it's a, it's one of those things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like is, is a pitfall for,
um, people who want to enter into
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting where they're trying to maybe
push their own ideologies too much and
[SPEAKER_00]: not, uh, hear what the people need and
responding to those needs better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many flavors of, of,
uh, advising or consulting that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes down to like, you know,
what we're trying to do here is achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: desired outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we work backwards from our
desired outcome towards what we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: what our day to day is and get slightly
more myopic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the, in the very beginning,
you have to take a holistic, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to treat the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just go like, yes, you have to
stop the bleeding and put a bandage on it
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're, we're talking about like
holistic health, you know, like our whole
[SPEAKER_01]: system is flawed where we're not eating
well, we're not sleeping well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not, you know, all these things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're hijacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a garden, you're looking at the
holistic aspect, you're looking at what
[SPEAKER_01]: are the key dysfunctions of this
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we work backwards to the specific
production things that are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you can look at trends and
see things, but it's not always the best
[SPEAKER_01]: idea to just go, okay, we're going to
switch the one gallon pots at nine plants
[SPEAKER_01]: under a light at like, you know,
10 day vet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't just go directly to those
things without a true understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue generation in the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the key factors that move the
needle for the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you have to look at that first and
then go, well, how do these things all
[SPEAKER_01]: play?
[SPEAKER_01]: Into this, right at every step of the,
you know, efficiency is always really
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but efficiency isn't the whole
picture, you know, I mean, you gotta make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that the person feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that translates into like desire
to make change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from it, it's easy to look at like
the consulting thing as like a rose
[SPEAKER_01]: colored glass kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, I'm here to try to help,
you know, what are you really doing to
[SPEAKER_01]: support this person?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what your outcome based decisions
and value based, we're trying to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: value to the company in a way that's
supportive, that empowers them to drive
[SPEAKER_01]: success in the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other approach is I'm taking a piece
of this and I'm going to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: performance out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so that's where my incentive is,
is to like take my SOPs, my strategies,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of my, uh, you know, the way that I do
things and I'm going to place it in this
[SPEAKER_01]: facility and I'm going to get it to
perform the way that I want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get the, uh, the upside of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different approaches and it
doesn't all, it's not all applicable
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people really just need somebody to
bounce ideas off of, or to just tell them
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're doing something that doesn't
make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people want you to just step in
and run everything for them and do it all
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every business has this gradient of like
involvement and empowerment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, when you're taking a
whole holistic systematic approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to look at like, what is the
foundation of this company and the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it owner operator?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, uh, you know, somebody trying to
sell this or they, what are they trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and how do we change incrementally
change practices and procedures and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot to like back our way into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe like there's this potential
rollout of capital expenditure that needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we deal with a lot of consultants at
Arroyo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of consultants that come in
and say, Hey, I need to get Arroyo in this
[SPEAKER_01]: grow so that I can see what's happening so
that I can help make decisions and make
[SPEAKER_01]: changes and help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's a very common thing in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, people step in,
they implement their tools that allow them
[SPEAKER_01]: to do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can, you know, functionally
make a, a pull a bigger lever there
[SPEAKER_01]: without, without as much of a time or
labor investment on their end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I see the, there's a,
there's such a wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are like, we're taking our brand
into this grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put our, we're going to
take these two flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to run them our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do what our, do our thing
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to bring our brand in and
we're going to sell the brand from those
[SPEAKER_01]: two, sell the product in our brand from
those two rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like, you know, there's such a
wide scope of, of consulting type,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, I guess business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's also very challenging when
you have to, and I've, I've had this
[SPEAKER_01]: personal experience with clients who
didn't get the out, the results that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were looking for, cause they didn't put in
the time and the effort in the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or they didn't pay, you know,
or, or like, it's like, if you don't pay,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't listen to someone's advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, if you don't have any skin in
the game, you know, uh, and if it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: asking, getting advice that maybe isn't as
helpful as, or writing out someone's SOPs
[SPEAKER_01]: or writing out an IPM protocol for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they don't do it or stick to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two sides of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like either you need to put somebody
in there who can or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what am I willing to actually do here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how much involvement am I willing to
actually have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and do I actually see a potential
positive outcome here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I, when I'm going to help this
person, am I actually going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, let me, let's be real here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be really realistic is what I'm
offering and what I can, what I have the
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities and capacity to do is,
is this really going to help this person?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is it really going to make a
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, to me, I'm, I'm,
I'm at a point where I don't really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that much consulting unless I really
like the people and really have trust and
[SPEAKER_01]: respect and know like, this is a
relationship that's positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you really touched on it when you
said trust, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like in, in, uh, even in,
uh, a non-consulting, uh, setting,
[SPEAKER_00]: like let's say you're an employee for a
producer, um, as the producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to trust your employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the employees, you have to trust
those, uh, that are hiring you,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in, in the direction that's being
given as well as the effort that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: put into those directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when then translating
that to a consultant and, uh, client
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, the, the trust that needs to
be there needs to be something that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, precedes the application of these
different, um, methods and SOPs and
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they, if they don't trust that,
you know, what you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're not going to want to
implement it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't implement it,
or if they partially implement it and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the consultant are saying, okay,
here's the results that we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing when you implement my, my recipe
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you're not seeing those results
and they're going, well, we listened,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then that's where I can see a lot of,
um, frustrations around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the other thing that I
would like to emphasize where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, unless you have these different
abilities to monitor and then
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, uh, of how to interpret the
different data that's being generated by
[SPEAKER_00]: these different monitoring apparatuses so
that you can be like, Oh, this tank
[SPEAKER_00]: emptied at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the dry back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that there wasn't hand water then
when that was the standard, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: saw that the volumetric water content
dropped below a specific point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, we didn't know that the tiny
grand drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I, I, I like that,
that David uses that term artifacts and
[SPEAKER_01]: the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're like, you have to have enough
relevant world experience to know what to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for and what trends typically could
mean certain, uh, certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, to me, uh,
looking at data, it can be a double edged
[SPEAKER_01]: sword.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you don't necessarily know what to
look for always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're not trained, but also if you
are, you can get lost in the sauce and the
[SPEAKER_01]: data and just disappear down a rabbit hole
and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not actually really helping you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, uh, my optic to my optic and
getting in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when you get lost in the
data all the time, like you may notice
[SPEAKER_01]: things and, but the reality is,
is you, you make observations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and you validate those observations
with the data that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and so then there's, there's a
lot of, uh, conflicting potential problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could have that could reflect in
the same outcome in data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, having too heavy of a dry back
or having a VPD swing of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, our D he went down here or lights went
off and we sprayed here or whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: case may be that you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the decisions you're making are not
always live and die by, by the data,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does that, how do we like look at
the data objective?
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at the facility and the plants and
make correlations here that drive quicker
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions and outcomes to improvement in a
more efficient and effective, uh,
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and so that's why I think
it's really helpful for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: consultants to have more data and more,
more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but that's kind of, uh,
that's kind of a big challenge too,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it can be potentially limiting for,
uh, for some of these consultants who
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't always on site all the time,
who aren't always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they have to place somebody who's
got that skillset to be like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to go do all these things and
check out, you know, and then I'll look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this from a third party perspective and
make some, uh, make some recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it feels like there's a little bit
of a misnomer in the industry at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point right now, uh, based on what you
just said where, you know, there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there may need to be less data driven
decision making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more, um, uh, data supported decision
making where you're not just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the data and making a decision based on
that, but you need to, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the plants, see what they're
saying to you based on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their structure, their turgor,
their color, the, you know, are the pots
[SPEAKER_00]: actually drying back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a consistency across the crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are there inconsistencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those different things and then
look at the data and say, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I could tighten up this parameter a
little bit more, or I could change this,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and tweak this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I can see that based on
the data and these different trends that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going this way or that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen that before it's caused
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can make that educated change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, because sometimes you can look at
a nice, uh, pretty chart and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: think, Oh, everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you'll go into the room and
everything's not fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to then figure out what it is
that's causing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, yeah, sometimes I do believe
that there is like a tyranny of data where
[SPEAKER_00]: if you stick to the data and only the
data, then you're not going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you said, you're lost in
the sauce at that point and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking at, you know, are the
plants healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't look at the data anymore because
you're tricking yourself into thinking you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're chasing this, this, um,
nebulous kind of idea that you have that
[SPEAKER_01]: this one thing you're doing is making all
the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at, like I said, you get lost in
the sauce easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the, really the value of
onsite, you know, having somebody onsite
[SPEAKER_01]: to really, um, help be the eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's starting to be,
you starting to see these like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, Google glasses or these like,
you know, AI assisted technologies that
[SPEAKER_01]: allow you to look through the eyes of
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, in the facility that makes you be
able to, you know, potentially be more
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable offsite or again, back to the
hyperspectral imaging or RGB cameras,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, like it's assisted, you know,
it's assisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still making the decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still, and maybe the AI will start
driving those decisions in a way that's
[SPEAKER_01]: way superior to what we're able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you don't need those types of
people, but like, you know, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to really start to like define
what our value is in this space of
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to, to, to let the ego get
involved and say, oh, I'm better,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or I'm it's like, okay,
how do we make, as humans make objective
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions to, uh, to support people's
businesses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're, we're not just here to try to
be the best crops tier or be the best
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder or whatever, you know,
it's like, we, we want to, we want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry sustainable and have
longevity and have still have a degree of
[SPEAKER_01]: craftsmanship and, and care and pride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, that, that is, that is what
we're holding onto in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what allows us to, you know,
love and appreciate what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think that we have to,
to strike the balance between production
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue and just stewardship of,
of our, of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, man, you, you're really well
spoken in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you have a lot of experience and
I feel like your application of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: is up there with a lot of other people
that I've talked to that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: leading big changes in the industry to try
to make this sustainable future for those
[SPEAKER_00]: of us that are not necessarily in this for
some, uh, ego prize, but because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: so many uses for cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whether it be a medicinal use or
recreational use, uh, leisurely use,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, whether you're using some topical for
grandma's arthritis, or if you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, a giant one ounce joint to
set the party off, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a huge variety of
applications for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as cultivators, we are almost the
first line in this operation where we are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing, uh, what is going to eventually
be turned into this myriad of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, with all of your
experience, both in home growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cultivation and, um,
through all of these different avenues of
[SPEAKER_00]: optimization that you've taken,
um, for yourself, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest learning experiences that you've
had?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's take this as a two parter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be one of the biggest
learning experiences that you've had that
[SPEAKER_00]: was due to a setback?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was one of the biggest learning
experiences you had that was due to a
[SPEAKER_00]: success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, um, the setback piece we've
encountered, you know, I've encountered
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple situations with setbacks that
were both, um, eyeopening and
[SPEAKER_01]: disheartening at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, dealing with hoplite and
viroid once we understood what it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: was, uh, we made an executive decision to
clear house in our mom and in our mom room
[SPEAKER_01]: and reset our, uh, because everything was
so heavily infected that, uh, our
[SPEAKER_01]: production volume was going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was before I really knew best
practices to mitigate that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were victims of the, um, I guess
ignorance of hoplite and viroid until it
[SPEAKER_01]: was too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, bringing in genetics from outside
sources that you don't trust fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was a double edged sword because
we also got russet mites from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, from that, uh, till that clone order.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some of the best cultivars that
we had, but we got it from somewhere that
[SPEAKER_01]: was not necessarily, um, I guess,
uh, reputable, uh, back then, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there were not a lot of reputable options
that had really good variety and
[SPEAKER_01]: uniqueness and things that were not out in
the market fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a naive decision that I made
that I, you know, wouldn't say that I
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily fully regret because I learned
a lot about how to manage hoplite and
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid, how to get rid of russet mites,
but also like when to stop, when,
[SPEAKER_01]: when, when it's time to, uh, to reset and,
and like, what is the point of critical
[SPEAKER_01]: mass and no return and then never letting
yourself get back to that point again,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward, if you can help it,
you know, when you have a problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: that gets so out of hand, uh, that you
have to make a huge sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, um, that was a, that was a low
point, but also a big learning curve for
[SPEAKER_01]: me where I just, I really understood like
incremental checks and balances and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding like crop registration,
even down to that, like sanitary practices
[SPEAKER_01]: with shears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helped me manage mold issues in the
garden too, cause it, I just took a much
[SPEAKER_01]: more systematic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I think that's a big part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that's kind of how I would
answer that question, uh, in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: setbacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the other side of that question
is, you know, how do you, how did I
[SPEAKER_01]: triumph from a success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think the successes,
a lot of them, there were definitely some
[SPEAKER_01]: successes in terms of product that we
produced quality and yield and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, in fact, I had some really good
runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, you know, to avoid the,
like, oh, the, you should have seen the
[SPEAKER_01]: fish that got away kind of story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think a lot of it came down to
like, I felt success with training people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I, I think that I've taken a lot of
pride in my ability to break things down
[SPEAKER_01]: and coach and train and educate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, what my first job ever
was a martial arts instructor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was an English teacher online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, so I've had a lot of jobs
and roles and experiences as a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, an educator, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, when I was working at
Curaleaf and bringing up a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time and just watching people,
uh, sort of take to things or how to,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone has a very different way of
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and I had a couple of guys that
moved on up and ended up in much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And learned a lot and applied themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, not to necessarily
credit myself for their success at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to be like, Hey, you know,
they have, uh, acknowledged that they
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be where they were without me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I've had some really
challenging problems with staff too,
[SPEAKER_01]: or people who felt undermined when I came
in or who felt like I maybe didn't have,
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't proved myself or hadn't,
hadn't succeeded in a certain way that
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed them to have respect for me,
which was a projection obviously of their
[SPEAKER_01]: own personal insecurities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to bridge that gap and like build that
trust and build those positive
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships to be, to a point where I
had a successful collaborative effort with
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who felt very much like I had
stepped on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, you know, through the work
and my efforts and my labor and my
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and everything, to like kind of
level with that person and give them
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities and then see them successful
on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that that's a success in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always so great to see, especially
when you are trying to approach it
[SPEAKER_00]: through, um, you know, not necessarily
learning that my method is best,
[SPEAKER_00]: but trying to teach people, um,
you know, like in industry standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: best practices, uh, or, um, even just some
basic understandings so that they can make
[SPEAKER_00]: more educated, uh, decisions themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to see them make those
decisions as you would have hoped for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really nice feeling because you,
you can start to see that your,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, style of education is not only
effective, but it is, uh, it's working
[SPEAKER_00]: real time live right there in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that's a huge, a huge feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've seen it a few times where I've
taught somebody something and then seen
[SPEAKER_00]: them implemented successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels really good to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see that that education is being,
uh, understood because sometimes I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I ramble and I feel like my,
my mind doesn't necessarily work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way that someone else's mind may
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my explanation of something might
just be, you know, too esoterically me to
[SPEAKER_00]: be applicable to their, their way of
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, you know, through this podcast
and even other conversations that I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: with people, it is, uh, it is definitely
helping to make a lot more of this
[SPEAKER_00]: information, um, accessible to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to make people like yourself or
myself or any of our other guests more
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible to the general community,
um, where now they'll see that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this level of education and understanding
where maybe they'll reach out to you with
[SPEAKER_00]: a question because they feel confident in
your ability because they've heard you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've heard your, your candor and your
understanding of these different topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like that's just such a huge
value to the community in general as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you hosting this podcast too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is really valuable to have,
you know, there's a lot of noise and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of negativity and there's a
lot of, uh, it's easy to get caught up in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of things in our industry because
it's, it's very turbulent, very
[SPEAKER_01]: tumultuous, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think spreading the word and
education from, not from a place of ego or
[SPEAKER_01]: authority or anything, just like,
Hey, we're just here sharing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, nobody's any better than I like
to, uh, I often like to use the term
[SPEAKER_01]: principles like guide, uh, guide a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you understand the core
principles of functionality of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of a system, um, or just a way of
thinking, then then you can always revert
[SPEAKER_01]: back to, uh, to that, that for the
fundamentals and the foundations of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of, uh, of problem solving and
troubleshooting and learning how to
[SPEAKER_01]: problem solve, learning how to objectively
make decisions that are based on
[SPEAKER_01]: principles is, is, is like the teach
Amanda fish thing in such an extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: degree.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like provide those foundations so that
they can build their own program,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own house, basically, rather than,
um, you know, providing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: prefabricated lumber and everything,
you know, you, you want to give them
[SPEAKER_00]: something solid to work from, but not
necessarily provide them the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, because it is, there's such a
uniqueness to how each individual wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate not only within the garden,
but within life that it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a cookie cutter and say,
just do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, yeah, I'm guilty of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted that for a long time to be like,
I just need the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want the, you know, like I want the
irrigation strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the, you know, whatever it might
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wanted the, the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wanted the myopic answer and it's
like, that doesn't really help,
[SPEAKER_01]: help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't help anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, you're trying to like fit this,
close this box on, um, the specifics,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we could go all day into like
specific crop steering strategies,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't think that really helps people
that much from my perspective of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't, you, you learn the nuances of,
of these very kind of, um, advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through a lot of your own trial and error
and experience when you're trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions based off of logic and
principles and, and that sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I, that's why I try not to get
too deep in the weeds on anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just find it to be less, less helpful
than, um, than talking about what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we've kind of already gone
over our, uh, predicted run time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start to try and wrap us,
wrap us up, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there, there's so many more questions that
I'd want to ask you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the future of the cannabis industry,
where you see it going, what do you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: is being like swept under the rug in the
cannabis industry now, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've touched on a lot of that
stuff kind of, uh, without it being direct
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout our conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one of the final wrap up
questions that I can ask is what advice
[SPEAKER_00]: would you give for new growth?
Yeah, I think I think that's a good
question.
I think, you know, if, if you,
if you're a cannabis person, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're one of the first cannabis growers
entering the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're not because you yourself
are not one of these, uh, old legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that has been doing this for 20
years and adapted with the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you kind of entered it at
a, you know, late stage, um, within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis game almost as it was going fully
recreational across, um, majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, maybe you could address this
for people wanting to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation industry or even those who
want to just get into growing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's some advice you would give for
new growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm going to start with values,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like be humble, be curious, use your
excitement to learn and kind of keep your
[SPEAKER_01]: self within the, like, it's easy to get
lost in the weeds, as I just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you're a new grower coming
in, find mentors, find people who really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand certain things that you want to
learn and diversify those things and like
[SPEAKER_01]: really try to, I think what helped me the
most when I first started working in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facility was that I just wanted
to do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to, I put in all its work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was work ethic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I just, I wanted to work in
every department.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to learn how to do all the things
and I wanted to be knowledgeable and
[SPEAKER_01]: useful and valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found the thing that I was really
good at, you know, whatever things those
[SPEAKER_01]: were that I was really good at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I dug into those and I made a
difference and made it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: measurable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think like just picking people to
learn from and picking opportunities that
[SPEAKER_01]: give you the most, the best education and
being constantly hungry and curious,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be the first one there and the
last one to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, that's something that you can't
learn from somebody is work ethic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always found that to be the most
valuable quality within my employees to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain extent was like, you could have
all the knowledge you want, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't just get out there and do what has
to be done, you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that your network and building
that network and meeting people and
[SPEAKER_01]: building relationships they have to go,
you can't necessarily do that on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: like above and beyond learning the skill
and having the core skills and core
[SPEAKER_01]: competencies, develop those core
competencies as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also take opportunities to build your
network and to meet people and to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and sound stupid and whatever,
you know, like just constantly remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: ego and be hungry and, and try really hard
to diversify and find mentors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, those are my best,
best bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's be hungry for information and open to
that information when it's given to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just if you're going to
apply it, apply it, assess it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't necessarily just take everything
for its face value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a lot of, um, what's the,
what's the term snake juice, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of, there's a lot of
misinformation and a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: bad information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being skeptical also, I feel like
would go hand in hand with what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying is, um, you know, take that
information and, but use some skepticism
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you're trying to apply it and,
and don't just take everything for what
[SPEAKER_00]: people are saying as being true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even if they sound good when they say
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, definitely don't, don't rush the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things I learned from
my early days in martial arts and
[SPEAKER_01]: competing and whatnot was like something
that my instructor and master always told
[SPEAKER_01]: me, which was like, you never really lose,
you know, you may lose a match or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but at the end of the day,
like you either win or you learn,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or you, you do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that's, uh, I think it's easy to
get disheartened and have the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, bruising of the ego and
whatnot and knowing it's time to walk away
[SPEAKER_01]: and when it's time to move on and move
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're not no longer being
served, I think I see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: still stagnate in the industry when
they're finding like, this job isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: serving me anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this, you know, I'm not learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just fall into complacency and just
stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, take risks, jump off and do
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you fail, you fail, but like,
keep trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I'm grateful for my,
um, opportunities that I was able to move
[SPEAKER_01]: into when I felt like certain places were
no longer serving me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I constantly built my network to
put myself in a situation to where I had
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities when they, when I needed
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, uh, um, dig the well before you
get thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've heard that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think that's a great,
a great little wrap up to our
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, of course, because this is a cannabis
podcasts, we do have a few ubiquitous,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cannabis related questions just to
wrap up as a sort of rapid fire finish to
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your favorite strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, there's just so many for different
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I think back to like my best
experiences on cannabis, it was probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, some of the old school hazes,
mango haze, um, you know, some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice hazy strains that,
that I had as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you grew up in Florida is what I
take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our weed was from California and,
uh, so I'm probably from New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mango haze might've been from your
neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some interesting haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had like, uh, we had a couple Florida
haze strains for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swamp boys seeds and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, you know, the followup to that
question is of course, who is your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite breeder of all time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, man, that's a, that's also a tough
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used to, I used to, I used to really
like DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think, I think most of the stuff
that I've had lately that I really liked
[SPEAKER_01]: has either come from like, um,
you know, seed junkie or like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, you know, even, uh, there's a,
there's a breeder here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, called loving in her eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really, really incredible,
incredible strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like that or like,
you know, I always really liked compound
[SPEAKER_01]: growing compound genetic strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were always the more fun ones to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wrapping up a very small hunt of,
um, the blueberry Rose from love and inner
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I love their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, their, their Instagram profile is
always so well curated in terms of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower pictures and the sort of
mystique to the, to the profile as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they don't even always tell you the
name of the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they're showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it gets you that much more
interested when it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these beautiful blues and reds and purples
and, uh, like deep Indigo's almost in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, their, their color spectrum that
they can produce out of their genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: library is astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was going to say there's a new,
a new, um, breeder in town here that is
[SPEAKER_01]: someone, if you're in Colorado to look out
for, which is Eleven's genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have some really cool crosses of old
school, like headbands and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that have some new, new flavors,
uh, kind of associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, you get these old school
flavors with some of the, uh, qualities of
[SPEAKER_01]: modern production that, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one that I really like some of
their strawberry adhesive is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what is your most memorable cannabis
related experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like as a kid or like, is this just
extremely open?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, it could be like your first
time smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, you know, that time you
almost got busted by the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've had a, a wide array of
answers for this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't pigeonhole yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I definitely, I would say in terms
of like best positive memory probably
[SPEAKER_01]: would be the first time I ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just listening to some music that
touched my soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I, and I did get, um,
I did get busted when I was in college for
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking in my dorm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was definitely extremely memorable
because I did kick me out of my dorms for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, uh, we, I lived in a suite with two
rooms and one of them was these two guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from the same town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one was me and my buddy from
high school and my buddy from high school
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really smoke, but the other two
guys did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a cold night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Hey, we should still,
we had this window behind the building
[SPEAKER_01]: that we usually climb out of to smoke
behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time they were like, no,
we don't want to climb out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to come out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll, you know, towel the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get the sploof out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll open the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll turn the fan on, do all the things
that we've forgot to cover the vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, like the, the shared room vents,
the vent that went into the hallway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the return vent pulled a lot of
that air in the room, out into the
[SPEAKER_01]: hallway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like within an hour or so,
the TA had called the cops and they banged
[SPEAKER_01]: on the door and we were watching like
James and the giant peach or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just so, so stoned and I heard
banging on the door and we ignored it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang, bang, bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally I get up, walk out of,
I was in the room with my suitemates and I
[SPEAKER_01]: walked out, they closed the door on me and
I was in the little like hallway between
[SPEAKER_01]: the two rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the door and I just see two cops
out there and I just heard one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: say, well, if they don't open up this time
we're going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I opened the door and, uh, there was a,
they were doing the whole good cop,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad cop routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like the little canine patches on
their, their shirts and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: threatening, bring the dogs in and search
my whole room and found this like tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: little nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming this was in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Orlando.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to say, I haven't heard that
level of, uh, militaristic style,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, approach to a college kid with weed,
uh, unless it was, you know, Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: across to Texas or something along the
Southern States there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were aggressive, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, yeah, it sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I had to do four things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, unfortunately, um, uh, I didn't get
arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get anything on my permanent
record, but that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in like probation on up for,
with the university for like two years
[SPEAKER_01]: after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew in that moment, I was like,
all right, they're kicking me out and
[SPEAKER_01]: start packing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is, those are both definitely
some memorable experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, Liam, thank you so much for
your time today and, um, having this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation and kind of going deep on a
few topics that we don't normally get to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on with, um, with other cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we do a lot of, uh,
home grow discussion and people who have
[SPEAKER_00]: just entered into the commercial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we rarely have people on with your
level of commercial experience and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, uh, of where this industry
has been and is going, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the past five to 10 years and moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really appreciate you being
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these conversations, as I like to say,
are how we spread this knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why the podcast is called the way
we grow, because this is how we grow as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community and as individual cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you hosting this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome to see that you're getting
some knowledge out to as many people as
[SPEAKER_01]: you can and bringing on a diverse array
of, of, uh, of speakers and guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's, uh, it's cool to see it's
inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep it up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
