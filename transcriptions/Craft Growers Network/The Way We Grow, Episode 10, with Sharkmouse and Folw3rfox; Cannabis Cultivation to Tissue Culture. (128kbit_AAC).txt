[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the way we grow podcast production of the
[SPEAKER_02]: craft growers network I'm your host Nick
wolf today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have two guests on They are
shark mouse and flower Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good good to hear I'm doing well myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just You know, it's been pretty busy at
the cultivation facility that I work at
[SPEAKER_02]: and We've just been trying to perfect
every little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great to have Some like-minded
perfectionists in the building talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about some some gross stuff today I'll be
honest not having had plants in the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: for a couple of months now I've I've
started I've started to get the itch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to talking shop for
sure For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know like right off the bat then
because it feels as though there's been
[SPEAKER_02]: some new stuff In your grow world lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you both talk about a little bit
of what you've been doing over the past
[SPEAKER_02]: few months and how you've slowly Taken
down the one big old flowering room and
[SPEAKER_01]: done something else with it So I Don't I
don't know how many of your viewers are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna gonna recognize me from a previous
iteration of what I did I'm shark most
[SPEAKER_01]: farms previously on Instagram and you
know, obviously my whole Thing was
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation education made accessible to
the average home grower, you know I like
[SPEAKER_01]: to take complex subjects and break them
down and distill them into actionable
[SPEAKER_01]: executable topics that we we were all
capable of going right now down into our
[SPEAKER_01]: tent or our grow room and and and
implementing and seeing seeing some
[SPEAKER_01]: progress and improvement in In our SOPs
over what we had been doing previously
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, as I'm sure all of us are
quite familiar with Instagram's Random
[SPEAKER_01]: decision-making processes when it comes to
what is and what isn't allowed as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: content My page went down without any
warning whatsoever it back in November
[SPEAKER_01]: with 92,000 followers And I had made the
decision after that had happened that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if it was unlikely that it'd be able
to Regain the same kind of momentum that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had hit a few years previously that
allowed me to grow to that stage and as
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately As as it was it felt like an
opportunity to to push myself a little
[SPEAKER_01]: further into something new into something
More sustainable from you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a social aspect and an educational aspect
Pardon me, but also feels like That's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the industry is heading and I've
always prided myself on trying to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cutting edge of of Where we were going
and where we were trying to be as as an
[SPEAKER_01]: industry as as a niche as the market so
Tissue culture felt like the next logical
[SPEAKER_01]: step And from a functional perspective,
it just felt like the right move to
[SPEAKER_01]: transition that one big flower room That
when it came down to it, you know just
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up producing flower for myself and
flower Fox on a personal level
[SPEAKER_01]: Transitioning that room into a micro
propagation and tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium lab where flower Fox can continue
to to cultivate Not only you know new
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes that we're getting from from,
you know Various breeders that we like to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with but also some of the tissue
culture samples that I'll be pulling out
[SPEAKER_01]: of my lab and it seems like a pretty
seamless transition to go from you know
[SPEAKER_01]: educating Like you had alluded to earlier
the the level of perfectionism that I like
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring to the table going from
cultivation to to Where I believe the
[SPEAKER_01]: market will end up being based on what
we're seeing today in in in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: into tissue culture And try and bring some
of you over with me earlier on in the game
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on right on and what about the on
the mycelium side of things So that's been
[SPEAKER_04]: something I've wanted to do for quite some
time I'm actually I'm very excited that
[SPEAKER_04]: he's turned it into a tissue culture lab
and I love watching and learning and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think it's a great step forward and like
it was absolutely unfortunate what
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram did But I think it was the
perfect time to have it and I was super
[SPEAKER_04]: excited for what's next I'm also very
happy that I get to use that space for
[SPEAKER_04]: mycelium This is something so new to me,
but it's something that I've wanted to do
[SPEAKER_04]: for a long time now I just didn't have the
proper space or environment to do it You
[SPEAKER_01]: also have previous experience with
mushrooms just not in not in a lab setting
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just tried to grow them in a tent
downstairs and I didn't have my
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures right, but I did enjoy it and
I got some gorgeous like huge great oyster
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms I did lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did turkey tail before So I did spend a
little bit of time last year doing that So
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited to continue on Yeah,
I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's kind of this dual functionality
where anything that you need to just use
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a septic technique you can kind of
just bust out the flow hood get right to
[SPEAKER_02]: it You already have your procedures in
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just a nice transition either We
can both use this space, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting Well, and and as you you just
mentioned is a lot of the SOPs are
[SPEAKER_01]: directly transitionable to to You know
both functions, which is nice to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to you know, if I'm if I'm implementing a
Specific D scrub technique for example
[SPEAKER_01]: that that I'll be utilizing for my tissue
culture The same thing will apply to to
[SPEAKER_01]: what what she's doing when entering the
room as well So there's there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: direct crossover.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of you know learning
opportunity on on both side to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross paths and and and pick up a new sort
of area of expertise if you will for both
[SPEAKER_01]: of us Which is always always nice to add
tools to the toolbox For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean Let's let's start at where
the toolbox started then and let's go back
[SPEAKER_02]: to What were some of your first
experiences with plants in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to you know, say sometimes cannabis
starts the journey into vegetables and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes it's Vegetables that you have
your first experience with with grandma or
[SPEAKER_02]: mom or dad or some relative or some friend
So where did cultivation start for both of
[SPEAKER_02]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well quite honestly Nicole's Flower Fox in
the expert When it came to plants long
[SPEAKER_01]: before I ever even showed showed,
you know Any any specific aptitude for it
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were you know, young kids she was
she was doing her thing at a nursery,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know teaching me about houseplants and
and and and how to how to work in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and you know She's got family
lineage who work in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let her take that that one And go
with it and then we can get to me after
[SPEAKER_04]: for sure Yeah gardening is definitely in
my blood.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first job was at a nursery and I spent
Many years there and I learned all a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of tropical plants and perennials and
annuals Now he took the leap first into
[SPEAKER_04]: hit the cannabis journey and I kind of
stood back for quite some time and just
[SPEAKER_04]: observed and Watched what he was doing and
then I started mixing nutrients and then I
[SPEAKER_04]: guess I got more and more involved and
then I wanted to take off and grow my own
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and it's been quite the journey,
but I'm so glad that He started first then
[SPEAKER_04]: convinced me to start growing as well He's
got a huge motivation and each way through
[SPEAKER_04]: all of this with my endless I've been you
think you guys have been growing then I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been throwing bag seed into the ground
since I was a teenager when my stepdad
[SPEAKER_01]: would you know, he like we'd go gorilla
seed the the the forest in our backyard or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever and it was you know, it's always
fun to come back in in August and see
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know this the six foot tall
plant that you obviously I wasn't paying
[SPEAKER_01]: very much attention to but it's it sets
that sort of internal seed for you of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know Falling in love with the
process right understanding the timelines
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that but About eight years ago You
know, we had just like everybody else had
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten sick and tired of running back and
forth to the plug to the dispensary Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try your hand at growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hard could it be right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll put two plants in the ground
and hey the the immediacy with which I was
[SPEAKER_01]: humbled from my original idea with what it
was gonna be to how it turned out was was
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a driver than anything else for
you, right and and I as you could probably
[SPEAKER_01]: tell I'm a little bit obsessive when I
when I when I latch on to something and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to understand why it wasn't exactly
what I thought it was gonna be became
[SPEAKER_01]: became the the inherent driver for me and
from that moment on it's never really been
[SPEAKER_01]: about The plants for me, I guess it's
always been about the process getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and I love cannabis I love
flower but more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I love the intricacies of the
process the biology the physiology Physics
[SPEAKER_01]: involved the chemistry involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all so fractal and and and you can
keep going further and further and further
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's always a new thing to uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why So I guess Where this all
started was the inability to access any of
[SPEAKER_01]: that information, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd go on seven or eight years ago to to
read it or roll it up for 20 and You ask
[SPEAKER_01]: any question you put up you'd get 35
different answers none of which were based
[SPEAKER_01]: in in any sort of empirical evidence all
of just all of which were just anecdotal
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions from people who had Experienced
something that looked potentially similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that for me was an immediate red flag
like okay Well, like you can go anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: in agriculture and and find very
specifically what any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: functionalities of the planter are from a
from a you know a microscopic level and we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't do that here and I know that in
Canada specifically especially during the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 2000s There was tons of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know where to find it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started chasing it and basically Found
the need to reverse engineer a botany
[SPEAKER_01]: degree from the topics, you know,
I'd started a very high level topic and
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd read through a peer-reviewed paper
and I'd come up to a you know a segment of
[SPEAKER_01]: that paper that I didn't understand what I
was reading so I'd have to go back and now
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading a peer-reviewed paper on what
this this subject is and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand something here and we just kept
going back and back and back till you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I found myself back in grade 11
chemistry again Understanding what
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis actually was and how it
drove various systems within the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: that for me is just what What I find most
enthralling about about growing in general
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am I can agree with that wholeheartedly
it seems like there was not a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: accessible information early on and when
like Because there was information out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but the application to cannabis
seemed so esoteric it was made To almost
[SPEAKER_02]: seem like there was this magic happening
when it's just another plant and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: does the same things other plants do but
it assimilates nutrients in its own way
[SPEAKER_02]: and so like One of the books that like was
available earlier was something like plant
[SPEAKER_02]: empowerment but no one told you to go and
look at plant empowerment and then start
[SPEAKER_02]: applying that to your cannabis and boom
all your greenhouse yields start
[SPEAKER_02]: skyrocketing and all your indoor
environmental parameters are that much
[SPEAKER_02]: tighter and it I think seem like it I
think was hard quite honestly Like asking
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone back then like nobody wanted to
help no, I don't want to tell you anything
[SPEAKER_04]: So is everyone so set in their ways to so
even now that's that's said that's such a
[SPEAKER_01]: great point is that even now it's such an
ego driven industry that that it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: like taboo to Admit that you don't
understand a specific aspect of of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing and just sort of power
through it so that nobody else knows that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know what you're doing and that
it builds this this entire generational
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of foundation of anecdotal experience
based on nothing but guesswork because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's too afraid to sort of ask the
question and it's such a great point is
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only even back then but even now like
a lot of people are Oh, yeah, I knew that
[SPEAKER_01]: and just sort of brush past it without
ever trying to actually understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know for us we find that that
Being wrong is not is not a That's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: knock on your skill set.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a it's not a it's not a weakness
to towards your personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's It's what science is right being
being wrong means we now get to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: right answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whatever that answer is
we'll just chase the data down and it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't impact me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just I'll just You know adjust based
on what the data tells us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely It was it's unfortunate
how much of it is like a fake it till you
[SPEAKER_02]: make it mentality and too many people are
ego driven in this industry because I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's There's this thing with
branding where you have to have this
[SPEAKER_02]: personality and because so much of what's
going on right now in the industry is you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to have branding to make sure that
people remember your face when Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: takes you down one day and you have to pop
up with a new account the next day and
[SPEAKER_02]: have the same people be able to come and
find you it you know, it's things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that that limit our ability to just
maintain some sort of honest reputation in
[SPEAKER_02]: certain aspects and that's that's really
frustrating and I It is hard then to even
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to try to share Like applicable
knowledge when people have encampments
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're sitting and saying oh,
well, this is better than that Or how do
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I grow organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what you're talking about
You grow in with salts and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure I have no idea what I'm talking
about And then try try and come at that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try and come at that perspective
as as as a woman as I imagine flower fox
[SPEAKER_01]: has to deal with you know, trying trying
to have to validate yourself simply
[SPEAKER_01]: because You know, we're in such a such a
male-dominated industry where ego is such
[SPEAKER_01]: a big driver of the fact and oh here comes
this little girl What could she possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: know about when you know, in fact,
she's she's a phenomenal cultivator who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows more about the intrinsic sees about
about You know every facet of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of the people I've I've had the
pleasure of encountering so there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: there's such weird unnecessary entries to
barrier for so many different groups of
[SPEAKER_01]: people in this industry that I think are
so easily knocked down when we when we
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate the veils of of You know the
aesthetic we all try to hold up here For
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's take it back a little bit then
to when you both Started cultivating
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like shark you were kind of
taking that dive first But what were some
[SPEAKER_02]: of those first harvests like and when did
you guys find some really good success
[SPEAKER_02]: with with what you were?
[SPEAKER_02]: experimenting with Nicole what was your
first time with like Well, my first
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest I tried to like fully let him let
me take the lead and I I was a little
[SPEAKER_04]: stubborn and I guess I should have
listened more and I was hanging my plants
[SPEAKER_04]: off the rafters of Things I let everything
stretch and I didn't listen but I must say
[SPEAKER_04]: that like With every grow I learned so
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a lot of mistakes and each grow was
unbelievably better than the last and It's
[SPEAKER_04]: only gone up since then So I'm all about
the construction criticism now From the
[SPEAKER_01]: very from the very beginning when I
started, you know Making an attempt at
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this seriously and deciding that
this is what I was Going to be that I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to do I had it in my head that this
was going to be data driven one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another You know, no matter how
rudimentary that data started out being
[SPEAKER_01]: was that I was going to be able to
implement some some form of repeatability
[SPEAKER_01]: here and and and and I wanted
predictability in my SOP so that I knew no
[SPEAKER_01]: matter how bad this first one ended up
being right no matter how grand grandiose
[SPEAKER_01]: my my my idea was that it was going to
turn out to be that at the end I'd be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to look back and say well this is exactly
What I did to get here and this is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel worked versus this is what I feel
didn't work now obviously without You know
[SPEAKER_01]: a vast pool of experience and especially
practical experience It's hard to it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to sit there after your first girl
and say okay This is what I did and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is what worked but at least you know when
you go back and you're you're now still
[SPEAKER_01]: reading things on reddit you're asking
your questions on roll it up for 20 and
[SPEAKER_01]: now we're trying different things because
you know people are telling you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the way you Should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we go back and we cross reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't do that the first time and
I you know, I saw I saw an improvement
[SPEAKER_01]: here and and you know We start to we start
to Mitigate the things we're finding
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't working for us and the more the
more I chased that that repeatability The
[SPEAKER_01]: more success I started to find obviously
Once I started to understand How powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: a tool automation could be towards
Achieving that repeatability.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I started seeing actual
success, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: and and I know I catch a lot of flack for
it all the time is that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not everyone can automate and Some people
like to just connect with their plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: I will never take that away from anybody
I'll never I'll never insist that somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: goes spends without the outside of their
means in order to achieve this this You
[SPEAKER_01]: know hundred percent dialed in
environment, especially if it's just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you love to Go down and water your
plants but what I will give you is what
[SPEAKER_01]: the data tells me about automating a space
24 hours a day on a hundred different
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics versus a a human being who can't
possibly manage that many metrics that
[SPEAKER_01]: that that minutely that often There is a
vast vast difference in in the performance
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant simply based on on
kinesiology and physiology and I can I can
[SPEAKER_04]: fully agree to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was pretty stubborn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved hand-watering I felt that if I
gave up hand-watering I was not gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to connect and be in that space But
like honestly, I'm in my space a million
[SPEAKER_04]: times more and the difference is night and
day like I I tried to keep up even with
[SPEAKER_04]: his FOP like I followed it to a tee
hand-watering I was hand-watering seven to
[SPEAKER_04]: eight times a day and flower like I wanted
to keep up to that and but it just it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not Night and day it it makes such a
difference and you get to actually spend
[SPEAKER_04]: time being there keeping your space clean
making sure everything's and the fact of
[SPEAKER_01]: the matter isn't you hear you hear a lot
of one of the bigger arguments against
[SPEAKER_01]: automating a space from a homegrown
perspective is that they get they have
[SPEAKER_01]: this this romanticized view of Their part
in the gardening process and it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual and I don't I don't want to take
away from that but at the same time What I
[SPEAKER_01]: can say is that you know automating your
space doesn't negate you being being a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the process You're still a driver
of that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you're you still have to obviously
understand the nuances of the systems that
[SPEAKER_01]: are that are that are occurring within
that plant and and and curate your program
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to to satiate and and and make
those plants happy like this is this is To
[SPEAKER_01]: use their terms connecting With your
plants on on on a level that that's even
[SPEAKER_01]: more I want to say In sync with with what
your plants are feeling and in tune with
[SPEAKER_01]: with their energy or or whatever it is
we're trying to achieve because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: now we're we're looking at every Every
miniscule aspect and every every every
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny function that's happening within that
plant on on a on such a a scaled-down
[SPEAKER_01]: Perspective that that you know,
I've got such a better picture of what my
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is doing versus going in and hand
watering and seeing it the leaves are
[SPEAKER_01]: droopy and you know, just sort of feeling
the plant which again, I don't I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to guess words Like I think it's just
it's it right like Nicole you you can
[SPEAKER_01]: attest to the fact that you know It felt
like you were you were more in tune with
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants when you were hand watering
until you started automating that process
[SPEAKER_01]: And realizing that like now I can read
better You know, I know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I can catch myself much quicker Like
I just feel they're much happier.
[SPEAKER_04]: My yield is Watch my incredible 90
different like and we have more data on
[SPEAKER_01]: how the plant is feeling at any given
moment Spend just as much time down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't I don't really see a
difference unless you want to right and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the other act because you know if if if If
she needed to go away for a day and a half
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's another thing like we've got
five kids like Sundays are crazy like at
[SPEAKER_04]: least I know my plants are being taken
care of at never at any point am I
[SPEAKER_04]: neglecting them and like I could go about
what needs to be done and when Chaos
[SPEAKER_04]: happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not worried which is Like people are
busy like busy Absolutely like at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time I still want my garden but Some
things are just yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like automation doesn't necessarily
remove Your attention to details.
[SPEAKER_02]: It removes your distraction from the
details.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes You have the ability more on like what
needs to be done Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I feel like a lot of people they look at
automation as this thing where they have
[SPEAKER_02]: to automate everything and in some cases
you can just automate certain aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: your grow like let's say you still need to
hand water you can maybe automate your If
[SPEAKER_02]: you're using an intake and exhaust system
you can Manage it to a point where it's it
[SPEAKER_02]: has some parameters for VPD or or you can
maybe automate your air conditioning or
[SPEAKER_02]: heat or humidity or units just to
eliminate just to simply eliminate Jewish
[SPEAKER_01]: fluctuations of of you having to come in
and check and see that Oh, it's dipped a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit I'll better turn it up which
you know over the course of an hour and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half It's gone down three degrees and you
know, it doesn't seem like a big deal But
[SPEAKER_01]: those fluctuations and we'll get into this
in more detail if you'd like it in a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: Those those fluctuations over the course
of 24 hours are limiting limiting the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time Your plants have in a
12-hour light cycle to to to utilize
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything we're trying to provide it in
that time if it's falling outside of those
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal parameters For an hour here an
hour there in and out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: so the the the more we can mitigate those
fluctuations in any capacity if it's It's
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever our limiting factor is the higher
We can push that ceiling and the more of
[SPEAKER_01]: those ceilings we can move up The higher
the higher we're gonna see an exponential
[SPEAKER_01]: progress happening in our in our
performance in the garden Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like Liebig's law keeps coming up
in my conversations lately where you have
[SPEAKER_02]: like the the different staves and if one
of them is too low then that's as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: you can fill that barrel and Even if you
have other parameters that are set ideally
[SPEAKER_02]: at other set points and conditions There's
something else holding you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we have things if we're pushing
in 1500 PPFD of light because Because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're pushing 3.0 EC and we're scaling it
up to you know a 10 PW EC by by our by our
[SPEAKER_01]: peak by our peak dryback But our VPD isn't
on point right so that that one little
[SPEAKER_01]: that one Little uptick in our in our in
our SOP is now causing that that VPD to be
[SPEAKER_01]: our limiting factor And and we're gonna
see exponential exponential problems start
[SPEAKER_01]: start working their way outwards because
of that that that one little ripple in the
[SPEAKER_01]: system that's that's causing these these
Cataclysmic outward waves almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: like a ripple in a pond, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, sometimes I feel like people
try to perfect the little hmm minutiae
[SPEAKER_02]: within the all of these different settings
within a grow and sometimes you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow for a little bit of wiggle room on
either end if your Control parameters
[SPEAKER_02]: can't be as tight as you would want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that that's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you would you rather have would you
rather have all of your parameters?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% dialed into spec with one of them
Uncontrollable and and falling completely
[SPEAKER_01]: out of spec or would you rather have all
of your parameters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a within an acceptable range and
none of them falling completely out of
[SPEAKER_01]: spec right like this There's a dichotomy
there where you have to decide and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of formulate what what's what you're
capable of in of controlling in your space
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and what Where you want to sort of
give that give back if that makes sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like so at some point none of us can can
have it a hundred percent perfect at all
[SPEAKER_01]: times so For example, right if I can't get
my humidity on point Do I scale back the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I just keep everything as it is and
just try and push through that one
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity issue, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I do I bring the room back to where
that humidity is no longer an issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be giving up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be leaving something on the table
somewhere in order to achieve that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a matter of What what's going to be
the big exactly the bigger risk the least
[SPEAKER_02]: impact when it feels like sometimes those
those different aspects of like let's say
[SPEAKER_02]: you do have something where you can't
control humidity, but you can push
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else, you know at a hundred
percent, let's say then I feel like the
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that it affects in the end is
the quality because we have this You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a it's a it is a special plant in a
certain way because it does have All these
[SPEAKER_02]: different needs that can be met that then
produce this really exceptional end
[SPEAKER_02]: product that can be so unique and
Different based on the the different
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like let's say you are in a
situation where you're running really high
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD throughout the grow just because you
have low humidity You're north in the
[SPEAKER_02]: latitudes and you just get really cold and
dry in winter So yeah, if you can't really
[SPEAKER_02]: get that part up then maybe you bring
everything else down because that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: your best option for quality But if you
need quantity then maybe maybe you're okay
[SPEAKER_02]: with a little bit lower quality,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the analogy the analogy would the
analogy I guess would be is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a race car on the racetrack in
the middle of a race, right and When you
[SPEAKER_01]: floor that gas pedal you've blown one it
you've blown one valve Do you keep pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: as hard as you can to try and get it
across the finish line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you ease off to gas pedal and try to
preserve the engine?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a chance you at least cross in
third Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you go for first and chance you blow
the blow the motor and don't even cross
[SPEAKER_01]: the line at all, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the yeah exactly because sometimes you
see those those parts where one aspect of
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow kind of crashes out and the
entire grow just Does not make it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: finish line or what does make it to the
finish line is pretty much like this is
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles at best Get to get the washers
we're getting we're washing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right Well, so when when do you feel
like you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than automation, where do you feel
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: you found early success with your growing
style and and what kind of led you or like
[SPEAKER_02]: pushed you towards the different aspects
of what you kind of explored to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: either increase quality or or increase
some sort of Helpful parameter of what the
[SPEAKER_02]: end product was because I feel like you
have a few of those tricks that Commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators will keep really close to the
chest but that you seem to talk about open
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of helping people one of one
of the easiest ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, it's obviously not an easy
topic it's relatively complex,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one of the the the first most
immediate ones that comes to mind this is
[SPEAKER_01]: high frequency fertigation and
understanding understanding how PwC VWC
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and water potential No worries,
thank you so much for joining us if you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to hop back in later feel free Yeah,
I'll try to hop back in later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for sure I think One of the
one of the ways I like to educate Is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little different than then I tend to see a
lot of the other, you know cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: educators doing it is that everybody likes
to say you know, here's step a B C D E F G
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way through Z follow these and
this is how it'll do it but That leads us
[SPEAKER_01]: as as consumers of that education to just
try to hit numbers That we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily understand right as long as
they hit those numbers will be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as something goes Goes goes a
little off track We don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehension to understand how to a bring
it back or be why it's continuing to slide
[SPEAKER_01]: left to right and I think Not focusing on
here's how you germinate a seed 8080
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever right let it germinate in the
dark put it out put it in your senior solo
[SPEAKER_01]: cup and Not giving you this the linear
steps of how to grow a plant But focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: on on the systems that are occurring
within the plant itself it's a living
[SPEAKER_01]: being and understanding how all of those
all of those functions are are operating
[SPEAKER_01]: in unison to create this symbiotic process
that's that's Machine like right and if we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand if we understand Osmotic
pressure and we understand water potential
[SPEAKER_01]: and we understand vapor pressure We
understand transpiration if we understand
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration We understand how water
movement occurs within the plant and if we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that along with understanding
Osmotic potential we know how we can how
[SPEAKER_01]: we can drive that up in order to in order
to force a higher a higher uptake of ions
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and all of these all of these
these fancy sounding You know technical
[SPEAKER_01]: terms that we're trying to get to,
you know stacking high PWEC in during bulk
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all just buds buzzwords unless
we understand what the plant itself is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing on an ionic level on a microscopic
level on a cellular level that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing these things to happen and as
soon as As soon as I you know started
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understood how high frequency
fertigation could be much more beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: than what I was trying to accomplish just
you know throwing water in the pot and and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and hoping that it takes it up and as
soon as as soon as we start doing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can start we can start tightening in our
irrigation SOPs and the tighter that
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation SOP becomes through experience
and through understanding It through
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding the system itself water
adhesion water potential matric potential
[SPEAKER_01]: Osmotic balance and gradient understanding
those and it sounds like a lot when I just
[SPEAKER_01]: said it to you right now in a you know in
a in an unbroken sentence, but the fact of
[SPEAKER_01]: the matter is each of those concepts are
something that we've all Basically already
[SPEAKER_01]: understand just not in this context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding that water likes to stick
to itself, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that the drier the the cocoa
gets the harder It's going to be for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to pull up water away from the
fibers of the soil that it's sticking to
[SPEAKER_01]: You know this already but having me
explain it to you in a in the context Of
[SPEAKER_01]: what that's happen what's happening when
you water your plant now you have this
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes sense to me So you're no longer
looking at your drying out pot is is it
[SPEAKER_01]: too dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not too dry now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at it in the context of
matric potential and how far can they dry
[SPEAKER_01]: back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well while the roots build up osmotic
gradient in order to pull those those
[SPEAKER_01]: those increased salts and it it makes it
makes sense to you now as as Somebody who
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have a degree in biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't But when I was able to put
Watering into that context it all made
[SPEAKER_01]: sense and from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to Improve my process simply
because I understood what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was happening from a from a
thermodynamic perspective or a fluid
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanics perspective, right no longer
Whatever the the nutrient manual is
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me perspective it's it's two
different ways of looking at What you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to accomplish one just allows you
to to understand the complexities of what
[SPEAKER_02]: what it is you're doing right,
absolutely, I mean I've I've heard it
[SPEAKER_02]: described as simply as plants just being
water pumps and they're just taking water
[SPEAKER_02]: from the ground and pushing it out into
the air and Then yeah by applying the
[SPEAKER_02]: different ideas of you know, there's that
old chemistry Experiment for like first
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's like really young kids
and you take salty water and you pour it
[SPEAKER_02]: into a beaker and then you pour Fresh
water on top of it and you can color one
[SPEAKER_02]: of them and you can see how they sit in
the difference And then you can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do they do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly what I was alluding to
is that we know all of these concepts were
[SPEAKER_01]: were were taught them in a in a in a In a
very functional way at a very early age
[SPEAKER_01]: how all of These things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of of applying those
those concepts of physics to To what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing it one of the first tips I
give anybody is if you've got access to a
[SPEAKER_01]: grade 11 biology book or crack that
son-of-a-bitch open because it'll tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot about it'll tell you about a lot
about you know, cellulamytosis and and how
[SPEAKER_01]: osmosis works and and almost
three-quarters of what you're gonna open
[SPEAKER_01]: in those pages you can you can then turn
around and go back and say oh that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually happening right here in my garden
when you know when when I see I'm adding
[SPEAKER_01]: too much calcium or you read for example
in those books how how chemical bonds
[SPEAKER_01]: happen and understand that You know with
it with an increased amount of of calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: ions in in in a solution if you add
phosphorus to that solution They're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: stick together and create gypsum and fall
to the floor making them not plant
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Instead of somebody telling you like oh
you need more cal mag in your solution
[SPEAKER_01]: Helping them understand how calcium
actually works within a chemical solution
[SPEAKER_01]: gives them the understanding Of why their
plants might not be calcium or might be
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium deficient and adding more calcium
to the reservoir isn't helping your
[SPEAKER_01]: problem It's only exacerbating it right
and these are these are the ways that I
[SPEAKER_01]: found I found my my my successes in the
garden and I I would voraciously read
[SPEAKER_01]: every peer-reviewed paper I could the the
deeper I got into Into into each function
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, you know, there there was a
point where I became almost obsessively
[SPEAKER_01]: exploratory about about cation anion
balance and how nutrient propositions were
[SPEAKER_01]: were were formulated and Understanding how
those things interact together and why why
[SPEAKER_01]: would we put chlorine in our water?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy talk but turns out all of
these things have have Chemical basis and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical foundation that that spanned back
hundred years of agriculture We're just
[SPEAKER_01]: applying them to to what we're trying to
do You know, I'm a play some of the some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the we have to give credit I guess to
to the people who figured a lot of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out anecdotally without access to
the information and that is a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the debate the the the grow
house guys and that the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: guys who were doing Gorilla style I give
them a lot of flack because a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: community refuses to advance forward
Despite the fact that science has come
[SPEAKER_01]: such a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot of the resting on our
laurels Deal but the fact of the matter is
[SPEAKER_01]: is they figured it out without without
having any of this these tools available
[SPEAKER_01]: to them Whether they understood what they
had figured out or not And I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where a lot of the bro science comes from
a lot of these myths come from is that
[SPEAKER_01]: well these guys did something That worked
in 1999 compared to what we were doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1999 and they attributed their success to
X Y and Z Flashing it with ice or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the case is and the fact of the matter is
those weren't inherently what were
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for their successes But the
way the environment, you know mitigated
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those crazy things that were they
were doing because it was such a perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: environment You know, so whether whether
You know, we're we're introducing things
[SPEAKER_01]: that That have been done for forever or
not You know, we've been figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: these things for a long time But now we've
got the evidence to either say well,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, this one was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one isn't true.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like Well, so let's let's talk a
little bit about experimental design then
[SPEAKER_02]: because it sounds like you're one of the
issues that you have with these older
[SPEAKER_02]: school thoughts of growing is that they
would Throw something at the plant and if
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant did well that year they'd say
well that's what caused it and then if
[SPEAKER_02]: they did it next year and Something else
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd say oh well something else
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm but I'm still applying this next year
because it did it really good that one
[SPEAKER_02]: year, so You know, but with experimental
design a lot of that needs to be that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making sure that it's not some
external factor that's causing the change
[SPEAKER_02]: and then being misattributed to whatever
that experimental design is so what are
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things that you've done in
your garden where you put together a plan
[SPEAKER_02]: of being like this is the thing that I'm
changing and so did you see that it like
[SPEAKER_01]: succeeded and what you were hoping for the
two the two biggest ones that I Three,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will call it three One of the things I
guess I'm most famous for is is my my
[SPEAKER_01]: drying protocol that it was Pretty
controversial when I when I first started
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about it But as people started
digging into the science the more people
[SPEAKER_01]: felt comfortable Trying to implement it
the more feedback I started getting that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is this is game-changing I've never
seen anything like it and so that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: directly towards what we were talking
about initially is that the 6060 drying
[SPEAKER_01]: principle comes from the from that era
where you know, this is the best we could
[SPEAKER_01]: basically achieve right we could hang it
where we could hang it in hiding and and
[SPEAKER_01]: This got us close and the problem is Is
that like I said, we were we were
[SPEAKER_01]: attributing sort of accidental success or
not even success You know coming close to
[SPEAKER_01]: success with success because it was better
than the failures we were seeing outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of that realm The problem is is it doesn't
6060 doesn't follow the logic that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to employ implementing a 6060
drying technique and what I mean by that
[SPEAKER_01]: is By leaving a plant on the Rack for an X
amount of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't follow a linear drying path,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to bring in the principles of
thermodynamics and water adhesion and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that that At a certain point the
vapor pressure is going to overcome the
[SPEAKER_01]: water adhesion Factor and break that
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're pulling you know where at
first we were pulling water from the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of the flower through through Water
adhesion this water droplet was pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: the one in the middle closer to the set to
the surface at some point the vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure Is is going to overcome that
water adhesion and that chain is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: break and now we're left with Water slowly
in the middle of the flower not being
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled out by that surface water anymore
that surface water exits the flower it
[SPEAKER_01]: feels crumbly and dry outside even after
two days or whatever right and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it again with the water in the
middle starts to slowly diffuse back
[SPEAKER_01]: outwards and and eventually over 14 days
we get to Near or hopefully near an
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable water activity the problem with
with with leaving it On the rack for 14
[SPEAKER_01]: days is once that once that chain in the
middle breaks and we're left with that
[SPEAKER_01]: water sitting That's like a 30 or 40
percent moisture content inside an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: material over the course of the next 10
days What is that the best environment for
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've ever heard right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Love loves to grow in moist dank
environments that sit for 10 days What I
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at was how how do we achieve a
linear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry so the same rate of evaporative drying
over Over a linear amount of time and and
[SPEAKER_01]: what that means is that we have to we have
to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Drying in two phases right one's got to be
our normal dry and then once that chain
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks We have to kick up the vapor
pressure in order to pull that water out
[SPEAKER_01]: faster to maintain That even drying rate
because the first phase is going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out really quick If we don't pull out that
second phase at the same rate we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be left with that Sitting water so I
looked at every imaginable metric all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the compiled data and we looked at what
temperature degradation to terpenes did at
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain value over a certain amount of
time and what was found was that
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature to a certain point has
negligible effect on terpene degradation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they looked at something like 32
different terpenes Between 4 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Celsius and 42 degrees Celsius the loss of
terpenes for every 10 degrees was
[SPEAKER_01]: something like like 2% or whatever and we
can go back and look at my study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it all referenced there
negligible basically versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation loss we saw at 60 degrees
temperature over the course of two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is nearly a 30% loss in terpenes
Just sitting on the rack so that tells us
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what we do the longer we leave a
plant hanging on the rack to dry The lower
[SPEAKER_01]: those secondary metabolite numbers are
going to be the quicker we can get it off
[SPEAKER_01]: the rack the faster We can get it down to
our safe AW and into our preservative
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions the higher those numbers are
going to be So that was that was that one
[SPEAKER_01]: took a significant amount of trial and
experimentation and and and Going against
[SPEAKER_01]: the grain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got called crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy your hey blah blah blah,
but we can go back now and we can review
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody Like people are doing this in
hundred lighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got I've got I've got I've never seen
a single person come back with negative
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback on that protocol specifically I
take I take pride in the fact that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I I dug up as much of that the
evidence of it as I could I tried to put
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a digestible readable format that
was accessible to everybody but at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the day, that's not I didn't invent it
It's just what physics says is the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be done, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not some magical discovery
by me The the the principles of diffusion
[SPEAKER_01]: are are there like they're just sitting
right there waiting to be applied to your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant Because we've been doing it a way
that kind of worked 40 years ago That's
[SPEAKER_02]: like a 6060 is kind of where you want it
to be at right as you're bucking it off
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant but you don't want to sit there
to get there and So we also have in
[SPEAKER_02]: certain commercial settings one of the
things that I've ran into Is that your
[SPEAKER_02]: drying room is the same as your storage
room and so temperature there then is
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely important So what what we found
is we just drop it down to a really low
[SPEAKER_02]: relative humidity at 60 or 55 degrees and
leave until you get your AW acceptable
[SPEAKER_02]: water activity absolutely and then from
there we just slowly raise it back up and
[SPEAKER_02]: Works great usually and that's still 12
days, but it is hard in certain aspects,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think the way the way you're doing
it is is is significantly more beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: than then Well, we can't hit those targets
So we'll just leave it on as long as we
[SPEAKER_01]: can get it out because low and slow or
whatever the case is No being able to that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes into the other huge misconception
about what is curing and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: have this this Very very romanticized idea
about what curing is and without having an
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding and and I don't think the
industry yet Clearly has a good
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of what they're trying to
accomplish when curing and it's not it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not this it's not this You know fabled
Magic elixir that we're we're we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know product a to product 12
It's we're not changing the contribution
[SPEAKER_01]: of of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing and I think Understanding
that curing has many different forms
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what we're trying to apply to
is it wine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it wood?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it cheese is a concrete is right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it is it resin?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these things mean different things
and I think when we're looking when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at curing dried flower What that
means to me is we got our flower down to a
[SPEAKER_01]: safe water activity but we still have that
problem where The water is not evenly
[SPEAKER_01]: diffused throughout that entire flower,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pockets of moisture here and here
and summer dryer here and here so when we
[SPEAKER_01]: get that flower into a jar or into a cure
container or a cure space that's at So
[SPEAKER_01]: atmospheric equilibrium or vapor pressure
equilibrium equals water activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can get our equilibrium to 64%
Humidity in our cure jar close it down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where where that vapor pressure
only pulls The water to equilibrium to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where you know, there's no there's
no longer force acting on the flower The
[SPEAKER_01]: water is going to distribute to the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is going to be exactly evenly
distributed And our flowers going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: one homogeneous moisture content and
that's all we're trying to achieve if we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to burp it and let moisture out
because it keeps climbing higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: there then then then our relative equal
relative equal humidity That means we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't hit our safe water activity target.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're still drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in it Curing should simply be
the final extension of drying where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to reconstitute the homogeneity
Homogeneity of the of the moisture content
[SPEAKER_01]: of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not We're not doing this it's
breaking down this and it's breaking down
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's gonna happen over the course
of weeks along with your secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites along with the fats the lipids
the chlorophyll molecules Which will oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the more of those unwanted
pigments and stuff that that that we allow
[SPEAKER_01]: in a preservative condition to sort of
degrade naturally on their own We're also
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna lose terpenes were in cannabinoids
and and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're losing all of those things as well,
but because It's not as adulterated with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the compounds that we're still in
there the chlorophylls the fats the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohols the ethanol We're gonna perceive
the flavor palette of what we do have left
[SPEAKER_01]: as much more Refined and much more
palatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I think the notion that
you know along for we cure makes it taste
[SPEAKER_01]: better The count is is inarguably less
than it was four weeks ago when it made it
[SPEAKER_01]: might have tasted grassier But it's also a
little bit more refined because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminated some of those other things as
well, right, you know, it makes me think
[SPEAKER_02]: as though there's kind of and and There's
just hearing you talk about it made me
[SPEAKER_02]: think about this But it's almost like
there's two different thresholds that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're kind of aiming for and one of them
is the the mold operational threshold
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're getting a water activity
below this Operational threshold so that
[SPEAKER_02]: the mold will not sporulate it or it
shouldn't Unless you have some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: random humidity spike event or something
like that and then you get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: enzymatic operational active water
activity zone So all your enzymes can
[SPEAKER_02]: continue what they're doing there and then
below that that's where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: will over dry and They'll still have that
hay smell and they'll like but I dried it
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way and it's like well you you you
need to allow for the enzymes to operate
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to allow for the breakdown and
the Homogenizing of moisture and for all
[SPEAKER_02]: of these other things to occur that are
still occurring in this and that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the cure right, so and and what's so
important about that what's so important
[SPEAKER_01]: about that is that you know having having
a water activity Below a certain threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: we still need that moisture which still
leaves the potential for for You know that
[SPEAKER_01]: water is not bound that water is available
for any any cellular organism to to to to
[SPEAKER_01]: use for their needs including including
mold spores The goal here is that if we
[SPEAKER_01]: get it below That that acceptable
threshold it's not nearly enough bound
[SPEAKER_01]: water to compete with the enzymes that are
still actively working to do those those
[SPEAKER_01]: those Biological functions right and this
is this is going to keep the CFU far below
[SPEAKER_01]: even a registerable amount, you know,
hopefully zero which it never is but You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it's it's it's all a matter of water
competition and the enzymes are always
[SPEAKER_01]: going to out compete a foreign organism
for for that that unbound water within the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower so as long as We're in within a
safe range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said we're we're now out of the
danger zone where colony forming units
[SPEAKER_01]: start to start to propagate and we're but
we're still within within that that cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the cells are hydrated enough to
the point where where there is that
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymatic activity and there is there is a
cellular breakdown of various pigmentation
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and and the remaining chloroplasts
that are left in there which like I said
[SPEAKER_01]: while degrading You know the secondary
metabolite count it's also reducing that
[SPEAKER_01]: that unwanted adulterant in your plant so
You know, it's it's a matter of you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have your quote-unquote thirty
four percent THC right off the plant But
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time it is gonna taste better
once it's down to you know, twenty two
[SPEAKER_01]: percent But still has four percent
terpenes and none of the other or much
[SPEAKER_01]: fewer of the other compounds that we that
we end up tasting Absolutely It's very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to like curing meats or pickles
where you're aiming for a specific water
[SPEAKER_02]: activity within these brines or Salt packs
or other things like that where then
[SPEAKER_02]: you're allowing for specific bacteria,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's microbes to operate specifically
Yeah, absolutely with cheeses as well and
[SPEAKER_02]: then other things to not operate within
that because the the salinity is too high
[SPEAKER_02]: and when we say salinity is too high it's
because that affects the water activity
[SPEAKER_02]: within that product so it's it's curing is
curing all of all the way around well and
[SPEAKER_01]: you brought up such a good point that I
think we both skipped over a little bit is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know, they people people will
complain about this hay smell and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: attribute it to either being a salt grow
or I can say with confidence that ninety
[SPEAKER_01]: nine point nine percent of the time this
happened in your dry or cure phase and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's either that you undershot your your
your aw target during the dry you Came in
[SPEAKER_01]: with your lights on so one of the funny
things that happens that people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: realize is they'll chop down their plants
they'll hang it up and then they'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: in with their with their with their grow
lights blasting and take their videos and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff for two days of the upside down
plants hanging that plant basically has no
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that you chopped it down especially
in the first two days when when the water
[SPEAKER_01]: content in that plant is 80% and all the
cellular functions are still happening
[SPEAKER_01]: like plants are on right and as soon as
you flip those lights on the chloroplasts
[SPEAKER_01]: flip over and they're like, oh time to
photosynthesize again So we've been here
[SPEAKER_01]: for you know chlorophyll will break down
It's been shown in rice over the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: three days of darkness It'll break down to
on next to nothing and the plant will be
[SPEAKER_01]: it will have no no ability to
photosynthesize past that three days of
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness But the instant you turn the
light on above for you mole It's like
[SPEAKER_01]: hello waking up and as long as there's
moisture content within those cells to to
[SPEAKER_01]: complete that that Calvin cycle It's gonna
start taking in those photons and
[SPEAKER_01]: producing more chlorophyll to do that
again and again so by the end of weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: week two or whatever of your of your 60 60
dry and you take it off and it smells like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking grass and that's because You
we got to our dry period but you kept
[SPEAKER_01]: turning the lights on it kept producing
chlorophyll that we were trying to to To
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate in the first place and by the
time that water activity was so low It
[SPEAKER_01]: could no longer it could no longer break
that down into CFC blues and now that's
[SPEAKER_01]: all you taste is a green That's that's a
really good point and I don't think a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's That's a really wonderful point
That's it's those little things like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it's the drying part is everybody
thinks they got to the end now and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just hang it up and then I'll get to smoke
it but if this is this is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: critical part in my in my opinion is
getting Getting it down to our acceptable
[SPEAKER_01]: AW as quickly as we can and then getting
it to the right preservative conditions as
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly as we can It's not a matter of of
I didn't flush for two weeks which It's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's simply a matter of of understanding
what the plant is going through in those
[SPEAKER_01]: last couple of days while it's trying to
You know while it's it's basically trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to survive and it's sending out it's
sending out all sorts of crazy signals to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and do things and For the the deeper
we understand that on a cellular level
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I had to read papers on on
how chloroplasts behave in the dark in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to understand that but once I did
Now I understood that you know during
[SPEAKER_01]: those first three days my plants are
actually still alive and and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're they're behaving accordingly Right
including with transpiration other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that we're eliminating The
vascular aspect of being able to take up
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still sweating it out They're
still trying to photosynthesize and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still very much utilizing the the
Molecules they've got within their within
[SPEAKER_01]: their structure to to complete those
functions I definitely smoke somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: first grow who knew how to cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well You know, even if it was the area's
larpiest, you know weirdest end product
[SPEAKER_02]: but then they dried it and cured it well
and it didn't have terrible hay smell
[SPEAKER_02]: smell or anything like that to it and if
it was you know crumbly like kinetic sand
[SPEAKER_02]: and not overly dried and I would still for
sure give it a try but Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had plenty of people be like,
oh, this is you know, my 10th 12th,
[SPEAKER_02]: however many you know Tens of grows they
just keep missing that one part and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the it's the try and the cure Always that
it seems like you can just really ruin eat
[SPEAKER_02]: the best of products so Yeah, that's a
that's a very you know, that's I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's huge and I could see how that could
make sort of the It can demystify a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: this Stigma about like bad bud or you know
Yeah, and it is well or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I say I found it's also it's also Open
people's perspectives who were like dead
[SPEAKER_01]: set against salt growing because that was
their experience Is that every time they
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked something from their buddy who
grows with salt it tastes disgusting but
[SPEAKER_01]: they get organic from the dispensary and
it tastes and and and They seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: conflate those two Things as being an
issue and that sets them off growing In an
[SPEAKER_01]: assault based system simply because they
think that's what their end results gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be I hear the same thing with Athena all
the time like oh no Athena's Athena's
[SPEAKER_01]: cardboard or whatever and and the fact of
the matter is is that's that can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: true, but it's not because of the reason
people think it is and This leads into my
[SPEAKER_01]: other one you ever heard the the the the
bro science myth Cut out nitrogen and late
[SPEAKER_01]: flower just cut it out so there's actually
Huge validity so that the problem is is
[SPEAKER_01]: the way these nutrient companies formulate
their nutrients one There's been There's
[SPEAKER_01]: endless data to show that that high
amounts of NH4 in any capacity Will
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely fuck up your plant's secondary
metabolite count no ifs ands or buts about
[SPEAKER_01]: it all all of the better nutrient
companies will have a blend of of NH4 plus
[SPEAKER_01]: and and and non-nitrate nitrogen Because
the plant likes a combination of both
[SPEAKER_01]: specific nitrogen molecules in order to
optimize the uptake the thing is over a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain value We see the secondary
metabolite and cannabinoid production drop
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfathomably so you go from something like
60 micro milliliters per liter or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: and You see a sharp drop of 30% reduction
in secondary metabolites all the way up to
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up to a 60% reduction in
secondary metabolites Whereas if we start
[SPEAKER_01]: to show a nitrogen deficiency this causes
a stress response in the plant to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolites, so simply by
finding a way to manipulate your specific
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient regimen to reduce the amount of
of Nitrogen post bulking once your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: have finished setting their flowers put on
as much mass as they can we want to shut
[SPEAKER_01]: that that nitrogen number down to as much
as we can if Zero because we've still got
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of it built up inside the root zone
the problem is is that We can't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily just like cut out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call it advanced nutrients a or
whatever because that's got that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: your cal nitrate So now you're cutting out
calcium magnesium nitrogen zinc boron all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the micros that that we're gonna do so
I found I found that by playing with
[SPEAKER_01]: specific nutrient ratios and mixes
particularly by slowly tapering down on on
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom and introducing fade at the same
Time with Athena, which isn't part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: program I'd been able to see a huge
increase in secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_01]: production to the point where Athena's
chemists had reached out and asked me to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of help drive their SOP changes in
that regard so like it's it's it's little
[SPEAKER_01]: there there are little things that we can
do that will Absolutely change the way our
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens perform from the last run with
just a little alteration right as As as to
[SPEAKER_01]: how we apply those nutrient ratios or how
we how we we dry our plants in ten days
[SPEAKER_01]: less than we than we ordinarily would or
How we implement the Emerson effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: During flower those those type of things
those three things in particular have been
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest improvements to my garden and
as you know the more experience you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the less The less wide those increases
Feel right they they become they become
[SPEAKER_01]: much more Much more incremental increases
in your in your improvement because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's only so much more to understand
right every every win is now just a a
[SPEAKER_01]: micro win on top of something we already
knew right so when you start every every
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements this big massive leap whereas
now we're making these small incremental
[SPEAKER_01]: improvements to our to our to our
processes, but those three that we just
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed moved me from a guy who grows
flower to To shark most farms as as
[SPEAKER_01]: arrogant as that may come across,
you know, I don't I never intended to be
[SPEAKER_01]: that way, but I think My processes are
revered for a specific reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because I was willing to do That
experimentation and and I wasn't bound by
[SPEAKER_01]: by You know fiduciary responsibility to my
shareholders or or or an obligation to
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfill a specific quota of flower or
whatever the case is I had enough room to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to to experiment and implement
different different scientific ideas and
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and see what was most beneficial
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's uh, let's kind of do a little
thought experiment then and Run,
[SPEAKER_02]: so since you haven't really been growing
for flower for a few months now Run us
[SPEAKER_02]: through your final iteration That you did
run, you know, what what was your Like
[SPEAKER_02]: what were some of the different ear?
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters and set points that you shot
for Just so that people can kind of get a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of what you were doing in right
iteration so we went We went for a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: a turn and burn I would have I would have
my clones rooted and into the blocks
[SPEAKER_01]: Within seven days and once they went into
the blocks I'd water those one gallon one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon blocks, you know I'll calculate the
best way to figure out how big your media
[SPEAKER_01]: should be in your space is to figure out
what your overall canopy size is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: end up being in that space and and from
there we can calculate the expected water
[SPEAKER_01]: loss volume through Through transpiration
which will give you an idea of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: water you need to go through giving you an
idea of how big your media should be in
[SPEAKER_01]: any case I ended up running 26 one gallon
pots in that room and I was putting on For
[SPEAKER_01]: the most part during most of the run no
more than eight shots a day of irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal was to slowly stack up the EC
from the moment those plants were rooted I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to bring up the EC all the way up
to its max point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to have my PPFD ready to go at
1200 PPFD from the moment I flipped in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower stacked all the way up to 10 EC and
then Drive that transition as hard as I
[SPEAKER_01]: could for the first two and a half weeks
One of the things so a couple of things I
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented it as a To make that run as
much of a success as it was was to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to one Go into bulking at about week at
about Day 17 instead of waiting till you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I got to day 24 25 which gave me a
leg up And and by doing that, you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to do that because I was able to
start day one of flower at 1200 PPFD
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing that high EC You know already
coming into a 25% overnight dry back So
[SPEAKER_01]: those first three weeks are critical and
you can't go back and fix them It's all
[SPEAKER_01]: about setting the flowers in place and
getting that that plant's Physiology into
[SPEAKER_01]: a hormonal shift where it's going anyways
But we got to push it into that flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: shift as quickly as possible and by
applying as much as much As much targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: stress onto the plant as we can during
those first three weeks We're able to flip
[SPEAKER_01]: it over as quickly as we can set those
flowers and then ease off the pressure as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as we can come bulking to allow it to
just take up whatever it needs its The
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers are already set.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already established as to as to
what that that entire coal is going to end
[SPEAKER_01]: up looking like We're already the plant
isn't going back into a vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: hormonal state So now that we're already
in a flowering hormonal state We can ease
[SPEAKER_01]: off all that pressure and give it
everything it wants from from you know
[SPEAKER_01]: week two and a half all the way to week
six and just Fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there I dropped the nitrogen
right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I starved it for Nitrogen while still
giving it really and and now I move back
[SPEAKER_01]: into a Targeted stress phase where I'm
giving it a really heavy dry back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start to increase the VPD and really
make that plant sweat In order to think
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Danger ahead, you know the end of
my life is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd better do everything I can To build
resinous flowers throw it as many sigmas
[SPEAKER_01]: as I can to try and collect some pollen
Which I'm not gonna let it do obviously so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just gonna keep stacking those those
calyxes on top of one another and the end
[SPEAKER_01]: result by Implementing those three
specific strategies that together was was
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimal we'll call it a minimal yield
dilution and what I mean by that is
[SPEAKER_01]: generally it's either it's either You know
all the plant spends as much of its
[SPEAKER_01]: resources building building biomass Which
takes away from its ability to to create
[SPEAKER_01]: those secondary metabolites that we're
after those volatile oils that we're after
[SPEAKER_01]: those trichomes that we're after or You
know, we we we stress it so hard that it
[SPEAKER_01]: spends all of its energy producing those
protectants like that are the main
[SPEAKER_01]: function of the trichomes and it doesn't
have the energy necessary to to Divide
[SPEAKER_01]: that into additional biomass implementing
some of these cues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said being able to transition it
from transition to bulking quicker due to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Emerson effect and pushing off And
letting off of the targeted stress at
[SPEAKER_01]: specific implemented times allows you to
sort of Walk that line where you can build
[SPEAKER_01]: up the the biomass of the plant before
allowing it to pack on All of those
[SPEAKER_01]: secondaries that we're after so the
biggest takeaway for me is that we're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: fluid system here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's it's never You know week
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're doing week two.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're doing week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're doing we're we're
following what the plant is Is is
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally doing and we're we're we're
we're optimizing and tailoring it to that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's physiology for the best outcome
What were some of your EC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Targets as well as like temperatures and
humidities throughout this run so a big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is people like to and we discussed
this with with the drying thing is that
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes evaporate at 77 degrees or
whatever the case is and this is This is
[SPEAKER_01]: true to an extent off gassing happens,
but this is this is occurring in in
[SPEAKER_01]: environments from ambient You know 68
degree temperature all the way up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred degree temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the key here is to ensure that
your your VPD is Acting in as an agent for
[SPEAKER_01]: your water potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when when we talk about Understanding
VPD it's doing so in the context of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing how that's impacting how the plant
is pulling water So I if I'm if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: driving A really high EC that's going to
be pulling a lot of water I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what that's going to be doing
to the osmotic pressure and the PW EC in
[SPEAKER_01]: my root zone and I'm gonna have to adjust
all of those those Metrics in unison so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they all fit one another accordingly
During transition like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was Pushing really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see a minimum of 6 EC at the
root zone to a peak of 10 EC just as I
[SPEAKER_01]: started introducing those first P ones
over the course of the day and as I'd get
[SPEAKER_01]: as I'd get to that peak EC, especially
during transition I would be pushing very
[SPEAKER_01]: minimal if any runoff just to maintain
that 10 EC the whole ride through Now when
[SPEAKER_01]: we get talk about getting to bulking,
I'm slow I'm not I'm not what I'm not now
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to push 20% runoff on every
irrigation to try and bring that down what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing is I'm slowly reducing that
osmotic pressure day over day just so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: lower than it was the day before that way
it's it's now it's it's like working out
[SPEAKER_01]: with with a barbell right and then putting
that barbell down and picking up a pencil
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden the pencil feels like
nothing right if I'm if Day one my PWC is
[SPEAKER_01]: at 10 and then the next day with a little
bit of runoff I bring it down to 9.5 that
[SPEAKER_01]: pencil is gonna feel a little bit lighter
I'm gonna be able to pull up more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients I'm gonna be able to bulk higher
so the goal is to ride that peak EC
[SPEAKER_01]: through transition and then when I get
into bulking day over day bringing it back
[SPEAKER_01]: down to that 6 number but not all the way
down because once bulking is done and we
[SPEAKER_01]: go into ripening I got to scale it all the
way back up again so we're riding we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this 3.0 EC input yep okay and you
do you run that all the way from veg
[SPEAKER_01]: through flour as well as fade so I'll get
I'll get my I'll get my EC up from clone
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'll start my clones out at 2 EC and
I'll allow them to start to work the PWC
[SPEAKER_01]: up as they root into the blocks and as
they do I'm slowly increasing my input EC
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm only getting 10% dry backs in
that first couple those first two weeks of
[SPEAKER_01]: veg right so I can safely increase the
input EC while not worrying about
[SPEAKER_01]: overdoing the PWC and as soon as we flip
and I start to see those 15 20 25 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: dry backs I don't have to worry about
climbing up the EC because I'm already
[SPEAKER_01]: there my and now I'm just worrying about
the PWC as managed through my dry backs
[SPEAKER_02]: got it yeah no I mean that's I like to ask
because some people will try to manipulate
[SPEAKER_02]: it through raising or lowering their input
but I like to say you know it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really more about raising or lowering your
volume just to make sure that you hit
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff yeah I got might up here too I've
been seeing them floating around but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like all the things that you can keep
consistent without having to chase
[SPEAKER_01]: something is really important so one of
the one of the cool little papers I
[SPEAKER_01]: stumbled upon while trying to understand
photosynthetic ceiling was was a concept
[SPEAKER_01]: called photo plasticity and this allowed
me to get to my peak PPFD for day one of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower without having to go into flower
and scale it up from 600 to a thousand and
[SPEAKER_01]: what we all do and what we've all always
done is we've slowly increased these our
[SPEAKER_01]: light intensity in increments week over
week we'll go from you know 90 PPFD to 250
[SPEAKER_01]: to 450 to 650 and what's happening is
somewhere somewhere in that day where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're increasing the light your plants
hitting its DLI max and it can't take any
[SPEAKER_01]: more light in it's just doesn't have the
capacity to do it and now we start a
[SPEAKER_01]: process of photo inhibition so whether
that's 12 hours into the day 14 hours into
[SPEAKER_01]: the day 16 hours into the day there's this
block of time where your plants being
[SPEAKER_01]: smashed with light and it can't absorb it
and it's creating reactive oxygen species
[SPEAKER_01]: just to try and mitigate some of that
damage right so right there we're we're
[SPEAKER_01]: now so that's that's creating you know
chlorosis and yellowing and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: other problems that's making that's
bringing down that photosynthetic ceiling
[SPEAKER_01]: so the next day we're gonna increase the
increment but we've actually reduced the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount that plants capable of
photosynthesizing and we find ourselves oh
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I'm gonna keep my light at
450 for two weeks till it catches up or
[SPEAKER_01]: something and we find ourselves losing a
lot of time if we go day one at 120 PPFD
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the next day we bring it back
down to 90 your plant has had the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to take in all those photons but then
we've given it a chance to sit back relax
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerate with the understanding that
that light is a possibility now so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: got that reservoir filled but we're not
overloading it because now it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kicking back on an easy day and then the
next day we go up to 200 PPFD is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit stronger but it it has that capacity
and we come back the next day down to 120
[SPEAKER_01]: and we let it ease off a little bit then
the next day we're at 350 and we keep
[SPEAKER_01]: staggering our approach upwards and it
never that that continuously pushes the
[SPEAKER_01]: the physiology of the leaf photosynthetic
capability higher while not overloading it
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're not compounding this this photo
inhibition problem day over day over day
[SPEAKER_01]: and what we see is that by the time we go
from week one where we're at 90 PPFD we're
[SPEAKER_01]: in week three now and we're at 1200 and
the plants asking for more and more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more right so we can go ahead and
flip day one not losing a single day
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing the plant as hard as it can we're
on a clock right we have what 55 to 70
[SPEAKER_01]: days to flower if we're spending the first
two weeks coming up from 450 PPFD trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to hit our max during transition when
we're really trying to push that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: hard we're really behind the eight ball
now you understand right so we can save
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves that whole that whole process
just by getting it done in veg that way
[SPEAKER_01]: the day we flip we're already where we
need to be we don't even have to touch our
[SPEAKER_02]: lights anymore nope nope I mean I really
like that approach I've I've used the
[SPEAKER_02]: approach of double or not doubling but
increasing by half the PPFD day one of
[SPEAKER_02]: flower because you lose a third of your
DLI by going from 18 to 12 and so just by
[SPEAKER_02]: doubling it your your PPFD a canopy you
hit the same DLI pretty easily that way
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can in certain cultivars run into
some huge stress factors of them not being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to photosynthesize at that same rate
but some plants they just go right into it
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're fine with it as long I think I
think people tend to focus a lot on on
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD well ignoring DLI as a greenhouse
metric right when when in fact it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the most important metric we should be
measuring when we're talking about light
[SPEAKER_01]: because your plants are only capable of
eating so much light in a day right I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that metric will will go in
veg a lot of people tell me I hate veg
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers so much easier chances are you're
overloading your plant with lights and veg
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's why they look sad and purple
and and and whatever whatever you're
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting here dumping on all these
amendments and fixes and and flushing it
[SPEAKER_01]: and drying it out and turn down the light
like a little bit and you'll see it bounce
[SPEAKER_01]: back to happy as can be because we're not
paying attention to what 18 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: photons radiating a leaf does versus 12
absolutely no I am I feel like there are a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of oversights within home growers and
just like what you were talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier how there's just so much of this
stuff that was bro science or because they
[SPEAKER_02]: told me so and it works and now there's
the ability to apply a more scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: lens as well as just have a little bit
more access to information that is well
[SPEAKER_02]: formulated and it doesn't rely on because
someone told you so it it'll tell you why
[SPEAKER_02]: it works and you can look into those
processes and be like oh well this happens
[SPEAKER_02]: for all plants or this happens for all
cellular respiration or this is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it there's a lot of things I had somebody
holistic approach on I I did one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: drying posts where I tried to get the
information about what I was what I what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was trying to educate people on and one of
the things oh you referenced you
[SPEAKER_01]: referenced a paper on on rice rice isn't
cannabis and it was a directly discussing
[SPEAKER_01]: how chlorophyll behaved in the dark and I
I had referenced this paper to you earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fact of the matter is is
chlorophylls chlorophyll and it's gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: what chlorophyll does in the presence of
either light or dark it's it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule that's evolved a very specific
function whether it's in a tomato or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: in rice or it's in cannabis or it's an
algae it has a specific inherent function
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't that doesn't negate its
purpose simply because it doesn't fit your
[SPEAKER_02]: ideology right it's like we we don't know
that these different terpenes oxidize at
[SPEAKER_02]: different temperatures because we took
cannabis derived terpenes and oxidized
[SPEAKER_02]: them they these are the same
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes that you find everywhere else and
we have plenty of those what plants do and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I was being I don't know if you saw my
my my op-ed post I did a few days ago but
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended it with a little tongue-in-cheek
sort of sort of quip saying if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: verified data go follow a tomato farmer
because they don't do they don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that doesn't work there's too
much money they've invested there's too
[SPEAKER_01]: much risk stake in the game that if it
doesn't work the SOP is eliminated and if
[SPEAKER_01]: it works we're using it plain and simple
there's not it's like the generative
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative cycles of crop steering it's
like that is not at all even close to
[SPEAKER_02]: something that cannabis started with this
is what greenhouse vine tomato growers
[SPEAKER_02]: have been doing for centuries not
centuries decades sorry but this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying like there's been there's
there's there are papers from from 1977
[SPEAKER_01]: expressing how a generative Q through high
EC can increase the sugar content of your
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato right like it's not new we just
like oh this works too it's like you go to
[SPEAKER_02]: a tomato farmer and you show them a dosa
tron and they're gonna be like yeah I have
[SPEAKER_02]: like 30 of those yeah that's really silly
to think that like because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: implemented in cannabis that it is the
first of any kind it's you know there it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all just plants and we've understand a lot
of the aspects of how plants work for
[SPEAKER_02]: quite some time and so looking at those
other aspects like I said with like plant
[SPEAKER_02]: empowerment or books like hydroponic food
production all these different things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are really well written they give a lot of
great information but are not at all
[SPEAKER_02]: directly talking about cannabis exactly
especially yeah if you're going towards
[SPEAKER_02]: like a salt-based feed I would say like
hydroponic food production soil food web
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're going for something where you
want to understand the different
[SPEAKER_02]: components of the soil and how those are
going to break down the inputs that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting in that aren't readily available
to plants all these different things are
[SPEAKER_02]: well known and understood and I mean
there's still parts of them that are still
[SPEAKER_02]: being discovered but I wouldn't say
cannabis growers are the ones doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery no absolutely and that's such
that's so bang on is that like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's very very little left for us to
Eureka the agricultural world about there
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all sitting back like oh welcome
young nephew like come on in we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: here a while like you know what I mean
it's it's where we we if we if we
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize that we can utilize their
experience to our advantage and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: us are are missing that one it's like
triploid and polyploid breeding it and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's like oh look how cool this is
and it's like Monsanto enters the chat get
[SPEAKER_01]: real we've we've got about it won't
reproduce but we can still get we can
[SPEAKER_01]: still get the monetary value off it we've
been invested thank you yeah we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: invested in that yeah exactly so
[SPEAKER_02]: well let's let's go into a little bit of
what you're doing now currently we touched
[SPEAKER_02]: on it briefly at the beginning but like
run a little bit of like through your
[SPEAKER_02]: process you know you've you've created a
really good egress point to your your
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile workspace and you have some other
other cool things that you're working on
[SPEAKER_02]: in there so why don't you just talk about
it for a bit so like I said in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning I think you know I'm noticing a
paradigm shift in the industry we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got pathogens just running rampant
and and and pervasively intervening on on
[SPEAKER_01]: on our market to the point where we're
seeing we're seeing widespread damage and
[SPEAKER_01]: near destruction of whole crops and I I
think the number was somewhere like 66
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of of all plant samples tested
from a litany of facilities and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors had all tested for HLV and
and I think that we're only going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: that problem get worse and worse and worse
and I think with tissue tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: being inherently the solution to that
specific problem in the sense that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know with scalability doesn't come the
same problems as we see with with with
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation scalability right you can keep
an entire mother room of phenos the more
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you have in there the the the
higher your increased risk of pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: infection becomes scalability and labor
costs on keeping on keeping that R&D room
[SPEAKER_01]: up and running is is becoming more and
more exponential every day and as I've
[SPEAKER_01]: shown proof of concept and as tissue
culture the industry itself is showing
[SPEAKER_01]: repeatedly them when you can scale an
entire thousand light grow room with four
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand plants from a single 400 square
foot lab with minimal overhead costs next
[SPEAKER_01]: to no maintenance costs and no maintenance
labor that's just a no-brain move so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think for me what I'd like to do is I'd
like to start an elite clean sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics library that's just always
available and on stock for the breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves specifically I don't I don't I
don't want to have you know this won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: a public clone bank or anything but what
it will be is a the safe clean repository
[SPEAKER_01]: for the storage of of breeder specific
hunted phenotypes and and what I aim to be
[SPEAKER_01]: is is the go-to place for for ensuring
that the preservation of the of those
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages going forward and it you know it
won't it won't be a single serve operation
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's it's meant to preserve my
genetics or I'd like to be the Norwegian
[SPEAKER_01]: seed vault of of cannabis genetics and I
think for sure I think that with with my
[SPEAKER_01]: positioning in the market and my
relationships with a lot of a lot of great
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders my propensity to get the things
I'd like to get and do the things I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do in life I I I'm confident that I'll
be able to to build into in into that so
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm doing now is I'm starting off now
I've got all of the phenohunter green lab
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics new feminized line he's did a
collaboration with flavor genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got their entire line backed up on my
shelf now we're gonna be doing rooted
[SPEAKER_01]: plantlets I'll send a bunch back to him a
couple of the rooted plantlets we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: harden and run in my space as well and you
know and try and collect a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes back off of those and in doing
so I'm gonna advertise that that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: other other geneticists and breeders that
that would like to partake in the program
[SPEAKER_01]: that that it'll be a easily accessible you
know send in your sample I'll have it
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go when you have a room you know
say you need 2,500 plants you give me two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks notice I get you 2,500 plantlets
ready ship them out in a box and your room
[SPEAKER_01]: is ready to go so I think the the
turnaround time for for these facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: and these breeders to get to get from
order to room full filled with rooted
[SPEAKER_01]: plantlets is is game-changing as far as
reducing their overhead costs yeah we just
[SPEAKER_02]: did an episode with Jesse Locke from I
think it's Jesse Locke from Mothership
[SPEAKER_02]: Labs and they do tissue culture services
and he was showing us in the background of
[SPEAKER_02]: he had to run out to Florida to a facility
that does five million X plants a year and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was you know it's very impressive and
it's a lot of work but the the maintenance
[SPEAKER_02]: on it is where I feel like the win is
because you have such reduction in
[SPEAKER_02]: maintenance overall where it does become
this sort of like it could be a secret
[SPEAKER_02]: tool to help a lot of even the small
mom-and-pop grows well and I think I think
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic consistency in your end product
right like if you as a consumer go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary for a certain product and you
get that product and I love it and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to get that one but the next
bag came from a different plant that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly different chemo bar simply
because of abiotic factors that occurred
[SPEAKER_01]: ten tables down right that that's that's
altering your customers experience either
[SPEAKER_01]: for the better for the worse there is zero
genetic drift from a from a propagation
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective that we would see with with
ordinary cloning because especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: doing Mary stem with non vascular cell
cellular propagation meaning it's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening so fast there's that that
there's little chance for for those
[SPEAKER_01]: allelial mutations to occur in such a
small space of time so every single plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is every single genetic identical which is
when you're running a room of a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: plants I think about it for the
applications and phenohunting especially
[SPEAKER_02]: when you see that you know you've got a
keeper you want it to be your keeper yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: and and the the upkeep on you know a
thousand plant phenohunt let's say that
[SPEAKER_02]: means you need a thousand clones of it
going or a thousand moms and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: watering all of them watering lighting
everything I already think about it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a headache but if I have one single
you know 48 by 72 by 18 rack with five or
[SPEAKER_02]: six shelves on it with minimal lighting
just go with like clone lighting or
[SPEAKER_02]: something you know you could have 10,000
different X plants on there and so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: from those 10,000 X plants right I can
subculture 50,000 50,000 subcultured
[SPEAKER_01]: plantlets right and then those 10,000
plantlets are I'll either make more X
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or we'll let them we'll let them
reshoot and there's another 50,000 more in
[SPEAKER_01]: two in two weeks so it's it's it's it's
infinite plants for for minimal square
[SPEAKER_01]: footage which is the name of the game
right when when we look at our overhead
[SPEAKER_01]: costs especially especially as they scale
up any area you can reduce especially
[SPEAKER_01]: especially your energy input costs like
this one when you can go from from you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a 4,000 square foot mom room down to
like I said a 400 square foot shelving
[SPEAKER_01]: unit then then you're saving yourself 300
grand a year yeah easily on the on the
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical alone yes and in this in this
climate how do you argue that really it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard to especially considering how
the market demand changes on a weekly
[SPEAKER_02]: basis for what flavor people want on the
shelf and so we're in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: anticipate what that you need to have a
huge library to select from we've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: into this fun bloodletting era of the
industry we're no longer a cash crop
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an agricultural commodity that's
unsubsidized corn's got a leg up on you
[SPEAKER_01]: big guy so you know you gotta you gotta
make you gotta make that that those
[SPEAKER_01]: savings where you can get them yeah we
can't even row crop with seeds we're so
[SPEAKER_01]: hindered and so handcuffed by by by not
only legislation but but the market cap
[SPEAKER_01]: based on on supply and demand that you
know if if if you really want to lose a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred grand because you wanted to keep a
couple of moms around it just seems
[SPEAKER_02]: fiduciarily irresponsible right absolutely
well I feel like you've pivoted a few
[SPEAKER_02]: times just to make sure that you stay
ahead of the curve so you might be one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the perfect people to ask and and you
could approach this in either of two ways
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you feel you see changing in the
cannabis industry coming up or what would
[SPEAKER_02]: you like to see changed in the cannabis
industry and you can tackle those together
[SPEAKER_01]: or separately or just one or the other
we're heading for a reckoning one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another whether I like it or I don't like
it the genetic dilution we've seen from
[SPEAKER_01]: just years of unregulated pollen chucking
has has been detrimental there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no way around it you know the the
variety with which we're we're accustomed
[SPEAKER_01]: to now is one thing but you get this this
sense that that we've lost we've lost
[SPEAKER_01]: something along the way right with every
with every new cake cross with every new
[SPEAKER_01]: every new zittles this and candies that
everything starts to become a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: blended a little less unique a little less
defined frankly what I see happening is
[SPEAKER_01]: the closer we get to normalizing genetic
sequence editing the the better off we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: all be frankly and I know that sounds like
a scary you know you referenced Monsanto
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier and I know that sounds you know
it's a big scary evil word but when we
[SPEAKER_01]: think of GMO we only hear like the
boogeyman speak and not some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits available through through being
able to moderate what it is we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to accomplish like I said we're seeing a
massive problems with pathogens we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing huge problems with genetic
infallacies like this there's just there's
[SPEAKER_01]: just so much looseness and not that not
enough structure to preserve what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: we're off we're all so passionate about
right I think if we can get to a point
[SPEAKER_01]: where where we've got where we've got
plants that we can we can you know make
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to specific specific pathogens
and and and we can we can express specific
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant traits to better suit what it is
our customers are after at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day this isn't about like a dick measuring
contest or I'm the best grower because I
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to do it naturally the end of the
day we're just trying to we're just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide the best product to our
consumer and if we can do that with with
[SPEAKER_01]: the computer then I'm I'm for it and I
think you know while monopolizing an
[SPEAKER_01]: entire agricultural industry because
you're the most powerful company on earth
[SPEAKER_01]: has its ethical issues I don't think
that's a necessary it intrinsic inherency
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes along with with with gene
editing or or or you know sequencing our
[SPEAKER_01]: food or or or any of the technological
advances we're capable of achieving just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's used for nefarious purposes
in some instances right I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: technology is not evil inherently it's all
about the people using it absolutely then
[SPEAKER_02]: turn it into something that it wasn't
either intended for but you know part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the responsibility of even like the
creation of these new technologies and and
[SPEAKER_02]: applications and stuff is trying to
forecast what some of those uses might be
[SPEAKER_01]: who was in a position to leverage those
over over you know what what your your
[SPEAKER_01]: ideology would would suppose it would
versus what the reality of the situation
[SPEAKER_01]: is right like at the end of the day do I
have more money then then same on Santo to
[SPEAKER_01]: say I'll go and edit and patent it no
they're probably just steamroll me you
[SPEAKER_01]: know take the patent do it themselves hey
what a great idea look what we've just
[SPEAKER_01]: reintroduced so that's obviously always a
huge consideration is the ethical
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibilities that come along with with
some of these discoveries and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: these advances but at the end of the day
things move forward with or without us
[SPEAKER_01]: right and we'd rather be on the right side
of it than the wrong absolutely I couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: agree more so with with all of your
experience as well in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: different experiments that you've applied
to your gardens you know finding success
[SPEAKER_02]: in certain aspects perhaps failures and
other aspects what are some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: pitfalls that you see growers face maybe
that you faced yourself that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: help caution new growers in so one of the
biggest failing points that that tends to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a really hard learning curve despite
how many years of experience you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: this field tends to be the this this
inclination to need to baby new plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always almost detrimental to the
point where you're you're causing
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term issues that you're not going to
be able to outrun simply by over watering
[SPEAKER_01]: that little plant lit in your three three
gallon pot that's gotten over roots and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just sitting there watering soil
and this happens repeatedly over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over as even happens with experienced
cultivators who are oh i haven't watered
[SPEAKER_01]: it in two days i'd better get on it i'll
tell you a secret um i'll let i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: until i see until i see that true work
pressure start to drop and the leaves go
[SPEAKER_01]: now you're thirsty i know the roots are
out there somewhere searching for water
[SPEAKER_01]: but the entire goal of the first two weeks
of that plant's life is to establish a
[SPEAKER_01]: strong healthy vigorous root zone and the
only way to do that is to make it go find
[SPEAKER_01]: water stop watering your young plants that
don't need it a lot of people won't
[SPEAKER_02]: believe me when i say that uh from
transplant until flower i probably water
[SPEAKER_02]: twice me too and that's once and that's
once at transplant me too like i'll
[SPEAKER_01]: saturate the blocks i'll put it in i'll
water the thing here i'll see you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: week later yep saturate again and then
usually people people are always very
[SPEAKER_01]: apprehensive about that but as i've seen
time and time and time again setting them
[SPEAKER_01]: up strong with a strong foundation a good
vigorous root base is the only way to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that they're going to be taking up
the amount of water you're going to need
[SPEAKER_01]: to put on them in order to get the results
you want to get well and the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_02]: blends are so much better nowadays than
they used to be that a big reason for
[SPEAKER_02]: these high porosity blends where they
would even take cocoa add a little peat
[SPEAKER_02]: moss and then a bunch of perlite and
pumice and vermiculite to it would be to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the available air at field
capacity so that you could water every day
[SPEAKER_02]: because you needed to replenish those
nutrients that you watered the day before
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were imbalanced going in and
they're even more imbalanced now that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants used what it wants plants are
taking up and leaving some behind plus
[SPEAKER_01]: you're you're having this evaporative
these evaporative force leaving salts
[SPEAKER_01]: behind that are only exacerbating what's
now left in the root zone and that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred that's that's i try to show people
what a what a vwec and a pwec graph look
[SPEAKER_01]: like in comparison with one another and
how those how those two lines interact as
[SPEAKER_01]: as we both dry out our medium and
reconstitute it with water and adding
[SPEAKER_01]: additional ions into it once it's been
dried back and um you know how how how a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant behaves at field capacity is vastly
different from how it behaves at a dry
[SPEAKER_01]: back right because it's got to do two
entirely different things but
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how those how those things
are working inside the cocoa itself is is
[SPEAKER_01]: vastly more beneficial than just saying
okay water it to ec until 10 runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: because now you know what's happening when
we're past that runoff part you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants haven't had water in in four
hours and have dried back now an
[SPEAKER_01]: additional eight percent and what what's
happening to our pwec and what the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is doing with the ions that were in there
and now aren't like this there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: going on but at the same time it's all
relatively intuitive when you have the
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation to understand right it's like
uh you don't need to necessarily explain
[SPEAKER_02]: how much runoff you need if you can
explain to someone what that poor water
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical conductivity is doing to the
plants and how you can manipulate it with
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff then they can make that decision
themselves even if they can't read what's
[SPEAKER_02]: in the substrate they can look at the
plant and make some educated guesses as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as the stage of life that the plant
is in and go okay so i want to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plant uh gets a little bit of
stress early on lower your runoff well i i
[SPEAKER_02]: want less stress when it bulks increase
your runoff i want uh more stress at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end decrease your runoff like there's
simple things like that where it it is
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to grasp the overall concept of crop
steering so but that's actually always my
[SPEAKER_01]: very first starting point is when i'm when
i'm doing consults or i'm educating people
[SPEAKER_01]: on my on on my irrigation uh sop i say
let's let's not get stuck in the mud here
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to get all to the every
single detail and understanding how how uh
[SPEAKER_01]: you know positive ions interact we're not
doing all that let's just let's just do
[SPEAKER_01]: this you have a little dial and every time
you turn the dial up more water comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bottom of the pot and with that
come out salt and every time you dial it
[SPEAKER_01]: down less come out which make the salt in
the pot increase and the more they
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that that you can see them
visualizing in their head okay and into
[SPEAKER_01]: the and you can see them turning the dial
and now it's starting to make sense to
[SPEAKER_01]: them so like you said you don't they don't
necessarily need to understand the the
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity behind what we're trying to
express just understanding the the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanics of those of the motion that
occurs when we're when we're implementing
[SPEAKER_02]: those it's it's like uh providing the
simplistic dichotomous key where you have
[SPEAKER_02]: uh more stress or less stress you can do
that with more dry less dry you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: that with more ec less ec you can do that
with higher vapor pressure lesser vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure exactly so each one of those you
can apply this dichotomous key to so that
[SPEAKER_02]: they can say okay i just need to turn that
dial in one direction exactly they're
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing it or decreasing it um and then
the complexity of it is when you're then
[SPEAKER_02]: the dj and you're turning all the dials at
once pulling this lever this one's going
[SPEAKER_01]: but but but you've already you've already
learned how to manipulate this level lever
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's it's not it's not taking brain
power to figure okay while i'm doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: this needs to be in the down position
because that makes sense to me right right
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's it is then correlating those
different dials and how you turn it and
[SPEAKER_02]: how they affect the other dials and then
how you need to adjust those that i feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of people find the whole
concept of crop steering starts to become
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more confusing and that's where i
feel like the the learning curve lessons
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it it can increase a lot just by
understanding that all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: things can be turned towards one or the
other uh but then when you're saying well
[SPEAKER_02]: this applies to this this this this
applies to this this this that's where it
[SPEAKER_02]: can then sort of start to get harder but
if you do try to provide that holistic
[SPEAKER_02]: approach of saying but this is all like
you're all just looking at it from the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's point of view as a water pump
trying to move nutrients got to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's got to get out so you got to if
you if you try to start there and then be
[SPEAKER_02]: like okay like bring it try to bring it
back to that home base of this is what
[SPEAKER_02]: plants do how do you apply these different
things if you get a little lost just step
[SPEAKER_01]: back a little bit right back to the last
point and we could what we'll call this a
[SPEAKER_01]: staggered learning approach like you'll
never find me you'll never find me
[SPEAKER_01]: directing somebody in it like i said at
the beginning in an a to b okay we plant
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed and now we take it out of the
paper towel and we go here it's it's i'll
[SPEAKER_01]: give you a million different concepts but
by the time you're ready to use that
[SPEAKER_01]: concept in your garden we'll have already
talked about it and and and you'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll you'll put your hands into it with
that in the back of your head and it won't
[SPEAKER_02]: feel so new to you anymore right exactly
it does it does take a lot of experience
[SPEAKER_02]: to get that uh ease of motion in the
garden i would say absolutely but for a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people it will come with time and
and with uh you know listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations like this hopefully it helps
more people see that you know you just
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe there's a different thing something
that you're not thinking about that might
[SPEAKER_02]: come up that goes oh it clicks now i know
i know what they're talking about that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes so much sense or you had yeah
exactly you had just gotten to that point
[SPEAKER_01]: in your journey where now it finally does
make sense to you despite having having
[SPEAKER_01]: heard it a million times before yapping
from my mouth talking about it over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over but now you're finally there
you're at that point you've progressed
[SPEAKER_01]: past all the other things i was talking
about and they're like oh shit now i'm at
[SPEAKER_01]: this part where i gotta start worrying
about bwc i remember he was telling me
[SPEAKER_01]: about that and it's it's now less of a
less of a of a of a new door and that that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got to open and more of a
refresher like okay so i remember him
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about this that's what he was
talking about that makes sense to me so
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's how i like to approach it it's
really fun when you start to make all
[SPEAKER_02]: those connections because you can see how
they tie in with each other and it becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like if you're if you're a puzzler
uh you know it becomes this puzzle that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're putting the whole border piece yeah
and yeah you get the border in and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like all right i got it exactly what i
that's exactly how i feel about it like
[SPEAKER_01]: you sit there and you i'll spend three
hours i'm trying to find the corner but
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden you got that one border
piece in and now pieces are just starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to fill in one by one by one by one and
it's starting to starting to feel natural
[SPEAKER_01]: again right and and that's i pushed people
out of there where they were comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: growing oh i'm good i've i've gotten
harvest and i pushed them out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: comfort zone until it's comfortable again
and now this is where your comfort zone is
[SPEAKER_01]: right so we're just going to keep moving
that that that goalpost for you absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: um well so uh what what would then be like
one of like what would be the first piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of advice you would give to any new grower
so i like i like to think that that
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding understanding that concept
that your your whole goal is to fill the
[SPEAKER_01]: media with root zone with roots as opposed
to just allowing it to be empty media um
[SPEAKER_01]: will will get you a really long ways in
your grower but my biggest piece of advice
[SPEAKER_01]: like if whether you've been growing for
three years and you know you're just sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of meandering your way through and haven't
seen very much progression or this is your
[SPEAKER_01]: first ever grow quite honestly go crack
open a grade 11 biology book a grade 11
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry book and just skim through some
of the major concepts familiar familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself with things that you thought were
like that you already knew for example
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody knows what photosynthesis is
right but do you really know what
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis is go familiarize yourself
with things that you thought you already
[SPEAKER_01]: knew and don't need to know and you'll be
surprised how much information you're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to pull out of these these simple concepts
like i said when you when you dive deep
[SPEAKER_01]: and understand that yeah plants eat
sunlight but when you understand how they
[SPEAKER_01]: do it and what's happening inside and
where that energy goes and what you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to do to maintain that cycle then all of a
sudden you're like you have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of why you need to it
eliminates so many different whys for you
[SPEAKER_01]: so now i understand why i need a high ppfd
proper spectrum grow light now i
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how water moves in the plant
and it's by by doing understanding these
[SPEAKER_01]: core concepts that we didn't think we
really needed to know because we're not in
[SPEAKER_01]: grade 11 high school anymore um you find
that it eliminates a lot of the questions
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to come up for you as
you're progressing through this journey
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely that i don't think i could have
said it better myself at building these
[SPEAKER_02]: foundations and then building upon those
foundations and you know always trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring yourself back to the basics if you
can if you start to feel yourself getting
[SPEAKER_01]: lost it it helps tremendously if you don't
understand something take it one step back
[SPEAKER_01]: where did we get lost right this where was
the last place i was comfortable and let's
[SPEAKER_01]: go from there and we'll keep working back
problems or treasures right like i said
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier we we have the ability to be wrong
which gives us the ability to be right
[SPEAKER_01]: about being wrong right we get to correct
that and no longer be wrong about that
[SPEAKER_01]: thing so if you're one of those people
that just hates to be wrong it has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: right all the time being wrong is good for
you right mistakes are only mistakes if
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't learn from them precisely yep
well you know this has been a wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: talk and uh i just have a few little
wrap-up questions for you that i like to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask everyone that comes on the podcast
sure um so what's your favorite strain of
[SPEAKER_01]: all time so i had a ken estes original
granddaddy purple um that i don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you remember like going to the grocery
store the toy store as a kid and they had
[SPEAKER_01]: those balls that smelled like like they
were bouncy balls and they smelled like
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon cherry fruit watermelon all those
they had like a really plasticky flavored
[SPEAKER_01]: smell this smelled exactly like that grape
ball when you open the jar you'd smell
[SPEAKER_01]: that like toy grape smell and i can't get
it out of my head so that sticks out as
[SPEAKER_01]: like my favorite phenotype of all time my
favorite just general cultivar in general
[SPEAKER_01]: is lamb's breath um it's an older sativa
that comes right out of jamaica i believe
[SPEAKER_01]: bob marley had something to do with it but
it's got this this very very gassy um
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbon diesel flavor to it it's yeah
very hard to find nowadays i chase it
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere but alas no luck yet oh man
that brings back memories i'm from the bay
[SPEAKER_02]: area and uh there's this dispensary that
's been there forever harborside and they
[SPEAKER_02]: used to get ken estes granddaddy purple
grown by him uh back in like man 0809 or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that and it was memorable
to say it was it was the top shelf at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time for sure it was and lamb's red too or
lamb's breath you know whichever one uh
[SPEAKER_02]: people are used to that one you know i've
heard stories of where it was just that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what uh anything grown in an area was was
called if it came out of jamaica but a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of it seemed very similar to me when i
would try yeah so it all has this very um
[SPEAKER_01]: i can't really pin the smell but it's like
it's it's it's like jet fuel like a skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: fell into a jet fuel tank and it's it's
it's very very you like you open it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like yeah that's that's the guy for
sure and it must be the terroir um and
[SPEAKER_01]: those jamaican hillsides if if that's
what's coming out but you know again with
[SPEAKER_01]: with tissue culture one of one of the main
benefits is some of that uh some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetic refreshing that that can be
done and if if anybody's got any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: land races laying around i'm happy to take
a sample and bring it back to to its
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorous life nice nice that's awesome um
well so uh of course to follow up favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: strain uh as a grower um if you had to
reach for a pack of seeds what breed are
[SPEAKER_01]: you reaching for so obviously i've got a
couple of favorites that i've that i've
[SPEAKER_01]: run with uh for a while um green lab
genetics where he's a good friend of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's an exceptional breeder with a
great eye that being said you know
[SPEAKER_01]: relentless genetics just puts in we're not
even particularly friends um we we used to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a pretty close working relationship
um whatever happened happened i guess but
[SPEAKER_01]: that takes away nothing from from his
skill his attention to detail and his his
[SPEAKER_01]: um diligence as a breeder not everybody is
willing to put in the work necessary to to
[SPEAKER_01]: get such uniformity and consistency out of
the the top level work that they do um but
[SPEAKER_01]: relentless genetics is definitely near the
top of the chain when it comes when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to that um for sure he i hope he
continues to do the amazing work he's done
[SPEAKER_02]: i mean for purples and uh consistency and
in purples and uh just like really
[SPEAKER_02]: photogenic weed that's uh usually like
frosty and very uh pungent uh you know
[SPEAKER_02]: i've never really had a relentless
genetics uh cut or seed or anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: i've grown out where it didn't reek of
something delicious so yeah his
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency is pretty great with that guy
i'm looking forward to seeing um what
[SPEAKER_01]: chris lynch puts out um with compound or
not with um what's his new what's his new
[SPEAKER_01]: uh cipher sorry cipher yeah cipher
genetics that that blue lobster like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything he touches personally looks
good i can't i can't especially speak for
[SPEAKER_01]: what makes it to market some of the some
of the the people he's surrounded himself
[SPEAKER_01]: with have uh have some predatory uh
tendency tendencies in this in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry with this market but yeah the
stuff that he personally builds and grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and finds um you know i put him up there
as some of the some of the the best
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders on earth for sure definitely yeah
i'd agree with that um all right just one
[SPEAKER_02]: more so uh you've been probably consuming
cannabis i assume before you were uh
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it so let's talk about your most
memorable cannabis related experience
[SPEAKER_01]: first time i ever smoked for sure all
right tell me about it um i was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what let's skip that story it's
not as interesting because i just realized
[SPEAKER_01]: this the one where i didn't even smoke yet
uh was interesting so all right my stepdad
[SPEAKER_01]: used to smoke cigarettes occasionally um
and we'd go fishing every monday night and
[SPEAKER_01]: stage two in the morning i'd do my thing
little kid running around fishing he'd sit
[SPEAKER_01]: there hacking his darts or whatever
fishing like a like like you know dads do
[SPEAKER_01]: and this would go on for my entire
childhood and as i got older i you know i
[SPEAKER_01]: started hanging out with friends and one
day and by myself with my friend mike
[SPEAKER_01]: ellie and we're driving around in a car
and his car and we pull up to another
[SPEAKER_01]: person's car in a parking lot and he
passes him uh what i thought was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette and i'm not even 14 yet like i
turned 14 that winter or whatever and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: summer and i'm still a 13 year old kid and
he passes him the cigarette through the
[SPEAKER_01]: window and he smokes it and i remember
catching a whiff of it and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the movies you saw everything just
play backwards every time i saw my dad my
[SPEAKER_01]: stepdad put that joint in his mouth
because the the olfactory flood that i got
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling it like mother fucker that wasn't
cigarettes because he i had just seen
[SPEAKER_01]: finally that he had been smoking weed in
front of me this whole time and
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately and it all clicked and i just
it was just such an epiphany for me that
[SPEAKER_01]: that um i i think that that that kid was
the first person i had ever ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking with uh next in his same car but
just just the shock the instantaneous sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of visceral knowledge that that comes
flooding back when you got that first
[SPEAKER_01]: smell was something i'll never forget for
sure did so you uh did you like ask your
[SPEAKER_02]: friend what is that he's like oh it's weed
man and instantly that changed everything
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're like i sat i sat violently
in the back seat just dumbfounded like
[SPEAKER_01]: what i had no idea i thought my stepdad
was like a straight edge guy you know just
[SPEAKER_01]: um and it turns out that he was just as
cool as the rest of us so um it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: changed my and i think i was a little
nervous to approach my stepdad for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: about it but so like for a while it was
just that i know you know kind of deal
[SPEAKER_01]: that's um but eventually obviously you
know we we ended up um you know sharing a
[SPEAKER_01]: dupe or two together and it was it was a
quite a coming-of-age experience for sure
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure no that's a i mean i feel like
there's a cinematic nature to that with
[SPEAKER_02]: the realization and the you know hanging
out with stepdad on the weekends getting
[SPEAKER_02]: uh you know going fishing and him lighting
lighting up a cigarette you know that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could almost see it playing out yeah you
could you could definitely hear the
[SPEAKER_02]: scratch it at home yeah oh that's great
well shark this has been a great interview
[SPEAKER_02]: uh tell flower fox i really appreciated
her joining us as well um you know we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do more of these in the future
maybe do some deep dives on some specific
[SPEAKER_02]: topics and and just get more information
out there to people because uh you are a
[SPEAKER_01]: smart guy you put in the effort like i
said i've uh i've not i've not had plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ground for a little while i
definitely miss talking shop i don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can tell but i certainly just uh
love hanging around just just chewing the
[SPEAKER_01]: fat it's it's one of the things i'm
passionate about so you know anytime you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have me back i'm more than happy
and welcome awesome well you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations like these that help other
people learn more and uh apply that
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and like i like to say that's
the way we grow and that's why the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: is called what it is so again thank you so
much and uh yeah we'll talk soon well
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you for having me i appreciate it
very much and i look forward to doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: again awesome honest Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
