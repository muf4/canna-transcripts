[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow Podcast, a production of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Nick Wolfe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, our guest is Jarrett Ritchie of
Next Big Crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jarrett, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came highly recommended by one of our
former guests, Jesse of Mothership Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to have someone else on here
who's as professional as he is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but from a different angle of what you're
applying that cannabis knowledge to in
[SPEAKER_00]: your professional life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you tell the audience a
little bit about your background and what
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Big Crop is and what you do there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess in a former life, I was a
secondary social studies teacher and
[SPEAKER_01]: bartender for years and stuff like that
before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I graduated college and then moved out
to Denver, I guess it's almost 18-ish or
[SPEAKER_01]: so years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I moved out here and then I got a job
at this really cool bar in this
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood spot that had live music,
three, five nights a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those small things that really change your
life forever kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that bar Highland Pacific, we used to
joke it was almost like Highland Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Wellness Center at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a whole lot of town and
gardeners and just music people and just
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of all walks of life there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got that job and I went back to
school to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a social studies degree and I went
back to get my education sort of degree as
[SPEAKER_01]: well to be a teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was bartending and going to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the owners was like,
you want to come trim for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he kind of drug me up the hill to
Netherlands where they added some houses,
[SPEAKER_01]: was going and started trimming for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then real quick after that,
I was like, well, I want my own lights and
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do this on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started doing that while I finished my
teaching degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like bartend at night and go to
school during the day and somehow started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a bunch of weed in between,
you know, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I think I hit it for my friends
for about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was doing before somebody kind of
finally figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I finished my teaching degree and
started teaching and I realized that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really want to sort of continue
with that, I called a buddy at one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: local hydro shops way to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, coach, you hire me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be a teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going on a fish tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then pretty much, yeah, it was one of
the like they had a happy hour for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: all the teachers and they were like,
like trying to on like a Friday,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get me to like commit to taking
this job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I skipped that happy hour and I went
and hung up eight lights in a friend's
[SPEAKER_01]: garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that Monday I started working at
way to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, we could talk about way
to grow and that sort of education as we
[SPEAKER_01]: continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, that was like a it was
like way to grow university.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really kind of a whole lot of like like
minded people doing a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working at the same stores, doing
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked there for a good four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had lots of projects going on
here, kind of like passion projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you sort of hit that point where
you're like just getting tired of sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the counter at way to grow and
solving everybody else's problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you sort of develop this
like process of deduction sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: procedure instincts, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just come up and sort of dump their
problems on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to help them solve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I applied for a job at a local local
grow here in town and wait for next big
[SPEAKER_01]: crop was actually managing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were kind of like, you're a little
overqualified for the position we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe two, three months later,
I got a job interview with next big crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The group, you know, the consulting group
that was managing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got a job in extra crop to sort
of manage that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a spot up in Glenwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like beautiful greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it turned into a big like 50,000
square foot spot in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a super educational
experience with a really good crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like next big crop wrote all the
applications for this group, Greenleaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in like Maryland and then
Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, or maybe New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of designed all their spots,
you know, filled it up, taught them how to
[SPEAKER_01]: operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sold to Columbia Care.
[SPEAKER_01]: For like a couple hundred million dollars
kind of thing after a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a big one, like definitely
feather in the hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I think we designed and
started operating with them like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, just shy, probably 200,000
square foot kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they really turned it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since then, you know,
did Oklahoma and next big crop was part of
[SPEAKER_01]: a publicly traded company called General
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when some of the laws changed about
publicly traded companies actually owning
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of cannabis businesses, they were
about to sell us to one of the competitors
[SPEAKER_01]: because they wanted to go into a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So myself and now my two partners,
Rich and Christian, sort of decided to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: next big crop away and went private from
General Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, I think August will be four
years or maybe five years at this point
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've been private and away from the
publicly traded group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in that time, you have done all
kinds of all kinds of stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much every, you know, just really
depends like where we meet a client in
[SPEAKER_01]: their journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some application writing,
some financial models and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we would design facilities for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have engineers and like, you know,
depending on, you know, building from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground up or, you know, sort of a retrofit
to something else that was already
[SPEAKER_01]: existent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then from all the way to
grow years sort of had all those contacts
[SPEAKER_01]: with every sort of supplier and rep and
nutrient company and lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much have every wholesale
account you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we sort of will outfit those
facilities with all the equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: spec all the stuff, you know, do like P
&ID, like, you know, irrigation designs,
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation stuff, like all the building
management systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lots of these spots with like
competitive new markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like Colorado or California,
Oregon, Washington, where there's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: that legacy work that had been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I started getting on planes and
flying out there and teaching people how
[SPEAKER_01]: to run their facilities kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did that for a handful of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess sort of still do that till
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now we're just a little bit more
selective of who we work with and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the projects, you know, you have to
make sure everybody's like same values,
[SPEAKER_01]: equal vision, like that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really kind of whatever somebody needs
we have done and will continue to assist.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to take on a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the, you know, the vision doesn't
align with what you can provide,
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes people want to like do
something that's so esoteric or like very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, they want that uniqueness
to be their sort of brand and their stamp
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're putting on the product that's
coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a lot of aspects, these legacy
practices are not sustainable in the
[SPEAKER_00]: current market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to find people that
are willing to change and understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is ways to improve and that
maybe their secret sauce isn't that
[SPEAKER_00]: secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and also just like, you know,
we don't need to reinvent the wheel here
[SPEAKER_01]: either kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there really is sort of like that,
you know, every situation is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every single one is different,
but there really has to like sort of be
[SPEAKER_01]: this like sort of optimal like execution
of this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like sometimes people think that
I'm going to come in and do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, you know, and like share on
paper, maybe that not even on paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe just like in fantasy, that sounds
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: On paper, it makes whatever is much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in reality, like it doesn't when
it comes to some of these more like
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial competitive situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I don't know, like don't
get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to fantasize about all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you're like, yeah, it's
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's costly to make mistakes or to not
have that right vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like really is a lot of thinking and
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have the ability to talk about any
people that were looking to become your
[SPEAKER_00]: clients that you had to turn down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't even need to necessarily
name them, but perhaps some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were trying to achieve that were
untenable and just not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible with either what they had
available to them for resources or in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, you know, if it was something
where it was just like, this is poor
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and you shouldn't be doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's your sticking point,
then we're out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I guess one, some of the,
you know, maybe 10 and 15 years ago when
[SPEAKER_01]: it was more of a competitive market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say competitive, I mean like
limited licenses going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would throw money at you sort of
without thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people could raise one to 10,
whatever, however many millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of build these spaceships,
if you will, to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it's not quite the same as
today as it is then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of people sort of have
these grand visions, but they really don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the capital to back it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really have the experience to
back it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so again, it's like,
sure, dude, you could throw up 10 lights
[SPEAKER_01]: in the garage with your buddies over a
weekend, but you can't do that with 500
[SPEAKER_01]: lights when the city's inspecting you,
the fire marshal inspecting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like there's all of that sort of
compliance that has to go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say like the biggest hangout is
people really, you know, the dream of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they want it to be kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like people don't realize how
much it really costs to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, lots of people, you know,
now you have lawyers, you have CPAs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have all of this stuff that kind of
goes along with it in like that
[SPEAKER_01]: professional world that you don't have
with like a passion project at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be like, that's probably the
biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are people trying to show,
you know, one of those things of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can fit this much light because you
have this much power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your HVAC, you know, everything's got
to fit numbers wise, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for these facilities to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could be like the best grower in
the world, but you don't have enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, dehumidification to have control
or, you know, so trying to sort of balance
[SPEAKER_01]: like the fantasy versus reality versus
true expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're never going to hit three and
four pounds every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be hiccups.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so just people having the
realistic understanding of sort of how
[SPEAKER_01]: hard it is to, you know, to sort of hit
repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the biggest, you know,
and I guess some of the new stuff is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm going to do autos from,
you know, which I love whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but again, yeah, there's just
like, I guess the new, the new,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to read, you know, I'm going to
reinvent the game and all this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, no, man, like, don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these ideas are totally real.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are executing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've never done this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to sort of gamble on something so
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That almost like helps to set up people's
expectations within reason so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: know that, you know, and we see this all
the time too, whenever we'll all go and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at another facility or something and
people are asking for help that they'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they'll be like, this is my
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the goal does not match what
you have available to achieve that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And setting up more reasonable
expectations for what you already have
[SPEAKER_00]: available is so crucial because you can
create, you know, I haven't seen a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that doesn't have the ability to
create awesome product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, is that they have to be okay
with either a quantity of awesome product
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, may not be what they were
originally hoping for, which kind of can
[SPEAKER_00]: temper some expectations down a little bit
where they're going, oh man, I really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to, you know, 10X my investment
within the first two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going, that's going to be maybe
five to 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're lucky and you don't have crop
loss after crop loss due to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of HVAC or you're, you're using your
reuse of soil, if you're in some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like living soil facility or, you know,
your input costs are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you initially bought this giant
pallet of inputs, you know, five years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been sitting there and working
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to look into buying it
again, it's going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10X the cost that it was five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also one of the biggest ones is I feel
like right along the lines, what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying is like when, when markets open the
price per pound is however high,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as more facilities open,
you know, I don't even know where we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to start with that number, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, if you can't basically
sell your pounds at a thousand dollars a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound and still be profitable with that,
you know, like you can still run a
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable business at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it costs you 800 bucks to grow a
pound and the markets really only offering
[SPEAKER_01]: six to $800 a pound for that, you know,
that, that sort of model that you gave all
[SPEAKER_01]: your investors a year or two years prior
is just like irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably one of the hardest
things to get everybody on the same page
[SPEAKER_01]: with is kind of like sort of understanding
the cost of that operation versus what,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the pound, you know, when the market
gets flooded and it comes down,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, where's that balance
point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Oklahoma is a great example and
case study for anybody that wants to look
[SPEAKER_00]: into where it started and where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened so quickly, you know,
like I feel like Oregon and California,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they did have, you know,
massive booms in production, when
[SPEAKER_00]: everything went legal and recreational,
the price never plummeted as fast in such
[SPEAKER_00]: a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we, we're all still now
around the same price across the country
[SPEAKER_00]: and unfortunately, but it took us a decade
to get there versus 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, did a lot of work in
Oklahoma when that sort of went off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like you should say, like,
you know, everybody's got their own
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts about this, that would have been
like in Oklahoma, there was like two
[SPEAKER_01]: agents or sort of, there's something like
that for the whole state and they gave out
[SPEAKER_01]: 13,000 some licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no inspections.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no, whatever, you know,
like basically, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we built a really beautiful greenhouse for
a client that we operated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the only rules were basically
like, you could do whatever you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, as long as it was behind a fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I filled up an acre and did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did what I could, you know, and yeah,
next summer, yeah, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, we had 4,000 some pounds on the
one acre, you know, and that was just one
[SPEAKER_01]: acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew of farms that had 50 and yeah,
there was the stories of the guys with 500
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, so at that point,
there was more product there than,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in a short time than anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it's still not even recreational,
is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they shot that down on medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, without interstate commerce,
it's just like, I mean, of course there's
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit interstate commerce going on and,
and backdooring and all this other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that like, how could it not?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not, you don't see giant,
you know, thousand pound bonfires of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis going off all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gotta go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Oklahoma is a huge state and like,
yeah, I'm sure the people like say it
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, like almost everybody we
worked with, they'd be like, I own my
[SPEAKER_01]: property, you know, tell them to come out
here and tell me I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like in Oklahoma, nobody wanted
to pull permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buddies down the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to help them build whatever,
you know, so for all the license stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows how much unlicensed work is also
done that fed those markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's pretty crazy to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with more states coming online all the
time, you know, there, there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: other potentials for something like that
to happen where you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a set cost of entry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of the size of the facility you
want to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can basically go in there with,
you know, like you're saying like $10
[SPEAKER_00]: million in capital, spend a tiny amount on
the licensure and just blow up a space,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it would, and then,
you know, sure, you might have this
[SPEAKER_00]: spaceship to operate, but man,
in a saturated market like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels like, you know, your,
your talent pool is going to be diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your, um, your overhead costs are going
to, going to skyrocket after the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the short interval of time in
which people realize that there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous demand for certain perishables
and consumables that all of a sudden is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, you know, they're,
they're going to deplete their stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to restock all those
things and they're going to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I'm going to up my price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this many people want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, um, I had a handful of
friends from Colorado all run out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma because they couldn't legally
work in the industry here because they had
[SPEAKER_01]: felonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Oklahoma, there was no regulatory,
whatever to who could run and operate
[SPEAKER_01]: these gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like there's probably
cultivators from all over California,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of like our legacy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're saying out West, they were
like, yo, here's my chance to get back in
[SPEAKER_01]: legally and went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were probably a bunch of talented
guys running these gardens, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that had that experience and were like
able to pull off what they, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could walk the walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then sort of, again, quickly their
dreams or what they were promised didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so then things turned to that gray
area for a lot of those projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and it's really fascinating
because the people that I do see operating
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oklahoma still, and, uh, like
maintaining a certain amount of success
[SPEAKER_00]: are extremely small farms, like,
you know, 20 lighters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like something where they're just pulling
off five really good harvests a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe pulling 50, 60 pounds out
of it, and then offering other sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: classes and educational material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the cost of living in Oklahoma
being what it is, you know, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive pretty comfortably off of,
you know, sub hundred K, uh, income per
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you already own the property or
land, you're pretty comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our, um, some really good friends,
I guess, sort of, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys from here, from college Denver that
went to Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a it's one of the larger,
I guess, maybe sort of groups in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called Evo cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know you folk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Omead and Wes, I don't know,
Omead's a real good homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they put out really good, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, they put out really good
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they've sort of been able to
expand and, you know, again, they started
[SPEAKER_01]: out more of like trying to do like an
extraction sort of facility extraction lab
[SPEAKER_01]: for like their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's partnership didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we designed them, they're 20,
their first 20,000 square foot spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then they just took it and ran,
you know, did what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and then they've expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I feel like they're, I don't know,
I guess, you know, you're sort of proud of
[SPEAKER_01]: your certain friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, y'all did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like kind of thing, putting out that type
of work at that scale and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, there are probably those other
big examples, similar to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, I don't know if I was in
Oklahoma, that's what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're, they're, they were such
nice people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met them over in, uh, in San Jose,
California at a craft farmer meetup for
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about prop steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was a meet and his lead
grower were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, uh, it was awesome to talk to
them and hear what they were doing and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they like developed in Colorado and then
took that to Oklahoma and were one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more popular brands already on the shelves
of the different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that sort of level of
understanding all the different aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: like compliance and, um, like the build
out and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just, it seemed like they were
able to go execute and get it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: market in such a good way that they,
it's cool to see something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's still around because a lot of
the brands kind of came and went like
[SPEAKER_00]: flashes in the pan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we designed their spot with them,
um, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually built pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, like when it comes to all
your dosatron and, uh, like all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plumbing, you know, like we did all that
plumbing design work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually built it themselves kind of
thing, like, you know, getting pictures of
[SPEAKER_01]: them covered in the purple glue and stuff
like that, you know, um, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like they built it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like a built, not brought,
built, bought, not bought brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so like just on a super
proud of them kind of thing, you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's sort of celebrate what they pulled
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you sort of, we still share
a whole bunch of genetics with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that actually, I was just talking to
a me the other day about the eight inch
[SPEAKER_00]: bagel and he was saying that he got it
from his buddy in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw it on your, uh,
on your list of genetics that you offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is actually a great
segue into the next thing that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of touch base with you about and
learn more about is the I party with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jarrett collection, your, uh, your
genetics list that you curate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so tell us more about that and sort of
what, uh, what got that going and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, where your inspiration comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of always been a call it a
collector kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I think I started growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This in like 2007, 2008, um, when I first
moved here, um, you know, probably touch
[SPEAKER_01]: plants every day since, unless you like
leave the country or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I feel like sort of, yeah,
sort of when I first started, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, sort of like two camps that I was
like working with kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, one, uh, it was a bunch of
Southern dudes from Arkansas, like John
[SPEAKER_01]: and Chuck and GMAC and Jason, you know,
they gave me my first plants and lights
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other was, uh, you know,
one of the bar owners and sort of his
[SPEAKER_01]: sensei master queue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I basically, I was going to school
and doing work for everybody, sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: apprenticing under them, you know,
learning and, um, the guys from the South
[SPEAKER_01]: just always had better genetics and grew
better weed than anybody else in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so like, kind of like started to
really get into it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a picture somewhere I could find
it and send it to you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like out of all the, you know,
packages you would get from people,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always pull a gram out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in a little analogy jar and label
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at one point there was like a hundred,
some different jars of different genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that I bought and shared with friends and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't like all stacked up like a
Jenga pile kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could sort of always love genetics
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then as you know, you sort of do
it a little bit longer and you start like
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping your own mothers instead of
getting clones from friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, then you sort of start getting
into like popping seeds for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I sort of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a collector, um, just cause like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the fun, you know,
it's part of the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you start doing it more,
you realize that that kind of like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that separates you and makes
your product more memorable, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I guess sort of in some of the older
days when you would have a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: passion projects yourself kind of thing,
you know, and everything's going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled, you know, like, um, when your
work gets selected first, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: part of it's because of the quality of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it was caused like diversity of
genetics and like, you know, sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: always had stuff that none of my friends
had, um, you know, cause I would go hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and that's going back 16,
17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so fast forward, you know,
sort of came friends with another dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, chef in town, Johnny,
like the knife is what we call him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's when it really started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we really started popping lots
of seeds kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I saw this one strain called cookie
rec that I've had now since I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: popped that seed in 2011, maybe shared it
three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like a special something as
I've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, even back then kind of
started popping seeds and holding genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of, I would end up feeding all my
friends gardens clones kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, as far back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, I guess, you know,
going back to a little bit, what next to
[SPEAKER_01]: crop does, we outfit these facilities and
then I would show up on site and sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd have numbers that we'd have to hit
right out of the gate to make everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so started bringing my genetics with
me so that I knew what I was doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: like right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so sort of like those genetics were
sort of just supplied to sort of clients
[SPEAKER_01]: or more of a private situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and at this point, as things have
loosened up a little bit, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm like sort of holding,
you know, 50, 60, 80, a hundred moms kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing to hold your whole library is a
ton of work, you know, kind of thing when
[SPEAKER_01]: it just comes to all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't realize how hard it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, the facility I'm at and
it's, Oh, it's a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of repopulation, making sure you have
enough stuff at the right time,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the whole, I party with Jared,
you know, I guess when we got all these
[SPEAKER_01]: trade shows, you know, for all the
cannabis trade shows, people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I were like, I'm like, Oh,
we're going to go party with these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to go party with the
Canada team.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go party with whoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so then somebody inside the company,
uh, actually a dude named John,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's one of the current in reps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you should meet John as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Oh, we're a party with Jared
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, uh, that's where that sort of
name came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, sort of started joking about
how I sponsor artists and athletes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, you know, people that are really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, they're part of the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's basically back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so now sort of trying to do
like, here's my 18 strains kind of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for the fall season, winter season,
spring season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you kind of like, here's this menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's available now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we'll have a spring,
we'll have a summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like every basically three,
four months that list changes to like the
[SPEAKER_01]: next set of 20 kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sort of try to set up a subscription
program now kind of thing, just so we
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a little more prepared as well as
like our sort of clients can be prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so if somebody wants one strain
every 90 days, they can sign up for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody wants two strains every 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have one person that wants
four strains a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so it's just like,
you almost have like your sushi menu and
[SPEAKER_01]: you sort of like, you know, you're signed
up for their X amount or whatever cadence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you just sort of, this is what
you're going to get every 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you kind of get your cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they're like, yeah, the garden
staff cultivation team can plan that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, two new things coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sales team can also then be prepared,
the marketing team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of try to get everybody
like aligned in that, uh, here's the new,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what we're going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not have to go pop all the seeds and
hunt for themselves and all the work and
[SPEAKER_01]: question marks that comes with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, these are proven genetics that
run in commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your COA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your cheat sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, you know, and it's sort of trying
to become friends with all the guys at all
[SPEAKER_01]: the gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, yeah, or like I, you know,
so it's like, yo, here's my number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you however I can sort of help
with like a little bit of growers notes,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, as well.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of something we just sort
of launched in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sorta seems like it's going pretty
well so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, it's just a way from
where sort of, you know, sort of all these
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation teams to just be like,
cool, I got two, two new strains coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: every 60 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can sort of make their
garden fresh with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's also really beneficial
to see from a commercial standpoint that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is commercially viable because,
you know, there are a lot of popular
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that you get in, uh, nowadays,
like that you may be sourcing from someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who is some sort of, uh, popular curator
of flavors and their style of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: might be, you know, kind of what we
touched on earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be this esoteric unique,
um, you know, maybe, maybe they don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: like any sort of, uh, substrate monitoring
or anything, and they're using these
[SPEAKER_00]: massive pots and running their plants
vegetative the entire cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how you get the morphology
of the flower that they're sending you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you're putting it into a facility
that's running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small like one gallon cocoa pots using
substrate monitoring, high EC feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to match all of these
other parameters that you're used to
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out into this, you know,
big old booth stick or something along
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines where it just doesn't work out
in your parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by having someone like yourself,
who's also then connected to multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities that are running different
styles of growing that you've seen similar
[SPEAKER_00]: or the same cultivar run in already,
you can provide super accurate data to
[SPEAKER_00]: people to say, listen, if you are running
it in a small substrate, then you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: really drive your P2s for bulking,
or you really need to, um, you really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you're running a super
generative environment all the way from
[SPEAKER_00]: start to finish, because it does not do
well in high humidity, mid flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, just different things like
that, where you can, you can really help
[SPEAKER_00]: people hone it in and not misstep when
they intake new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for me, one of the biggest things
is when running new genetics, I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw like nine plants in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one light worth of, of this genetics,
because I'm like, I'll test light it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, sometimes when I
see, you know, you're, you're by day 40
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like, this is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but you've already dedicated,
you know, two months to this plant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to ride it all the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at this point, you're not going to
lose all the yield potential from all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that input and overhead that you've put
into even that one light, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still in today's market, a significant
portion of a yield in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real estate on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, oh man, it's frustrating to
take in genetics that then don't work out
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you want, or that you run them,
let's say outdoor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, man, this yielded
great for me outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The returns on the hash were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile, the color,
the structure all did really well in an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw it indoors and it, you know,
throws intersex traits or people have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that works great inside and then
they go outside with it and fill up poop
[SPEAKER_01]: houses or fill up fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it doesn't do
what they thought, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, both, both ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It cuts both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really necessarily take an
outdoor and run it indoor and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: take an indoor and run it outdoor and
expect the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes they do work out and there
are strains that definitely do great,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a super boof, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, outdoor, it does the same thing
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to yield significantly for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, something like, what's one,
like, like some of the different grape
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, you'll run it outdoor and it'll
yield great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't throw intersex traits, have,
you know, phenomenal terpenes and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, throw it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeding out your whole room and
it's, it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're sort of scary or whatever,
you know, and like I've dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody's, anybody's like, hasn't dealt
with this yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question how much plants you plant work
you really do, but like all the viruses at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point that come with genetics and all
the skeletons that come with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe test regularly with Tumi Genomics
out of Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Tassa, like, you know, they're just as
kind and great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sort of on the cutting edge too of
all like SOPs for HLBD tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're testing and all of the others,
you know, full panel, whatever else you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do, you know, they'll take care of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we test stuff regularly with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess sort of our mutual friend,
Jesse Leach and Mothership Labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: like on full Maris sub dissections across
the whole library.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, these plants have this vigor
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even cutting branches, cutting clones off
this, these plants that have come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: dissection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like take your scissors and you go right
through it and you're like, this feels
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know, try not to just have
like, like I said, everything's tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's been through Maris sub
dissection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say, you're kind of like
done everything we can to provide the
[SPEAKER_01]: people with something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like all those different steps that
you're taking to provide like clean
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are well tested,
that have been proven in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of see how the phenotype
changes over those different environments
[SPEAKER_00]: and the different operators and how they
have their own unique kind of ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with things in the grow that
produce different structures and
[SPEAKER_00]: morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get back to what you said earlier a
little bit, like sometimes people are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I run, insert whatever nutrients,
this size container under these kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, huh, we have a client
that does the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of hears pictures from their
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really can kind of offer that sort
of specifics to go along with them to
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I don't know, that's sort of
the new fun thing that we've been working
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did some breeding work, really excited to
start popping a bunch of new seeds to sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of refill that list with stuff that's
going to be like one of one we've made
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you, I'm guessing you got a full
fridge of seeds, more seeds than you could
[SPEAKER_01]: have kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really excited to get to kind of
thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, like, you know,
like I said, the list cycles about every
[SPEAKER_01]: four months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way that like, you know,
the people that have subscribed kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, you know, again, depending on the
cadence that they want stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: realistically that next list is going to
have turned over and they get to pick off
[SPEAKER_01]: that menu again and sort of just try to
keep everybody like fresh and excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about what's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, bring back like some
of the older nostalgic stuff, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, got like a pre-98 Bubba that's,
you know, in dissection and Durbin poison
[SPEAKER_01]: and dissection, some old chem stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, there's the new hype and whatever,
but also like that building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that nostalgic work, you know,
that sort of love and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I'm sure you're thinking the same
thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I could have this back,
you know, especially going back,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, near a couple of decades of
work, you know, there's certain things
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been lost for a while that,
you know, you would do just about anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to have back at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully at this point, never losing
anything again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, cause we'll be able to store
it on a shelf in a vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, the huge benefit of tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, um, I'm a huge advocate of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's come up so many times now on the show
that, you know, we have, we've had Jesse
[SPEAKER_00]: on and we've had, uh, one of our,
you know, he is great and he's super
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of our co-hosts cosmic,
he also does tissue culture at home so
[SPEAKER_00]: that he can, uh, maintain a large library
for his breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I do tissue culture at work and,
uh, it's, you know, it's just one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things that it is going to be a part,
a huge part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anybody that's still trying to
push back against it, I'm going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that your time's coming and it's
going to, you're going to, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like at this point too,
like, I don't know, I don't say it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: more inspiring than running the big
gardens or whatever, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is something really cool about how
specific and concentrated your work is,
[SPEAKER_01]: like every knife stroke and it's just so
concentrated that like, it really shows
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of your work and how much
attention to detail you pay to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's not like, you're like,
oh, that, that plan is going to veg for
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get to be a little bit
sloppy and sort of make up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you're under a microscope
doing like surgical work almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think it's really cool that it's
like so specific and clean and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they put on your headphones and
get under a hood and just like go to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, you get in that tunnel
and trance of it and sort of just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's a, I mean, it is all
propagation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But cloning for me is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing clones and, and you know,
making those, that perfect tray of clones
[SPEAKER_00]: is really satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to like filling up a bunch of
vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I was, you know, if I'm going to
hire somebody, um, one of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like easiest way is to sort of see
how good they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like how consistent their work is and
like, you're like, you know, cut a tray of
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 for me, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like sort of their, their clone work
will really show how detailed or how sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of consistent or how much control they'll
have of the entire garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, you know, fill a tray and
that'll, that'll tell you just about
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you need to know about how
talented somebody is in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always look at the cutting board that
they bust out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have two lines on the cutting
board that I'm super happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this even like just consistent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even just going back to like,
you know, getting into like the garden a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, you're like, you know,
like your mothers and the clones set the
[SPEAKER_01]: pace for the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have such like sort of
specific timelines and deadline,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of thing to everything in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if your clones are slow out of the
gate, it's an uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you always sort of joke, like,
you know, you started a hundred percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of thing and every little
mistake, you know, you go down from a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred to 98 to 94 to whatever,
and you never get to go back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, how few mistakes can you
make and how can you hit like all those
[SPEAKER_01]: apex turns that you're chasing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout this round.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, you know, how far forward
are you always planning, looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking, and it really starts with how
good are your clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I feel like that's a great way
to break it down for people, even for home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers too, where if you're looking at,
you know, the potential for your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to definitely start with a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if your clones aren't that
great, then you already need to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I'm not going to have the best
harvest I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you accept that, then you can still
work within the parameters that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let's say your genetics just
aren't that great or you don't have a veg
[SPEAKER_00]: space that's able to be dialed in well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always, you know, through some
environmental parameter, having some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrient deficiency or other health
issue with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what you get to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like a lot of times when people
are trying to optimize their space,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they, they miss that point where
it's, you have to work with what you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes what you have isn't ideal
and you can still do really well with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing how to then kind of pivot
around those issues is something that does
[SPEAKER_00]: take a lot of time and practice and
patience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like to your point here,
like, yeah, sorry, I guess this is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: two part answer to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my like teacher days, you know,
like, you know, there was something at the
[SPEAKER_01]: one school I was teaching at, you know,
they would call it like two kisses and a
[SPEAKER_01]: wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like this is like my biggest
takeaway from being a teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after you'd sort of finished
these projects or assignments,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the whole class would go around
and like, you know, every student would
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, one student would sort of
essentially not be in the center of the
[SPEAKER_01]: circle, but like their work would be on,
on, on center stage and the whole class
[SPEAKER_01]: would go around and sort of, you know,
give them two kisses and a wish,
[SPEAKER_01]: like two things that they did well and one
thing that they could improve on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like that was like one of the
biggest takeaways for me because it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to sort of accept criticism in that
way from peers at times, or, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the garden, you really need to
like as far forward planning as you can
[SPEAKER_01]: be, you know, to put out fires three
months down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to dwell on mistakes
and stuff from the past, but you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect those dots and reflect back to
really understand where that hiccup came
[SPEAKER_01]: from and how I can, you know, like,
okay, that happened this time because of,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say your environmental conditions
or, you know, you don't have the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so how do I now connect that dot
backwards to plan forwards that it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: going to kind of come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, like reflection is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't dwell on stuff and let it bring
you too far down when you like have these
[SPEAKER_01]: hiccups or mistakes, but you do need to
reflect and sort of how do I improve and
[SPEAKER_01]: connect those dots to them that you're
planning going forward, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: is improved and more optimal than it was
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, looking back at where those
hiccups may have started is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzler's dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like to puzzle and if you like to
do anything sort of like mentally,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a mental gymnastic sort of practice
or a mental exercise, then by looking back
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to puzzle this together and
figure out where you had an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be able to learn so much
more than just by trying to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from ever happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by having, you know, it's a,
it's a great trait in the garden to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to problem solve, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because problems arise all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing with living plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bugs, there's pathogens,
there's environmental conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's electrical failures, there's other
equipment failures, all of this can go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than freaking out and saying
that piece, you know, that one little
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of the puzzle fell away.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I, I can't do anything about it
because I needed that piece to finish the
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to say, well, this is kind of
going back to what we've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now operating at 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to bring everything down to
match that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you're going to hurt the plants
by, you know, oh, so you're, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the room cooled down far enough when
you're putting that much wattage in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't run your lights at a hundred
percent anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you got to make sure that you're
cycling your de-hues properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not dumping all that extra BTU
into the room as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these different things that
you can then sort of dial those down to
[SPEAKER_00]: match your new baseline because of
something that isn't working properly or
[SPEAKER_00]: because you just don't have the ability to
have it work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's with so much of like
gardening and general, you have to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to pivot on the spot and be able to adapt
to what changes in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now too, these days with all the
data, like every sensor in the world that
[SPEAKER_01]: we run and all of this data, you know,
it's kind of like, you know, I guess in
[SPEAKER_01]: the old days, like, you know, I used to
have like the big desktop calendars
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, you know, and you would,
you know, you know, back, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you click your little thermometer for
high and low and for temperature humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was my pH, this was the EC,
like, you know, you would write all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those inputs in daily for everything you
did, you know, and then like, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, mine too would have like what
concerts I was going to or what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so like it really told the story
and, you know, that round kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could look back and you're like,
oh, well, you went on tour for a week or
[SPEAKER_01]: two, you know, like, you know,
so you can see like the fluctuations of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things that connect those dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we have sensors and stuff like
that and alerts on your phone or your
computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like, kind of like,
turn it into the, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: muscle memory, but like, you know,
like we're saying like this reactionary,
[SPEAKER_01]: my DHEs can't handle this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, what are you going to do to
now sort of make it so your DHE can,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, whether it's adjusting temperature
and raising your temps or trying to spread
[SPEAKER_01]: the irrigation out in a certain way or
less plant, you know, again, what good
[SPEAKER_01]: decision, you know, what good decisions
can I make for what's in front of me in
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of thing, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just sort of have to like,
just be comfortable to like, call that
[SPEAKER_01]: audible, but you still have to follow the
plan, you know, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole point is to have a plan that
works kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, but again, one of my buddies
is another consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, anybody could buy SRPs
and they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes like people like us
are real important when it becomes like
[SPEAKER_01]: those emergency procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that's what you sort of are
buying is us to help you solve on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, it's one of my
favorite parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like how creative, as creative
as you can be to solve is sort of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like love that creative problem
solving.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a chef for like 10 years and part
of, you know, being a chef is problem
[SPEAKER_00]: solving because you have to make sure that
your budget works or your menu has this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But server didn't ring this in and you
need it on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, like that's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to pivot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it helps a lot in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, add another pan or cook
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, like, I don't know,
that shows how good you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all this normal stuff in front of
me, but now I have to add this and this
[SPEAKER_01]: and this and do it as fast as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's cool to show how much in
control are you that you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the biggest lessons that you
learn is redundancy because you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to, you know, if something fails,
you need to be able to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: execute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I have a little foster puppy over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not little.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like you said, the redundancy,
man, like, it's one of those things that
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, all your me's and paws in
a row, like, you know, like be prepared,
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and then when stuff does go a little
sideways, like hang, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hang in there with it and solve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Phil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, UPS guys out front.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think we've had a great
little intro into what you do with Next
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Crop and sort of the, your,
the I Party with Jared collection and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you're doing there in your
sort of professional life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, correct me if I'm wrong,
but it sounds like your partnership with
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Big Crop is kind of leading up a lot
of the cultivation aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the, of the, the group that you're with
because of your experience with growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and cultivating and, you know,
helping other growers out when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: working at the gardening store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that pretty accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, myself, like, you know,
like you sort of joked about earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: like nobody's ever going to buy a computer
from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christian, my one partner comes from like
the finance world kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if like Excel spreadsheets where,
you know, you could compare Pete and them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he would do really well kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's a numbers and organized as can
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like extremely good at like the
project management aspect and keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody accountable and in row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if this gets backed up,
you know, we didn't order these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever, you know, air
conditioning unit, or we didn't order this
[SPEAKER_01]: at time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that moves everything back on like the,
you know, the project management and the
[SPEAKER_01]: build out charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everything's moved back three
weeks now because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Christian does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I couldn't do what he does
when it comes to sort of that project
[SPEAKER_01]: management and like financial stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my other partner, Rich, he actually
founded next big crop in like 2012 or 14
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, what feels like forever ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sort of has a construction and
landscape and background, and he built one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the first greenhouses in Boulder as
like a construction worker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next thing he knew he was running
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sort of has a construction and
cultivation background as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ran a bunch of spots as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when he started doing the
application writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of where next big crop
came from as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I couldn't do what either of
them do for sure kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also dare them to try and come
play with plants and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of one of those things like,
you know, it's sort of at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: like all these projects are just honestly
like too big for any one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no unicorn out there that can
do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of to like have that complimentary
team where everybody's sort of a subject
[SPEAKER_01]: matter expert in their lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all wear lots of hats, you know,
and solve and whatever, but like to sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of have that comfort spot of like,
you know, where you hang out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is your world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to own it and you got to be just
on all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of next big crop, like I said,
we have lots of clients, pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: almost every state that, you know,
legal markets working in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: design facilities, sort of sold gear,
sold genetics to help with applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or operational plans or financial models
and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like sort of the network we've
built, you know, between vendors and
[SPEAKER_01]: clients is like something to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of like, you can walk into any
room with your head high, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have any right kind of thing over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, considering your vast
background in dealing with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, I do like to find out sort of where
you started your journey with plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, whether that be when you
were younger, growing up, if there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden in the backyard or, you know,
some people say that cannabis is the
[SPEAKER_00]: gateway plant to gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's the other way around
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did your journey with plants
begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my mother is like as talented of as an
artist as like you can be kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she ran, she was an art teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when she was younger,
she ran a clothing company and sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: designed clothes and all kinds of stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sort of quilting, like drawing,
painting, all of that photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess she always had like a
vegetable garden at her house growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so she literally would walk
across a creek to the other side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: field to garden, you know, pick all
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was dinner for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she just ate salads constantly,
you know, and I'll send you some pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, you know, like they just moved to
Asheville, North Carolina a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Philly my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she has a couple of bird of paradises
that are probably like, I think one is
[SPEAKER_01]: like 43 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is 30 something.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a few other plants that are 50
plus years old that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's been carrying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at this point, she has to hide stuff
from my dad when she brings her new plants
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's probably got 500 plus like
cacti, cactuses, succulents, cacti,
[SPEAKER_01]: succulents, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll send you pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, pretty stunning work kind of
like, like, how do you know the Latin
[SPEAKER_01]: names for all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I didn't really realize it,
you know, like how, you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: younger, you don't realize certain things
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like they said she had plants there,
you know, the house I grew up in,
[SPEAKER_01]: like one of the rooms, big glass windows,
two stories tall without a second floor
[SPEAKER_01]: above it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she had a 20 some foot tall plants my
whole life kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew up around plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't really, I guess, to be
honest, I used to mow lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from the time I was like,
I don't know, maybe 11, I was mowing lawns
[SPEAKER_01]: to make money to buy dirt bikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, didn't really realize it,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, back when I was a kid,
I could tell you all kinds of stuff about
[SPEAKER_01]: sky, whatever, insert whatever lawn,
you know, we had Kubota tractors,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, kind of so like,
whatever, just didn't really maybe realize
[SPEAKER_01]: it so older that maybe that's where it all
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like I said, when I got this
job, and I guess sort of always sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: self-medicated my whole life, pretty
regularly kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then like, you know, I started
bartending at that one bar, and they sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of drug me up the hill to get a trim for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then you're like,
I want my own plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in this little carriage house,
you know, tiny little carriage house,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was teaching whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I literally moved my mattress to the
staircase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like up against the staircase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hung a tarp and I hung 2000
watts on one side and then had a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom with some just T5s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I moved all my clothes down into my
living room and kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I literally slept on a mattress next
to 2000 watts and did that for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, until I got robbed, you know,
and then that's like a whole new learning
[SPEAKER_01]: experience kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got robbed and sort of freaked
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, ah, you know, sort of one of
the cues, like the one sort of sensei
[SPEAKER_01]: master mentor that is, you know,
we could talk about him, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, he's a sensei.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is so far ahead of his time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was part of a project up in Netherlands
that he wanted out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was kind of just like, why don't
you, you know, he told the guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, his partners, why don't you
bring Curly up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they used to just call me
Curly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I started going up the hill
and like Sarah said, like, I never really
[SPEAKER_01]: grew any plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, I went from two lights,
you know, with my mattress next to that
[SPEAKER_01]: tarp here in those white shoe boxes home
all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: To 10 to 14 to three houses, you know,
next thing you know, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as sort of many houses, you know,
and I guess like I was finishing my
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it was, you know,
the first time I went through college was
[SPEAKER_01]: like BNC student.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bartended and partied and had a real
good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was getting my teaching degree
and started, you know, growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a 4.0, you know, like all of a
sudden it was like the first time you ever
[SPEAKER_01]: had it, you know, with those big desktop
calendars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time I ever had a
schedule, but I guess I followed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so like all of a sudden,
you know, school clicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a 4.0, graduated with whatever high
honors from, you know, like that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, you know, kind of just,
you know, I think like a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: it almost gets addictive kind of thing to
have these gardens and trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: something so pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just it's like a very
creative outlet, you know, where you get
[SPEAKER_01]: to take something for being like,
you know, a small little plant to this
[SPEAKER_01]: final finished flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like probably like lots
of other people, you know, in our world,
[SPEAKER_01]: great at starting stuff and not finishing
some stuff and projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was like the first thing that
ever clicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first thing that ever clicked
that like I followed through and in that
[SPEAKER_01]: way and like finished hard and,
you know, just got super proud of your
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, that's now 17 years
later, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that first grow set up though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so you said you had just like a tarp
kind of separating the room out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what was like your inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you feeding these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a successful first grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call it medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of like there was like a
little carriage house with like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you sort of sloped roof and a
little tiny staircase that went upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a tiny little bathroom with like
a sliding curtain kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a mattress up against the stairs
and I used to have to fill up five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets, you know, in the shower and like
walk across my mattress to get to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, literally it was like, you know,
and there was like a little fireplace or
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a chimney in the middle of this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a hammer and, you know,
beat a hole in that chimney to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: exhaust everything out of, you know,
sort of tarps down on floors and hung.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, I guess at that point
we were using like the Dutch bleach trays,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there were, you know, six inch brodan
slabs, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in the beginning, yeah,
it was on ionic, which I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian, but ionic was a one part,
you know, recipe, you know, you'd veg near
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom and like a little PK booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just basically had little
recirculating pumps, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with those bleach trays and the slabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I slept next to these
plants with, you know, the lights going at
[SPEAKER_01]: night and, you know, the upstairs and a
little tiny carriage house with no
[SPEAKER_01]: insulation in the middle of the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you doing like ebb and flow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you doing like an ebb and flow
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had like a little, like your cement
mixing bins, you get a Home Depot or
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowe's kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were 11 gallons a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like a little pump with some drip
stakes, you know, drip line going up to
[SPEAKER_01]: each slab kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, I guess, because these guys,
you know, used to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: big houses up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be two plants a light just to keep
the counts under 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so I just basically mimic
that my house kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so you do, you did four plants under
2000 Watts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was, you know, and again,
the guys I was getting genetics from,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Chuck and John and them, like,
it was as good, like, we'll get into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I could have that cut of sour
diesel back, you know, from back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do anything for, you know,
it is the best sort of cut that I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: touched that I've lost, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what specific cut of sour
diesel it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is coming back like the 14 to
17 year mark here in Denver kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, you know, they just always
just referred to it as the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and they're from the south of
big old beards and yeah, big dudes like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, and the day, you know, like kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I knew what cut, you know,
it has been long gone kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have been searching ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to connect you with one of the,
well, with my co-founder with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Craft Growers Network, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my eyes all over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to get to meet him and go
mess with that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because he's got a few different
sour cuts that, well, one of them might be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think a few of them are like 18,
19 years old.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His list is impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't wait to trade, collaborate,
do whatever kind of thing with him to get
[SPEAKER_01]: my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys also used to have this
Hawaiian that was like, just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, I would only smoke that like
during like midterms or finals,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would only smoke the Hawaiian cause I
joke, you know, instead of smoking dope,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would smoke smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that Hawaiian, you know, kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I don't know, but yeah,
it's going back a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said like, it was ionic for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, that was sort of the
one team's recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Southern guys were all in GH
and was, you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a bunch of Southern boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know, shot,
we talked in shot glasses of green,
[SPEAKER_01]: purple, pink, you know, like your general
hydroponics, three part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, like those recipes were
written in certain ways from them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then I guess the good,
you know, they introduced me to the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: at chlorophyll here in town, which is no
longer around, but like Bowen Lee
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely like educated me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feel like super righteously,
like thankful that I sort of had like the
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers and mentors I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're kind of like as good as you,
you know, sort of came up on like teams
[SPEAKER_01]: where these guys really, you know,
and I guess even back then, like I started
[SPEAKER_01]: joking like, well, in the name of science
and like, you know, you would run,
[SPEAKER_01]: have trash cans, but you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the next setups after that one that
I love, we had built out a warehouse in
[SPEAKER_01]: Boulder and it was a 10,000 square foot
warehouse and it was all eight inch PVC
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe and they cut the tops out of it and I
had little handles like kind of thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'd be like 40 foot runs to mimic
the Dutch leech trains kind of thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: eight inch PVC on just saw horses and like
big horse troughs as reservoirs at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like three of us could run this 10,000
square foot warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so basic and simple like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then like after that one got broken
down, I stole a bunch of that eight inch
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe from my house kind of thing,
but I would even run like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact same strains, you know,
he had 4,000 Watts in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd like, you know, two, two eight
inch pipes on one side, two eight PVC
[SPEAKER_01]: pipes on the other side with different
reservoirs, but the exact same genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: but different nutrients and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even back to some side by sides and
stuff to see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like, I love cars and motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like, you know, sort of,
I don't always look at it as like,
[SPEAKER_01]: race car shit, you know, like this versus
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, you were writing down
the recipes and all this stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just like, you know,
you sort of competing with yourself to
[SPEAKER_01]: just see where you should take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were running those eight inch
pipes where you still using like a drip
[SPEAKER_00]: system and just letting that be sort of
your trough to drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you know, you put your little
culver like half inch or three quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: inch, like sort of PVC down it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it holds your slabs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like off the ground kind of
thing and just put the slabs right all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, if you could imagine
big warehouses full, just saw horses and
[SPEAKER_01]: eight inch PVC, like so simple,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like, I don't know,
like the simplicity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like race car stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's like, and I love like sleeper
cars, like, you know, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise anything, but you want to be
real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always look at like, you know,
the same kind of thing as like eight inch
PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was designed to hold water and move
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we were doing in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you sort of cut it,
design it, make it work in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like, I don't know,
it was so simple, but yet it worked so
[SPEAKER_01]: well kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes the best systems are
those that are the simplest to use because
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to, there's no guesswork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if anything fails, it's as simple
as, you know, busting out the saws all and
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting the pipe off and throwing in a new
piece, you know, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all form and function, nothing to
look cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just, you know, it is truly like
performance designed kind of mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't get me wrong, like we get
bored over the years and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do organic, I'm going to
switch to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like I've done it,
you know, it's a way to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you work there at the
store, you know, you put your,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, eight or 10 hour shifts in and
you just read every bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shelf kind of thing and like make
up fantasy recipes, or you get to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially watch all your customers
buying all this stuff and who does really
[SPEAKER_01]: good work and cherry pick these ideas from
them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, I've run like every
nutrient, you know, you could imagine all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different substrates, the different
size containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, like, like I said,
in the name of science, it was just like
[SPEAKER_01]: fun to like practice and put it all
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's do like a little, uh,
fun mental exercise then since you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this experience with all the different
nutrients and all these different setups,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were to help a home grower set up a
four by four tent, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With, um, and let's talk hydroponics
because organics and stuff is more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: religion to a lot of the people that grow
that way rather than a practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I feel like if that's the route
of growing that someone wants to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wholeheartedly support it, but it's
really hard to, um, to say that this is,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from, from someone who sold the
different inputs and the different aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing, it's hard to be like,
this is exactly what you need to do to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with hydroponics in a lot of cases,
there's, you know, there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: recipes, there's different, um,
there's different forms and functions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different hydroponic systems that you
can use that kind of required either a
[SPEAKER_00]: tweak here or a change there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to help someone set up a
four by four tent, what nutrients are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What style of hydroponics are you helping
them set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some of the things that you
think you might be able to help alleviate
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the struggles of hydroponics,
whether it be like runoff capture or
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient delivering or, um, tank mixing or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of run through, uh, if you had
to design your own four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tent at home right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess what, so we'll sort of start,
you know, kind of obviously LED light at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point, just because, you know,
temperature control, electricity,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all of this stuff kind of thing
for, you know, that's such a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like love Fluence lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've loved Gavita lights, ran DLI lights
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those are my top three kind of
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like any of those, you know, you have like
as good a fixture as you could get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know, I guess starting to mess
with some BIOS lights as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't run them yet, but like about
start playing with their under canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, get your sort of your
standard bar style LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess when it comes to nutrients,
I feel like it's a pretty no brainer for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want team Kana, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, there's an A and a B kind of
thing to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always equal parts of A and B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you could kind of do it with
your eyes closed or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the answer is more or less,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both go up and down at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at your plants and you're
like, you know, color or this or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the answer is more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, um, and they have an AB veg and
an AB flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also for their cocoa line,
you know, the cocoa specific nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: line, it's the same for veg and flour kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a home grower, you literally could
get your cocoa A and your cocoa B and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the same nutrients for veg and flour,
which would be super convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like I love, like I said,
I'm not, I kind of love these compressed
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, blocks at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're so just consistent and easy
and no mess and no pots to wash at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, you get all of like,
you know, the commercial part,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, is there a virus in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you didn't wash your pot good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you just spread it to your next
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these compressed cocoa blocks sort of
eliminate all of that and the labor and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, the four by four 10,
like, I guess I always like to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that is like pattern on a dice,
you know, when it comes to your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: arrangement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could do four, you could do
five, you could do nine, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the pattern on the dice kind of
is like how we'll set those plants up to
[SPEAKER_01]: you sort of have just like that sort of
even space management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that all of our plants, ideally you
could take any one plant and put it to
[SPEAKER_01]: another spot and they're all the same
shape and you could switch them and nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: would ever know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that sort of shows your control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like four plants, five plants or nine
plants in that, I guess you could do eight
[SPEAKER_01]: too, but, um, you know, in that four by
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've, again, I canna cocoa that
they're like cocoa flex pots now and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have like a one gallon and a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the smaller ones, but I would stay
in that one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I would build myself, you know,
outside your tent, you know, get yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: like that 55 gallon drum or 20 gallon
trash can, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and sort of the correct pump,
you know, you gotta do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: math when it comes to pumps, um,
just to make sure the pressure is right,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, just get your pressure
compensating, like not a fin drippers so
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, every plant's getting the
exact same amount of feed or like can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the other thing is like,
um, I picked, you know, it's been this way
[SPEAKER_01]: for years and years too, but like,
you know, uh, there's certain bottles that
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to love that I don't use anymore
just for like cleanliness purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sort of like a synthetic liquid
nutrient, like canna cocoa, the reservoir
[SPEAKER_01]: is always clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drip lines are always clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, so like you always sort
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about that certain
maintenance kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, A and B, you know,
you have your PK booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could run a little hypochlorous acid
or whatever, you know, but you really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, you know, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago, I used to have 15 part recipes
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure, you know, but now it's kind of
like, yo, AB, maybe some cow mag,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on where you live and well
water, city water, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: RO stuff, but like the hardest thing I
think to teach somebody, especially for a
[SPEAKER_01]: home grower, um, what is wet and what is
dry if you don't have the sensors kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, you know, like, so as long as your
environment is in that sort of window of
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD, that it's going to be happy,
you know, kind of thing, like you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need too many parts of nutrients to really
put out stellar product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the answer is like, what is wet
and what is dry and kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, again, just keep it between the
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just, but like, yeah,
so I go like, you know, pick your led
[SPEAKER_01]: light, some canna cocoa, nutrients of the
same veg and flour newts in a one gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: pot with a drip, you know, and then you go
to Home Depot or Lowe's or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: and get your little six gallon waste
runoff, you know, kind of like cement
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing bin and that can catch your
wastewater and you could, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: go water your house plants or whatever
outside with that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you wanted to reuse it,
you certainly could, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would keep it simple like that,
you know, and then I'd also focus on make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you have genetics that you're stoked
and excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to give you the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end that you want, but like,
it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few questions then in your opinion,
seed or clone for a first grower clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I hopefully, I sure, you know,
hopefully, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a friend that can kind of coach you along
and help you out and they'll give you
[SPEAKER_01]: those first couple clones that they've
grown it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they could tell you the little bit,
the cheat sheet with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you kill it or mess it up, who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to give you a new one,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, get clones from a buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, you have a friend,
you got a mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to like coach you along.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are kind of, uh, always what I
would suggest to people when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting off, because you can look and see
where it's, what it's produced in other
[SPEAKER_00]: settings and have a goal that you can have
as your target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas seeds are just a lot more hit
and miss, no matter how good the breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things where there is no
uniformity in cannabis breeding right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can't plant a field of cannabis
seeds at this point and expect for there
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a, um, a true uniformity across that
entire crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're only popping a couple at
home.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you know, if you love it,
you're like, cool, let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I do it better this time?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what improvements am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you that ability to baseline
and continue to make good decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, uh, so like, I always
suggest for people that are starting off
[SPEAKER_00]: with hydroponics to just run a,
um, a single set of irrigations per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they always, where they reach field
capacity, achieve some runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then allow for a dry back over the,
the remainder of the day and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that in mind, um, is that
something that you would suggest for new
[SPEAKER_00]: growers as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you suggest something slightly
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's one of those things of like,
you know, there's no like one correct
[SPEAKER_01]: answer here, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, I would almost say
like, pick that philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to follow that methodology
from the start and follow it all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to get cute and play
with like your sort of irrigations and
[SPEAKER_01]: like push it that way, you start that way
from day one and you follow that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to push that one big,
uh, you know, sort of scheduled feed or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of as the plant needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're not going to water again
until the plant is ready to accept,
[SPEAKER_01]: follow that the whole way through,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say, I don't think there's a
right answer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, what do you, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to learn from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to stick with that the
whole way through to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: prove it to yourself, what you learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, again, yeah,
you know, we could get cute and start
[SPEAKER_01]: talking like, you know, kind of where do
you live?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Colorado's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, you know, so certain,
certain other factors might lead one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those decisions to being a better decision
than another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, I would just say,
you know, pick one and learn from that and
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the plan.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is key and a lot of aspects
and your plants, especially when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: on drip irrigation, they're going to,
if they're getting consistent irrigations
[SPEAKER_00]: daily or at a specific, um, uh,
volumetric water content, let's say like
[SPEAKER_00]: where it, it drives back to a specific
number and then boom, it triggers an
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as long as you, you're triggering it
consistently at whatever set point that
[SPEAKER_00]: is, the plants are going to tend to
respond positively to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so yeah, I, I suggest doing the,
the, the one set of irrigations event of
[SPEAKER_00]: events per day and doing that all the way
through, because then they'll see this
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely generative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the morphology of the plant
tends to be very desirable in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people can start to mess with how
they want to manipulate their yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, or, you know, if it's at a
specific dry back point, making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you just hit it with the irrigation,
then all those things I think work really
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what, what EC and what pH would you
suggest for people if they're running the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the Kana nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably just always stay safe and
just be like six point, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus or minus whatever, but like,
yeah, your six is just like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out right there in the middle kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I guess honestly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: P sorry, six pointer piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when it comes to like sort of EC
at this point, you know, what we used to
[SPEAKER_01]: do five years ago, 10 years ago,
15 years ago, you know, kind of thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: very different than sort of, um,
what people are currently doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, again, all the sort of
different nutrient manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, you know, Kana,
Athena, Front Row, GH, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like all of them have their
recommendations kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but again, I think it's going to
go back a little bit to like how many
[SPEAKER_01]: Watts is your light?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you have a power meter and
what's, you know, what is your reading at
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of some of these other factors are
going to swing that, but just to play it
[SPEAKER_01]: safe and sort of straddle a fence,
like you can probably hang out at like a
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.0 EC the whole time and be pretty
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not leaving something on the table
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you are pushing hard enough to get
that desired result.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, and again, like sort of
different nutrients, sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations and, um, you know,
every, all situations are different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but basically if you sat at a 6.0 pH and a
2.0 EC, you could probably go hang out and
[SPEAKER_01]: be super comfortable throughout a whole
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great answer,
especially for new growers and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're not providing any supplemental
CO2 and you know, within that same line of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, keeping all the other
environmental and lighting factors at an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable level rather than trying to
push them to the nth degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because at that point there are going
to be different nutrient packages that
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be increased in order to make sure
that the metabolism of the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: operating at its full potential with the
photosynthetic potential of the light that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're providing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of those factors, you know,
it's like, uh, the, the Liebig's law,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have your limiting factors
within like the staves of a, of a barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, as long as you're raising them all
up together and going little bits at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time on all of them to make sure that
nothing spills over, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve a pretty optimal result for your
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that that was fun,
uh, to tell people a little bit about how
[SPEAKER_00]: they would might, uh, how someone with
your experience might set up a new home
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, one of the random other
things if possible, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this little home grow, if you could
set yourself up, like, this is one thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like I've pushed on a couple of
friends over the, like, if you can set
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself up a four by eight tent,
but really only have one light in it so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can contain everything inside
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, you don't have to worry
about stuff spilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could fit, if you had to fit
a little portable air conditioner or
[SPEAKER_01]: humidifiers or whatever kind of other
factors, you know, if you had the space to
[SPEAKER_01]: put a four by eight tent, but truly only
put one light in it, but put all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: other environmental controls in there,
like that's the styley way to like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a killer work in a small space like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, um, the, the step up from a
lung room, but right before you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: meet a fully, uh, sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, you know, you can still do
passive intake or exhaust or even active
[SPEAKER_00]: intake or exhaust and something like that
if you need to, because like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have maybe an AC inside the
tent, but you need to exhaust the AC still
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like a standing one or,
you know, you cut a hole in it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: stick it up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Against a wall where you already have a
wall mounted AC or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're still having some sort of air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I've seen all sorts of
different styles of that, but I do really
[SPEAKER_00]: like the idea of having a four by eight or
a five by 10 with just one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of room to work around your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even center that light in the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have an extra like three feet and
two feet on either side, and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: to all different sides of your plant
really easy that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a great way to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also containing smell,
containing spillage of water, sort of all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus like while you're working in there,
you could watch this humidifier kick on,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you hear an exhaust, you know,
kind of, it's like, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it turns the same thing that we
do in these big, big buildings now just to
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller scale kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get to like see how this turns on,
this turns off, you know, like just all
[SPEAKER_01]: the moving parts, pulling levers and how
it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's a, a great advice for
new growers, especially if they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to, and the space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's, you know, a little bit of
overhead costs that you gotta can deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the space of a four by eight tent
is significant if you're in like a small
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these different factors need to be
taken into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if for an ideal,
you know, one light set up, that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people I think would be able
to hit the ground running and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on their first, however many
harvests that they get out of something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, if they're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could do quite a bit of work out
of that little space, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not really, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably, if you're doing
everything correctly, you're, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: easily pulling 12 to 15 pounds out of that
space per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's just for your own
consumption at home and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through more than a pound a month,
then you might need to slow down a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be impressed, but yeah, whatever,
you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of, we've touched base on your
background, what you do at Next Big Crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the current
things and current projects that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe some of the things that you've
seen within the cannabis industry that you
[SPEAKER_00]: either might want to see change or see
move in a certain direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are some of the trends that
you're seeing and things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: currently experiencing through your
consultation services?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess like one of the, you know,
like I said, we kind of have projects
[SPEAKER_01]: every, you know, lots of markets kind of
thing, even at this point, like
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like something shiny,
you know, and fun to talk about and dream
[SPEAKER_01]: about and stuff like that, you know,
hoping it gets closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on one project in Costa
Rica for almost three years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's real close to getting across the
finish line and can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess sort of like sort of certain
things to see in the market these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I guess like the hardest
thing as a consultant sometimes is to like
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and sort of try to prove to,
you know, like the team that you're coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in to work with, you're like, yo dude,
I don't want your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I am not here for your job kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm here to help you solve stuff and
sort of get in and get out kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it is a, it's a dance and like
trying to figure, you know, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: become friends with the cultivation team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to sort of put your time in the
trenches a little bit and show that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yo, I've done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to work right alongside with you
to help solve this, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I win when you solve problems and get
better kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, that's like, you know,
one of the biggest and like most immediate
[SPEAKER_01]: obstacles, like everywhere you go,
you know, sort of like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sort of probably maybe upset
some people was like saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's just like certain things that
are just unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when it comes to like sales teams and
accounting stuff and whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: spreadsheets, you're like, you know,
bro, like your spreadsheet's not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, so sort of, again,
bringing those expectations back to
[SPEAKER_01]: reality and then, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, people want something
that tests this high that finishes this
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and like, it sort of just
puts like unrealistic goals or like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: In front of everybody, which then causes
like teams to clash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the garden's like, I need more
time or I need more money or I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's sort of like, it's sort of
hard to, you know, and then certain people
[SPEAKER_01]: have like certain egos that are like,
you know, sort of hard to work around kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, and again, like lots of
it's opinion based, like this flower's
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I wish there was a little bit
more I don't know, I guess, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, I feel very lucky to have sort of
become friends with the people like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: friends with and the network and all that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, your people really
take care of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I like to think I take
care of them, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like protecting yourself by
like building this killer team around you,
[SPEAKER_01]: vendors, friends, clients, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I don't know, I guess I wish
people would treat you, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish people would treat you the way you
treat them kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of thing, which is like,
I guess it's, you know, in the old days,
[SPEAKER_01]: like etiquette was everything,
you know, people sort of stepped out of
[SPEAKER_01]: line, like, you know, people got
blacklisted or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked off the, you know, kind of thing
differently than now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it always seems like a bunch of
what you're saying boils down to
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where as producers, you need to educate
the, your marketing team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to educate the buyers and the
buyers need to educate the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that needs to be, there needs to be
some continuity there in education so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you aren't facing people that have,
like as a, as a consultant, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going into a situation where you're facing
these undesirable expectations,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's not necessarily unrealistic in
certain aspects, but it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not feasible within what they have
available to them to work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that keeps coming up in
this conversation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how often it is that you see people
expecting something that they can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't execute on, or they don't have
the team or the resources to execute on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then working with that expectation as
though it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, watching the sort of bricks
crumble around those expectations as it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't come to fruition and the
frustration and the anger and the blaming
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ego clashing and all these
different things that come up from just
[SPEAKER_00]: miscommunication or an uneducated person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not necessarily, I'm, I'm using
uneducated simply because like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of this community and this,
and the culture around cannabis that I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like when you're growing the plant,
you have this connection to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're consuming the plant,
you have this connection to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in between is kind of not,
it's not necessary in a lot of aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when there's whole industries built
around that unnecessary part, you lose a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to this capitalistic suckhole,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's, it's unfortunate because it's
how we are able to get the product to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers because of all the different
regulations and you know, the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: logistics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is this huge disconnect then
between what people are saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this in my joint versus what the
growers going like, I can't grow a 14 week
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa and get it to you and a $10 joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one in their right mind is going to
grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the sales team is saying we
need sativas, I need, I need a 14 week
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people are asking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that conversation three times in
the last two weeks kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate, but like, it's almost
hilarious how uneducated it is because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something as simple as the disconnect
of you're saying you want a 14 weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, you're doubling our input cost and
our overhead to produce that single gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just talk about it as a gram,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me how we're going to do that and
tell me how it's going to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability because you're getting
enough for it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Oh, it's, it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there and I've, you know,
we've probably done it like, we've done
[SPEAKER_01]: like grower events, you know, you go to
the dispensary so you could, customers can
[SPEAKER_01]: come ask you questions, you know,
and you sort of put out like blogs and
[SPEAKER_01]: newsletters and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and again, it's, I just feel
like it's one of those things of,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm, we're not the only ones to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously like everybody talks about like
sort of consumer education plans and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just one of the harder parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, sometimes deal with like,
yeah, sort of, I don't know, like was that
[SPEAKER_01]: a grow the other day and like,
you know, sort of they had their wish
[SPEAKER_01]: lists and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts and like, you know, we're trying
to push stuff on you and you're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, like bro, I've had bigger bedrooms
than your whole facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you've never worked in a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what you're telling me we need to do
or asking us to try to help you do is just
[SPEAKER_01]: not real kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, like I said, I've had bigger
bedrooms than the whole facility kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like the stubbornness or
whatever, you know, kind of thing to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to like achieve these.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, goals at the end is really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like the other thing,
again, like I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were, we mentioned earlier,
some of these smaller, more craft grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love, love those craft licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I could have my own, that's what I
would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it's absolutely,
you know, cause then it's like authentic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's owner operated, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of these facilities get in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is a part of people don't want
to talk about, but you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much of these big big facility staffs
don't really make the company money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there to fulfill roles because
they're such a big company and it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those salaries drain, you know,
kind of, and make it really difficult for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to be profitable, which then lead to
cut in all the corners and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, like, I don't know, I just give
me an opportunity for like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those craft size facilities where it's a
team of, you know, four or 10 maybe fit
[SPEAKER_01]: without, you know, put those small crews
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like some of the best product I've
seen here in Colorado, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from like smaller grows, you know,
their stuff's pre-sold at six dollars a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like two growers and two trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys about seven, you know,
but they've all been, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven guys in this facility, but they've
been together for four or five years and
[SPEAKER_01]: their work is killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'd be excited to go buy it,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's letting the flow guys in Boulder,
you know, kind of thing, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but like that's what a team,
you know, they pay their guys well,
[SPEAKER_01]: their team is super loyal to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go perform and execute in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like their product is killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that's the successful like
facilities and teams, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to have a happy staff in
order to have a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, so many people are just
trying to go for like uneducated and
[SPEAKER_00]: unskilled labor and then just trying to
like bring them up in a certain way,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there's so many opportunities
there for there to be a mist transfer of
[SPEAKER_00]: information where you can't then apply
that knowledge elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're like training them to do the
specific task.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you ask them to try and then
apply that knowledge in a different way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't always work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tough because it is an
agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't see the price ever going
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people for a while there were
saying, oh, we're waiting for the market
[SPEAKER_00]: to rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a reason for the price to
continue to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like my only little pushback to
that is I do think that like people will
[SPEAKER_01]: be brand loyal to somebody that has some
of these smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll always be able to be profitable
with your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good enough to hit grams per square
foot kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that stuff down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're not printing money like the
old days kind of thing, but like it is
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pay your people right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the correct inputs that you want
without like skipping something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that's just kind of why
it's like that balance point of that sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of craft size garden is a very happy
medium for you to go hang out and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of more referring to this
constant race to the bottom that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like by racing to the bottom and by
showing that the value of the product can
[SPEAKER_00]: be reduced, you're not going to then trick
anybody by trying to raise the price of
[SPEAKER_00]: something at the same quality point and
saying this is worth more now when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were already paying, you know,
a lower price for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to those larger
facilities and those larger producers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are still producing quality at scale,
that's where I feel like it's a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: for the overarching market, because when
you do have small craft farms like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about that are able to achieve a
$1,600 price point per pound or even some
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are breaking it up into
eighths or quarter ounces or ounces even
[SPEAKER_00]: and selling those at a high price point so
that their overall pound price is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, significantly more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's there's only room for like
extremely small boutique and highly sought
[SPEAKER_00]: after with limited supply cannabis to be
able to achieve those high price points,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's never going to be for anything that's
mass produced, at least in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that's where I make that
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even working at like way to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, people would come in with
receipts from three other grow stores and
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, they said they would sell it to
me at the, you know, like, so like
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, you know, it's one of those
things I feel like across the board,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's getting beat up with that race
to the bottom idea, you know, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one of those things of like,
it just, it beats everybody up,
[SPEAKER_01]: like across the board and it's hard to
deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's certain things will
never come back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain things will be good because
they've earned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys with eight lights that are
still operating in the gray market that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the ones that are making a killing
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hats off to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I miss those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm envious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm envious, but I, I have other
obligations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, yeah, I'm not about to be
running mid night runs with, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 20 pounds in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that like,
you know, sometimes you joke about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're like, waited for all
these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, is my door getting kicked in
tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I getting robbed or arrested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I guess glad to sort of have
moved on from some of that, but I guess at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time, some of the romance and the
sparkle of that was a whole lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, aren't the greatest, like the
greatest novels are like tragedies I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, and so we don't want to
live that tragedy though anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, what's, um, what are some
of the successes that you've, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered when helping out a facility
that are a highlight for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, um, if you don't mind
sharing what might be a couple of,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a failure point in when trying to help
implement these different things at
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities where, um, through both the
success and the failure, you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: something tremendous from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we'll start with the failure
part kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, I feel like sometimes again,
it gives us back to like communication and
[SPEAKER_01]: education kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like Sarah said, like teaching
teacher, um, you know, if you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine the class behaves differently when
you have a substitute teacher than like
[SPEAKER_01]: the regular teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to some of this stuff,
um, if you're not tight with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation team that's on the ground
there, you know, like sometimes you fly in
[SPEAKER_01]: for a week and then you're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado for a week or do a different
site for that week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you sort of stagger back and
forth and you still have your sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation meetings and, uh, you know,
like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, when you're away,
if the staff isn't like backing you and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of performing to, um, you know,
what they were supposed to do that day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or even almost like a little
malicious and we're like, Oh, we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he's not here this week,
you know, then it really turns into a
[SPEAKER_01]: battle of like us versus them,
you know, and they have a whole staff on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all live there, you know,
and I'm just a guy getting on a plane,
[SPEAKER_01]: flying back and forth, you know,
that's coming to tattle on them or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, that's like the hardest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and some of them have really
hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, you get really close with
cultivation team, you know, kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then the owner doesn't want to pay for
something anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, kind of, it just turns
into a little bit of a battle of like us
[SPEAKER_01]: versus them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of just why at this point,
you know, uh, now that we're like private
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just like sort of myself,
rich and Christian versus like this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: big publicly traded company, it's easier
for us to like, sort of insert ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: in as being like an owner's rep and being
with them kind of thing versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sort of the bosses over here
trying to push revenue for whatever board
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York and stuff like that,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's like, you get to,
you know, one, sometimes I'll joke or
[SPEAKER_01]: complain, like, why do I care about your
garden more than you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, you know, like, that's a
tough conversation to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I feel like that's like that,
I would say failure part, but it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: the uglier part kind of thing,
you know, cause like as a consultant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's lots of, you know,
high fives hugs and party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when things are working,
but you know, if things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the hiccups, lots of finger
pointing kind of thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, so like, you know, when things
work, there's like almost like no praise,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, yeah, everybody expects it to be
that way, you know, and then stuff gets a
[SPEAKER_01]: little sideways and yeah, fireworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no one brings it up when it's
working, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one takes a lawnmower into the shop to
get it fixed because it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in because it's broken and it's
not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're the one in charge of the
fixes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're, you're the repairman for
their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're looking at you for all the
failure points, especially if any of it
[SPEAKER_00]: happens after you've already come on to
the team to help them execute on what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it though, like you're saying,
especially with larger teams, and if that
[SPEAKER_00]: team doesn't feel connected to this style
of growing and the direction that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being given, then you start to run into,
um, little clashes that might not even be,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like you might not even see it as what
it is that's, uh, generating this issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the outcome of that issue is still
then affecting the grow in one way or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's like, you need to get
on board or hop the fuck off because this
[SPEAKER_00]: train is going and, uh, we're here to make
sure that it's going to continue to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, yeah, when you give someone,
you know, something simple, like let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a IPM SOP and there's two people that
are actually, oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have people that are,
you say, this is what you do these days of
[SPEAKER_00]: the week, you do it every single week and
you do not fail to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come in and they say,
ah, I've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go in and you're like,
there's motherfucking Russet mites on
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were doing it, I wouldn't see these
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur and oil don't mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, you're like, you come in
and they're like, well, I sprayed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're like, I don't know what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, bro, that phototoxicity from
that, you know, application, every leaf in
[SPEAKER_01]: this room is burned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's nothing left on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say you sprayed Sufoil on Monday
and, and sulfur on Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder why it looks like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that, um, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess along those same lines though,
like the sort of the most like rewarding
[SPEAKER_01]: part, you know, like I've, I feel like
I've been asked this question a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: times and like the answers evolved a
little bit, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're working in a garden where like
everything's jamming, like all the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like music's bumping in every grow room
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that vibe is like intoxicating kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So contagious.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like there's that,
but like along the lines of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, so I'm not feeling my like greatest
success story, you know, home girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your first harvest at a new
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, does anybody have any
friends that can come in and help harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so the one girl, uh,
brought her boyfriend in like no job,
[SPEAKER_01]: no whatever, never touched a cannabis
plant before, you know, but on day one of
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting, like, you know, his hands are
moving faster than anybody else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like hired him on and then he was
working just in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the harvest and like the trim team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sort of moved him up to like the
sort of processing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then next thing you knew,
I brought him outside with me to run the
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, within a year he went from
being some, you know, one of the girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: boyfriends that came in for like temp work
to run in the whole facility, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was like, you know, kind of thing
where like, when you get to like sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, maybe when I run a teaching
background, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you find like the younger version of
yourself or just somebody super like in it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to like, sort of bring them
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's fucking rad, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this analogy might be distasteful,
but sometimes you need them to drink the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you need them to be like on board
with the process and not, um, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I read somewhere over here that
this might work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we should try?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, maybe in a couple of
years, when you have everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already here down and it's operating
properly, and then we can start to play
[SPEAKER_00]: and have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with that though, they're reading
on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing with that, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, yeah, you know, kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'll give you the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, when somebody does like go
to do homework after, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just worked eight or 10 hours or
however long in the fields, a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going home and reading about
cultivation methodologies to come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: ask me more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'll take you to lunch every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, so like when you find
those, you know, at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, the rewarding part is like,
when you find those, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can sort of build those
relationships and those teams and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see somebody's life change cause of
the plant and learn in the same way as you
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like, Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing that I like to,
Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I like to do with people
is, is, um, you know, if they have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: for something that they want to implement
in the grow, I'll say, listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to tell me why we do the things
that we are doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you can tell me why we're doing
those things, then I want you to tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: why we should implement this other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it works and if it makes sense and
you understand how it's going to interface
[SPEAKER_00]: with these other processes, then let's
give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, if it's something I didn't
think of, I never be the smartest person
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be there and try to be
like, I know everything and I am the all
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the things you're like,
sort of present the idea, discuss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are, you know, like, is it,
can we do this in a controlled way?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a controlled setting where we're going
to get to actually see a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is really fun and super rewarding
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I like one of my other
favorite parts of it, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, you know, you've done this
forever long and like lots of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have, you know, you can walk in
somewhere and you're like, it takes five
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes to put together that like low
hanging fruit list of ways that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: improve this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you're like, all right,
we're already done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just stepped this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever sort of, I guess,
grading scale that we are, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like I love the creative
problem solving part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then when like the light
bulbs go off with them and you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: get to see those improvements like
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's like, you know, at this point,
there's no secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically how controlled of like an
understanding do you have across like all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the aspects to balance it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like one of the things I've seen
someone that I've worked with do that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was just like, you get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to get it is when they
started to understand why the EC would
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to have them problem solve it by
giving them the idea of saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a salt solution in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep one in a cup, like a full cup,
and then keep one and a half a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much salt is going to be left when
that water evaporates and watch them
[SPEAKER_00]: problem solve that out and then go the
substrates, the cup, and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into it is the salt solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's coming out is when you're,
you're adding more water to that salt
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, but still maintaining the
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go through this like process with
them to try and have them just relate it
[SPEAKER_00]: to table salt in water and in a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it usually works pretty well to
get them to go, Oh my gosh, I see that if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm allowing it to dry back too much,
and I'm not pushing that extra salt off,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just going to keep building and I
don't want it to go too high, but you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want it to go a little high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to go, yep, just,
just keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep monitoring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you see some tremendous results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buddy right now who is,
he swapped over from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, uh, multi part, um, uh, semi
organic, semi synganic, uh, large pot
[SPEAKER_00]: system to where I'm like, just,
I want you to do one gallon cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to do drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to up your EC slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's, um, amazed by how fast the
plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, this is, it's fun to watch,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it like said, like give me can
of cocoa, flex pots, the one gallons,
[SPEAKER_01]: your cocoa A and B nutrient with a little
bit of a drip and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: put somebody on with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, yo, if you can do this,
then you can get it creative and do
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want later kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, it really is that simple to
knock it out of the park kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, explain it like you're talking to
a second grader.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if everybody can understand that
kind of level, then like that's true
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehension and we can move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, don't need to ever try to be too
smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, such a huge part of
education is, uh, the continual education
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people who are teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by teaching other people,
I feel like it's always been the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to hone my own knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a, of a subject, because if I can teach
it, then I have a better grasp on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can teach it to people across a
multitude of, um, learning preferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I can know it even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, that's why I love doing this
podcast and talking to all different
[SPEAKER_00]: people and, and, you know, honing my own
skill through these conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and with even trading stories though,
you know, this worked for me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I could, along those same lines,
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sometimes I really wish I had my,
my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my like show piece, masterpiece,
whatever, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, sometimes I certainly really
wish I had that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of, but other times, like I'm
talking to a different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: half dozen to a dozen different gardens
that, you know, you're sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: invested and involved in all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, if you're trying to sort of make
whatever one correction here and there and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever I'm waiting six days or 10 days
before I implement certain things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, versus waiting two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're able to like, with that process
of deduction and like hone in on whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're trying to achieve and,
uh, you know, sort of get to that result
[SPEAKER_01]: so much faster by having your hands in,
you know, so many friends gardens or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, I don't know,
again, simple control, like reflect on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, you know, one of the other
things I feel like, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: along the same lines we're talking about,
you know, when it comes to success and
[SPEAKER_01]: failure stuff, sometimes it's like fail
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this person doesn't fit this role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move on to the next deserving person or
like, yeah, this application of whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're trying to manipulate the
plant with like doesn't fit, like don't
[SPEAKER_01]: keep forcing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, yeah, it didn't work three times
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hope and it's going to work the fourth
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, isn't going to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the definition of insanity,
sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, just that idea is like fail
faster, you know, again, reflect and get
[SPEAKER_01]: back at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, and I feel like with both of
our, um, I feel like we, we both have sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of this, uh, passion and, and a focal
point of education and a lot of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, like me with the podcast,
you with what you're doing through your
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting services with next big crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in your past with, you know,
helping educate people and even learning
[SPEAKER_00]: from your interactions with people at the
grow shop and, and, um, at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of the grow world that
you've, uh, encountered through your
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like you'll be a great person to
ask this question too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I want to break it up into two
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is what, uh, advice would
you give to new growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that one piece of golden advice
you'd give to new growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want it to be for someone who is
home growing for their medicine as part
[SPEAKER_00]: one, and for someone who is trying to
enter the cannabis industry as part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part one, um, for a home grower for
like medicine and passion projects and
[SPEAKER_01]: just like the craft and like the love of
it, you know, like these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I guess if people like you with
these podcasts, you know, there are such
[SPEAKER_01]: an open book of information, um,
all the YouTube channels, all just the
[SPEAKER_01]: reading that is out there kind of things
like do your homework, um, and sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, again, you know,
also at this point, you probably have a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend somewhere, whether it's in your
stage or town or across the country
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere, um, that is like totally
invested in like, this is their life and
[SPEAKER_01]: like lifestyle and career.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sort of like pick, pick a team
essentially that you want to sort of join
[SPEAKER_01]: like a philosophy and methodology and sort
of like follow the, you know, do your
[SPEAKER_01]: research so that you like pick the correct
team kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then really follow that plan that
those people give you or that you like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, put together yourself kind of
thing until it's sort of a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: exhausted or like you're ready for the
next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and again, like you don't need
all the fanciest everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you don't need that much space,
but like you do need a plan kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like really do your homework and put
together a plan and then go execute it
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, don't shoot from the hip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I would say for the
homegrown, um, is the most research and
[SPEAKER_01]: just like make a plan and then follow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your next round is going to be
different than your first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like you sort of need to make
those mistakes, push it too hard
[SPEAKER_01]: underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, it got too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, like the only way to sort
of find that, uh, sort of happy medium
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is to push it too hard to go under,
you know, one of my buddies and I talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you're like, how long does it take
you to figure out a strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the answer is maybe four
runs, maybe five runs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: first one sort of shooting in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one, you probably push it too
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third one, you probably back it down
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth one, ideally, you know,
you're right in that butter zone and like
[SPEAKER_01]: really hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if not the fifth one, you should
totally be able to, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a homegrown should almost think
of it like that way kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it'll take you four rounds to
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be comfortable and happy with what you
did, you know, because you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn a whole lot in those first four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's, uh, that's
applicable to not only a specific genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but any sort of style of growing and then
any adjustment to that style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, once you start to learn
about the different aspects of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: more, you definitely have the ability to
make those adjustments on the fly as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as make more adjustments at once rather
than only tweak one or two things in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you're tracking what
those changes do to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think that that's great advice
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it falls in line with a lot of what
other people have said to that answer or
[SPEAKER_00]: to answer that question, which is
patience, you know, have patience with
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, have patience with the grow
style, trust the process that you put,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't work, that's where you
get to start to be your puzzler and you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to get to try and figure out why it
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make an adjustment from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things just, yeah, I guess it's
the other one too, but like, I think one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I realized, you know,
through gardening, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I was ever very patient
before of a person, but like three garden
[SPEAKER_01]: and you realize it, like, you can't fake
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it takes two-ish weeks to clone a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, like, like, you know,
you can't fake time kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also can't fake how much time you
invest into your project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, the guy that the person
that puts in 20 minutes a day versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: person that's putting an hour in a day or
whatever, you know, but you can't fake
[SPEAKER_01]: time kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the more you put in, the more you get
out and just like, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, even if that first harvest or
second harvest isn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these big nugs, like you're seeing all
where, you know, like kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like, you really can't fake that
time that you invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long second line for somebody
wanting in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, man, I feel like this is a loaded one
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, I guess we don't, not going to say
that, but maybe, you know, kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really have to want it is maybe the
first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have them want this to be your
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: A career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is a lifestyle that,
uh, you know, and again, I go back to some
[SPEAKER_01]: of my beginning to feel like very lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like started, you know, cultivating like,
so when it was still a little bit outlaw
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado, like, you know, they started
having medical cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going and getting my medical
card at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you meet the doctor
and you pay your tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, you walk out of the back of
the doctor's office into a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's somebody's grandma packing bowls
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, while he could wait and pay with
a credit card or debit card to get a gram
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, you know, and you're like,
what is, you know, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of say like, but again,
like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back, you're like, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you really have to want it to be
like, it is a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a commitment kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole lot of sacrifice that
goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, kind of thing, especially in
the cultivation side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want to work in the retail
side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want to be say, you know,
again, like, you know, you really got to
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and again, I would say at this point,
a lot of places are established enough
[SPEAKER_01]: where you could find out the reputation of
how a company treats their people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I would just make sure that you're
joining a team with values and sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you feel like it's like a
like-minded facility or group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause otherwise some of them are
pretty toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just not like a positive part of life
or what you should be doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the whole point of like cannabis and
self-medicating and like the plant and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that is to make people better,
happier, like things better, brighter,
[SPEAKER_01]: finer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so make sure you're joining the team
that like is their purpose kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if a place isn't that maybe you
got to pull a record faster than you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that you don't like tarnish,
you know, something that is so sparkly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, um, I have definitely bailed on,
um, different grows, not necessarily like
[SPEAKER_00]: just like cut cord and run, but I've,
I've had to exit different companies just
[SPEAKER_00]: for the simple fact that their values
while, uh, were, you know, purported to be
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing ended up being something
completely different or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you go into someplace thinking that
you're going to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you're hearing stuff
that you're like, I know that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been, this has already been
disproven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a multitude of other people say
that this is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why are they saying this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, on, on the worst end of
things, you run into people that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of coke, drinking a bunch of
booze, you know, smoking on the job and
[SPEAKER_00]: not paying attention to what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, like cleanliness, dude,
like people like this is similar to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say food production,
but like we've done all that food
[SPEAKER_01]: production stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done classes and what, you know,
like, like needs to be clean kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's one of the first things,
like sometimes you walk in places and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, Oh, wow, I could eat off this
floor and like, fuck, yeah, this is gonna,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you walking in and you're just like
disgusted from the, you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yo, I need to burn these clothes kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't walk in and immediately
say, wow, this place is clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, you know, that's one of my,
you know, kind of, I'd say, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and clean is sort of a spectrum,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like depending on each facility,
the, the level of cleaning cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be achieved is, is on a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to have, you know,
temper expectations, but then also,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, if, if the end goal is to create a
product that you are putting into your
[SPEAKER_00]: body, whether it be through smoke,
vapor, an edible, a consumable,
[SPEAKER_00]: a topical, anything like this,
like it's going into your body,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to go into a place where
you don't want your body to be in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best cannabis like ever grown,
it's probably been grown in some old
[SPEAKER_01]: basement somewhere or whatever,
you know, doesn't mean it's not clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't mean they don't follow the
plans, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, so it doesn't have to be this
spaceship.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be so cutting edge and
robots and you know, but like you walk in
[SPEAKER_01]: and tables are dirty or floors are dirty
or whatever, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the dirty floors thing is one of
the big ones that, uh, oh man,
[SPEAKER_00]: you walk in and there's just like muddy
footprints everywhere and you go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jared, this has been a wonderful
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is a great point for
us to start wrapping up and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: going into a couple of these last little
questions that I like to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, was there anything else, uh,
about next big crop or what you do or
[SPEAKER_00]: about, uh, cannabis cultivation in general
that you wanted to touch base on before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get into this, these last few wrap up
questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess maybe just, like I said,
going back, I've said that how many times
[SPEAKER_01]: now, but like sort of feel really lucky to
have gotten to sort of come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, in an ideal world,
like give me some Dersetrons like Wally
[SPEAKER_01]: and Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I remember the first time I
installed a Dersetron, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, yeah, I was running a spot out in
Maryland and came home to a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: dead plants in my basement kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, Chris, I think it's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he like whipped me up one and then
Wally helped book without, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it removes so
much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, that mental exercise
of filling a rez and whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so it's kind of like,
I don't know, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I love race cars and building
race cars and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like, look at this, like,
so, you know, you have like that part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, um, and then like,
there's like the other part about,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, we were just talking about being
clean, like Zach homie over at biosafe is
[SPEAKER_01]: a wizard again, you know, when it comes to
like the clean chemistry behind this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know, like, uh, I can keep
going on sort of about the certain groups
[SPEAKER_01]: of people, you know, like the Canada guys
I'm not real close with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fluent skies and the devita guy,
you know, so like make friends with people
[SPEAKER_01]: and like learn from the subject matter
experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I guess I've done a pretty
good job at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always take care of them for them,
taking care of Nick, educating you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like, I don't know, like sort of
have a network to solve, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: any garden in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we're one degree away from,
you know, solving any major problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next big crop is one degree away from,
like, I'm not going to pretend to have all
[SPEAKER_01]: the answers because I absolutely don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I know who does, you know,
and all it takes is just like a phone call
[SPEAKER_01]: to get these absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so sort of like go hang out in a
network like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's a real good spot to be for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, along the lines of what you're
saying, there's, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that, you know, someone can
introduce you to that will change your
[SPEAKER_00]: life as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those things kind of with what
you're saying is, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me any girl that doesn't have a
dosing system and give me three dosatrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: an open sprinkler, and a leader pump,
and I will change your life in a
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will, you know, you'll think that
it's, it's, it's crazy what you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: with something just as simple with as
simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and people will, you know,
it'll change their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend half the time in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to IPM stuff or when it
comes to insert whatever sort of subject
[SPEAKER_01]: matter expert you're pulling in for this,
you say people that are that expertise and
[SPEAKER_01]: have done it and like actually walk the
walk and do it like nationwide or even
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally at this point,
like problem solve what those people and
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, Whoa, things were,
you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, so they're going to look
at problems in a whole new way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, not that it's a problem at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like done it, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, there's other fires to put out
besides the sort of mechanical aspects to
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, without any problems,
growing cannabis starts to become pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, uh, it should be, it should be
boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the end of the day, if,
if, uh, if you, if everything's going off,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you can probably run a hundred
light facility with two or three people,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of them should not be
spending more than 40 hours there a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think your numbers are pretty
right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, for anybody that's a home grower,
think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take knowledge that you're
learning either from these podcasts or
[SPEAKER_00]: from other shows or other educational
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can put yourself in that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is something like Jared said that
you are driven to do, because it does
[SPEAKER_00]: require a lot of dedication, but it can be
really rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, if it's working well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really like it, like I said,
it's rewarding and it's, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to find the right people
though, with the right, uh, mindsets to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with and work for in this community
though, because there are still a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, let's just say what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of assholes and it's not
just in this community and industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's across every industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, a life lesson to take
to find people that you like working with
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you can align your philosophies
with to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you are not there
struggling to get through to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: your shift or the end of the day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, like that's like me and
Jesse like met up at a spot that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's, you know, had to walk away
from and what that, you know, it's one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those things, but like, you know,
you meet somebody, you get to talk to them
[SPEAKER_01]: for 20 minutes and you're like,
huh, you're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, like next thing,
you know, you're like, how many years
[SPEAKER_01]: later, how much do I talk to you every
week?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of, um, you know,
across the board, like we'll probably
[SPEAKER_01]: start talking a lot after this too,
you know, one of those things of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally, almost every facility we've
ever worked at, I like still talk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people at those spots, like regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's like talking genetics or
whatever, plant stuff, or even cars,
[SPEAKER_01]: sneakers, food, whatever, you know,
kind of like, you know, you become friends
[SPEAKER_01]: with these people in the garden because
you shared something with them and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's real and it like carries on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tight knit community when it comes
down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's a, there's a lot of,
uh, issues with communities that are that
[SPEAKER_00]: tight knit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of incestuous, uh,
reciprocal, you know, fuckery that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the best in some cases,
but then you can build these long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: friendships and, and bonds with other
people that are within this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of ways that's, you know,
those are the people that will be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, the giants whose shoulders other
people are standing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas we're standing on the shoulders of
so many giants before us and all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit that they went through in the
prohibition era and are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even still, there's a lot of issues with
that now, but there's so much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that we're drawing from to be
able to help all these different growers
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect what they're doing in their own
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't start it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even the people that are
continuing to discover it because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in other agricultural
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just trying to make it the best
that we can with the information and the
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were given, given the legality and
history and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun stories of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of my homies went to college with
in Ohio 20 some years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he moved out here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he's a raft guide and ski bum
and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he used to trim all my,
um, products for me with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he went and got his MBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would listen to his like
textbooks while he's getting his MBA and
[SPEAKER_01]: trim circles and stuff, you know,
and like now his company's hired me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My company, I've hired it like whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, like, and like even
just going back to other stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I don't know who doesn't love
traveling, you know, kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, can't tell you how many trips to
Mexico, Costa Rica, you know, Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Croatia, Italy, like, you know,
like different sort of groups of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation people that have traveled the
world and done really cool shit together,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it all is because of this
plant, you know, you're all, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on some sailboat in Croatia doing
whatever, you know, kind of just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, rafting the grand Canyon,
like a whole bunch of wild motherfuckers
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, like I said, it's just one
of those things like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, like I said, it's a lifestyle and
you know, like sort of you stay,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm from Philly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Alan Iverson has a tattoo CT on
his neck, like crew thick, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it stands for, and I feel like that's one
of those things of, uh, yeah, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear I subscribed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you take care of your people and
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I feel that I feel like,
yeah, finding, finding the real ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry, you, you latch on and you
try to just build that group up even
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, yeah, I think that's a great
place to kind of end our main conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, let's, uh, let's go into a couple
of these fun little wrap up questions and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we'll wrap up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, favorite strain of all time loaded
question, but of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe when I was younger and I guess like
we still talking about still chasing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about it too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like the first time
you're like, you're like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a root, like a, a sour diesel or just
a diesel that like, when you would walk in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bar 15 years ago, you know,
but the Ziploc baggie and you could have a
[SPEAKER_01]: gram in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in the bar would point at you
and go, you have sour diesel on your
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I missed that diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I love some diesel first then
nowadays for talking older stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also like really love like a good Indiana
bubble gum is like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: love it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so like for some of the older stuff,
like your diesel, your bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like some headband,
like same kind of family and our circle of
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, like Chuck and John had this cut
of Hong Kong that, um, I bought a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different cuts of Hong Kong over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them have been anything like,
it's, I don't know what this really was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this Hong Kong was stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a buddy got arrested one time
and they walked him into the police office
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, he had smoked a couple
of grams out of the ounce kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but every pop in the police office,
I guess, kind of congratulated him on the
[SPEAKER_01]: way out because it made the whole office
smell kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Hong Kong was like, anytime you
stick that would come around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would load up for myself just
because it was like nothing I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was probably the first like
exotic cannabis I'd ever like latched
[SPEAKER_01]: onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, diesel bubble gum,
Hong Kong in the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've never heard of Hong Kong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, again, I have not, this one might've
been something else and mislabeled or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause all these Hong Kongs I've had since
have been not like you would not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's just not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so hunting for it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody has a Hong Kong, I'd love to
trade for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then the cookie rec, you know,
those seeds that I popped like 2011,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just smell, taste,
whatever, like it's performance enhancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it like makes you like
creative and tunnel vision of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like every broom stroke would be
the same if you're sweeping a floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like I swear you leave the house
and you're like uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the same spot on the highway,
you're like windows down, turn the music
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got this, you know, it's like
artistic and creative weed, like
[SPEAKER_01]: performance enhancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get some, some of the more
recent stuff, like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like now I'm older and don't want to be so
sped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I love some Cushman, like proper
Cushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know like what people might say,
whatever, like smell, taste, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how it makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at this point I want herb that
like, yeah, we all sit like this too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like something that opens your chest up
and gives you better posture is like one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the ways I like sort of judge cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I don't know, one stuff that
makes me feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love some like archive had that pie face
that came out a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a long time ago at this point
without a bunch of THCV in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like a diet weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so my girlfriend had me go hunt that
out and we found a really killer winner of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess most recent thing that's my new
favorite, um, scum tech and mean jeans pie
[SPEAKER_01]: scream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be like, that's like the best taste
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love that pie scream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard nothing but good things about
the pie scream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so, you know, it's stunning,
attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like as advertised, it's as
attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you would hope something is and it's
not purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like your CFM green, like almost
sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like gum green color, stunning test
35 plus a bunch of different spots for us
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're in a handful of spots we've
shared it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's like, you're like,
as advertised, like it smells,
[SPEAKER_01]: it tastes as good as it smells,
which is as good as it was, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ding, ding, ding, like down that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a very unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's fruity without being
runcish, you know, like it's, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very unique in its own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and that's, that's like my new
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate because I have this thing
where like, I really don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: ugly weed, even though I know sometimes
like a good diesel or something is just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look like bullshit when you're
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, compared to what you might be used to,
if you are growing these purples and the
[SPEAKER_00]: different runs and you know, candy gases
and all these different things that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, popular within the market,
those are pretty and fun to grow that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the senescence of them,
the color change, everything that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: to that plant as it grows, you're just
like, Oh, this is fun and enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, olio factorally, you know,
all these different things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, Oh, I love, I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think that's one of my pitfalls
where I'm just like, I don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: any green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I know that it might be good,
but I'm, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this new like mercy, you know,
not really new, but it's from gauge green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, out of Michigan, it's like TK by
glue by high school sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like green and sort of rubber
nostalgic Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tasted anything like that in a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of like a new favorite on
the list as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's green again and love it either
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's green again, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really shiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the sparkle, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's like green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is nowhere near purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been growing a cut of Sherb
cocktail lately and it is green with just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, tinges of purple as,
as it like in the last couple of days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is so loud and it's such a Yielder
that I'm just like, Oh, I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing green weed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, so that, you know, you have a,
of course with someone with your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, it's going to be really hard
to pick out one strain that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I'm totally fine with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being a bunch of different ones that
are developed over the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody at this point has just got one jar
on their table, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, what time of the day is
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, that's the,
we all have, I guess, options in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: us kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, but I guess I'm trying to pick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I just kind of got to cut a Durban
poison back and put that through that
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to run that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that used to be a favorite too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hadn't really seen something that was
like that textbook Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where it is 100% like
recognizable, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just coming out of dissection,
like as we speak pretty much kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't wait to get that back on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, nice question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, favorite breeder of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I can even pick one in all
honesty, or I guess sort of get through
[SPEAKER_01]: phases, you know, like went through an
archive phase for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, yeah, I guess did a whole
lot of archive work for a long time and
[SPEAKER_01]: just sort of like kept finding winners,
you know, of everything that cookie rec
[SPEAKER_01]: came from can of venture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess during COVID went on a total like
808 genetics out of Hawaii run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloom does killer work too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's kind of curtail this question
or specific set of, uh, interests and
[SPEAKER_00]: skill sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had to choose one breeder that
you were to curate your next quarterly cut
[SPEAKER_00]: menu from and hunt all of the seeds
yourself, you have, you know, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: unlimited time to hunt the seeds and
unlimited space to hunt all the seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to hunt, but you have to curate
your 18 cultivars or however many
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars for your clone list.
[SPEAKER_00]: What breeder would you go for to start
hunting through a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: packs?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, great job narrowing that question
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You nailed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was a really good sort of
parameters to put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it harder, but easier at the same
time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just trying to think like who's got
18 different things that's going to cross
[SPEAKER_01]: my menu that I want kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bloom at this point, like kind of
diverse enough where it's like going to
[SPEAKER_01]: touch your salary, going to touch like
fruit in the like different fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: categories kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to touch some nostalgic with also
being relevant and new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's probably my answer for lack of,
with your parameters, just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: who would I go holler at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's who I'd go holler at to go try
to pick 20 different things to go chase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, so I don't know, like,
you know, you need the diversity who like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause like, or, you know,
I don't know, like Alex from clear water
[SPEAKER_01]: has done a whole bunch of killer work over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he's really diverse too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd probably call Alex to be honest or
whatever between the two of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: either clear water or bloom, just because
I want a menu that's not so focused on one
[SPEAKER_01]: trait or, you know, I need a diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might immediately goes to CSI humble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're trying to curate with
a bunch of different flavors, I just pick
[SPEAKER_00]: up S ones of everything that I wanted to
run and 20 seeds of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You nailed it on like being able to
diversify a menu out of the gate that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's also your nostalgic classic
plus new, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, all right, your answer is better
than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's not about better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's, um, because you know,
a fully curated clear water, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: menu or a bloom menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, you're going to kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're going to have, you're going to
have a commercial viability out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you'll probably only need to pop
two or three packs of each genetic to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a true unicorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and run it and run it across
facilities across the entire country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, my methodology,
I need to pop like a couple hundred of
[SPEAKER_00]: each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like, I dunno, like both those guys
too, I feel like are very, like they touch
[SPEAKER_01]: older work, but they're also very current,
you know, so like you're making everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with their menus kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I've run lots of Alex's seeds over
the years and like always found winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't think I ever walked away
without something from packs of his that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll stick a bloomer Alex and clear
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a, uh, most memorable cannabis
related experience that you've had and
[SPEAKER_00]: want to share?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Whoa, tough question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's some, I'm going to do
this in like a three part answer kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you remember the first time you
hit two pounds of light, then you remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time you hit three pounds of
light and then you hit four, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like, so like, you know,
have like those like specific memories of
[SPEAKER_01]: like self accomplishment, you know,
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where you're like, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know I could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that, you know, and you pulled
something off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess maybe also like this cookie
rec strain, like never shared it really in
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, the 13 or 14 years,
whatever, you know, kind of been running
[SPEAKER_01]: around with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally started a whole breeding
project with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I feel like there's just sort of like
nothing, the way it makes you feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: out of all the genetics, like ever grown,
nothing is like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if there is a certain medicine in it,
you know, to, to do the studies and the
[SPEAKER_01]: research with like, this is the specimen I
would pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so like excited to finally started
breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and that kind of thing,
but Canada specific memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like also going just back to sort of like
the friends, like, you know, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: showing up somewhere, Costa Rica,
Mexico, wherever, even like, like went
[SPEAKER_01]: sailing through Croatia for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you show up with like your work,
you know, and these guys are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and you're with a group of
friends that have supported you and helped
[SPEAKER_01]: you like manage and get through all the,
you know, but you're, you're on the
[SPEAKER_01]: sailboat in the middle of Croatia,
you know, running around island hopping
[SPEAKER_01]: and the captain of your boat is like,
you know, calling ahead to the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the chefs come out to your table
and serve you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you gotta do is give them a little bit
of, you know, taste of your work kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, just like these rad
opportunities and like friendships that
[SPEAKER_01]: like it really, you know, and again,
it's probably a cop out of an answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, you know, like been through the
trenches was the gateway into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like cannabis was the connecting tie for,
for that experience to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to wrap that up, you know,
sort of become friends with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like I've always seen lots of
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was a good five year run,
you know, when I was younger, where I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: like 200 plus nights of live music a year
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, quite, you know, um,
um, you know, so I've made lots of friends
[SPEAKER_01]: in the music industry and like at this
point sort of, you know, have one friend
[SPEAKER_01]: that photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I'll trade him, um, you know,
some product and he'll give me prints from
[SPEAKER_01]: the shows and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, you know, sort of, I guess at
this point, sort of like you get to sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of share your work with the band,
you know, as playing at red rocks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so like you're getting the band
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got 10,000 people in the crowd
getting high off this music and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, so it goes back to like,
or I guess it's sort of a joke,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm trying to be serious about it and
like really want to put together this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole team of like sponsored artists and
athletes, but like I'll sponsor any
[SPEAKER_01]: artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'd give out herbs to all lots of
local musicians and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: just cause it's like, I don't know,
like go get the musician high that then
[SPEAKER_01]: plays the music that makes all the people
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kind of thing and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I don't know that sort of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the highlight for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, don't fucking get the people
high that make the other people happy and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, sort of get to stand there in the
crowd, but nobody know what you gave the
[SPEAKER_01]: band, all that we that they smoked and now
they're playing to the whole red rocks
[SPEAKER_01]: venue or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the coolest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a perfect thing to a
perfect way to answer that question and a
[SPEAKER_00]: great way to end the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Jared, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you taking the time to
talk and share your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, um, you know, I've made so many
friendships through doing this podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: hope there's my dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's asleep on the cat, but I've made so
many friends doing this podcast and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, made like connections that I feel like
will definitely last a long time or last a
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I feel that with you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time and joining me
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, well, hopefully we get to go do it
in real life and go make some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: memories soon, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some good stories, but I also,
you know, very much appreciate you
[SPEAKER_01]: inviting me on and getting to share the
story and kind of talk and all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I like to say, sharing these
stories helps the community grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall that's the way we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you and we'll talk soon
the next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
