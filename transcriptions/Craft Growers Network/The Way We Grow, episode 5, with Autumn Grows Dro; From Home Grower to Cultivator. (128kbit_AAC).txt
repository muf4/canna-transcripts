[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the way we grow podcast today our guest is
[SPEAKER_02]: autumn or at autumn grows dro on Instagram
She is a home grower and a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator I'm your host Nick wolf or mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wolf grows on Instagram and read it and so
autumn.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's new in your grow world?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me here by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited Yeah, I just started a new
sort of soil grow When I first learned I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned doing rock wall, so now I'm
learning soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty interesting Cool, I know what
type of soil are you using in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's peat moss perlite and it's actually
my co-workers kind of like set up Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: like their blend or something exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can look for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He definitely said So it sounds like
you're using like sort of like a living
[SPEAKER_02]: soil setup or something with is it like a
water only system for that or No,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using nutrients as well Okay,
yeah cool just using a different substrate
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than than rock wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Yeah, cool Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, I'll just get right into some of
these questions So what was your first
[SPEAKER_02]: experience growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you did you start growing other plants
before you?
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing cannabis Um, so I kind of
go back to like high school or middle
[SPEAKER_01]: school When you learned in science class
to grow a seed in a bag with the paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I did that but I never did it at
home So my first grow actually was
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis over a year ago Nice and Okay,
actually it led me to growing vegetables
[SPEAKER_02]: and fruits Now so I grow both Nice yeah,
we uh, we like to say that cannabis is the
[SPEAKER_02]: gateway drug to gardening It feels like if
if you weren't growing vegetables or fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything like that before you all of a
sudden get interested because you see how
[SPEAKER_02]: fast and vigorous like a cannabis plant
can grow and you're like, oh I can do
[SPEAKER_02]: other things now and That just leads you
into the garden as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome So what what got you
into growing cannabis then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you I mean were you a user beforehand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you just interested in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what got you into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts back in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually sold cannabis in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of like your high school plug
per se Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I started off with that and then
Last year I started smoking jungle boys
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was Curious to how they grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started watching videos on YouTube
and I was like I need to do this myself
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted to grow at home,
but I never had like the Equipment or
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally last year I had everything
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was luckily able to finance equipment
through Amazon So it made it a lot easier
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to start and just get equipment
through the stages then getting everything
[SPEAKER_01]: at once and It was just it was hard
financially to get started so having that
[SPEAKER_01]: finance helped a lot Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is that just kind of like a payment
plan thing where you get to like Like pay
[SPEAKER_02]: it off over time kind of absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's through Amazon It's called a
firm and you can pick Your APR and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to do for your plate payment plan
So it's really affordable that way to
[SPEAKER_02]: start Okay Well, I didn't even know that
that was like a thing that but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool I mean it does help people get
into it if they can't necessarily like
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is really expensive to get into
it especially like some of the lights and
[SPEAKER_02]: even the different nutrients and if you
have if you want different like control
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment or Monitoring equipment that can
get start to get really pricey really
[SPEAKER_02]: quick And as a home grower just wanting to
get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could understand not necessarily having
all those funds around I think I I put
[SPEAKER_02]: mine together slowly but surely as well
where it was like I think I started in I
[SPEAKER_02]: built a tent out of just like some spare
lumber that was around and like moving
[SPEAKER_02]: blankets And mylar blankets on the inside
for like the reflective surface and then a
[SPEAKER_02]: like I found like a hundred dollar LED
light on Amazon I think it was like five
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago or five and a half years ago now
And it was kind of a piece of crap,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it still worked and I still got I grew
ruts and it was awesome Turned out really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that when you first started?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like when I first started growing
where I was like really putting effort
[SPEAKER_02]: into trying to learn about how to Like
best grow cannabis because before that my
[SPEAKER_02]: partner and I had like had some plants
growing at one apartment that we lived at
[SPEAKER_02]: and we had You know, I've always been
users and before that my my dad grew and I
[SPEAKER_02]: like had one plant I think in high school
or something it was but in earnest It was
[SPEAKER_02]: only like five years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But okay, so let's see you evolve
pretty quickly in five years I a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: reading and a lot of time on like forums
and listening to videos and more reading
[SPEAKER_02]: And then applying those practices as as
much as I could so I tried to immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: get into like the commercial space and
from there it was just kind of every place
[SPEAKER_02]: that I worked at I learned something new
and I was able to apply it and when I had
[SPEAKER_02]: a home grow it was Yeah, it was all
applied at home so I could kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: reaffirm the actions rather than just
seeing how other people did it I could
[SPEAKER_02]: understand sort of the processes behind
it, but Yeah, I feel like in a lot there's
[SPEAKER_02]: so much accessible information nowadays
that it's easy to learn a lot in a short
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of time if you If it's like not
only your hobby, but you put your
[SPEAKER_02]: professional time into it as well as I'm
sure you know like so Back back to back to
[SPEAKER_02]: your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you you know, you you started growing
at home just a little over a year ago and
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us kind of your process of how you
figured out how you wanted to grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: then the processes you used because you
were pretty Successful early on I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of following your story Since you
started on Instagram when you were first
[SPEAKER_02]: helping manage someone else's cannabis
account.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's like talk about a little of Like
where your processes came from?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it did start when I started smoking
Jungle Boys flour that's when I started
[SPEAKER_01]: really researching like the Athena
nutrients line, which is what I use and
[SPEAKER_01]: using rock wool I kind of copied what
Jungle Boys does I first started off with
[SPEAKER_01]: the four inch cubes and When I met my
mentor Matt Which I found him off YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: searching Rockwell grows His were really
He just had a lot of information and more
[SPEAKER_01]: like scientific scientific facts and I
liked that about his page so I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Reached out to him and said hey,
could you help me grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my I'm on my first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing in four inch cubes using
Athena Could you help me from start to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish and he was more than willing to
help me?
[SPEAKER_01]: He would call me email me text me Just
tell me everything that he knows and I
[SPEAKER_01]: listened to everything he told me and I
was successful that way I believe growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in general that it's important to have
help and other resources Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely so what what were some of the
like the first methods that you were told
[SPEAKER_02]: would work for you and like When you said
that you followed the the Athena method or
[SPEAKER_02]: the Jungle Boys method I are you referring
to kind of like their their handbook and
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of what they had like described about
in there and then Like how did you how did
[SPEAKER_02]: you go about that first grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually they have a YouTube video on
how to grow and how they do it so I kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of just Rewinded it and just paused and
prep and just wrote down everything list
[SPEAKER_01]: by list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what do I need to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: and then when I went to a hydroponics
store my first time I bought Athena
[SPEAKER_01]: products there and they gave me a free
handbook when I bought Athena and That's
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started learning more through the
handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Okay So what do you think since since
you have been growing first, you know a
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat shorter amount of time and It
seems as though you've made significant
[SPEAKER_02]: changes in your grow from like each of
your grows How do you feel like those
[SPEAKER_02]: changes have gone and sort of what has
been like the things that you've learned
[SPEAKER_02]: from those different?
[SPEAKER_01]: changes So I feel like each grow I advance
and I just learn more and more in general
[SPEAKER_01]: even with my setups Right now I don't have
a proper drainage system for My plants but
[SPEAKER_01]: I make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have little caddies they sit on and they
have drainage trays so I Have to manually
[SPEAKER_01]: drain out the trays and I get a lot of
floods because of that, but luckily
[SPEAKER_01]: they're up above They're up above and I've
learned Throughout growing of how many
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigations shot So I should be giving my
plants so that way I don't get so much
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff Okay, and these words that I'm
using I would have never used in my very
[SPEAKER_01]: first grow Like I I wouldn't have no idea
to say irrigation shots and runoff It's
[SPEAKER_01]: just stuff like kind of words.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just learn over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure I mean it I feel like it it
is a really There's so much specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: within like the commercial or the
cultivation culture of cannabis where We
[SPEAKER_02]: have these terms that we've created as a
community over like however many decades
[SPEAKER_02]: of growing and even some of those terms
have changed and evolved over time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of it was because it was Almost
like you had to talk about it this way
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was illegal and you didn't want
people to know exactly what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about but even now there seems to
be a lot of like not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: proprietary, but it it feels like Like a
lot of it is just Very unique to cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and to cannabis cultivation shots might
not be I don't I don't know if that's
[SPEAKER_02]: referred to in other forms of like
horticulture or agriculture where they use
[SPEAKER_02]: drip emitters and because like there's
some tomatoes that are grown on rockwool
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a lot of other crops grown on
rockwool and hydroponic systems and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, but Yeah, it's very it's a
great point where like A lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: hear this stuff if they're trying to get
into cultivation and they don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: understand these different terms What do
you think was one of like the the other
[SPEAKER_02]: than the terminology what do you think was
one of the biggest learning curves you had
[SPEAKER_02]: like getting into growing Like what were
some of the things that you were found to
[SPEAKER_02]: need the most of your attention when when
learning about it I think it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: important to know each Stage for sure and
know when your plants are ready to switch
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important to have a
handbook or some kind of dosage for your
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients I feel like that helps Protect
you from any deficiencies if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: something to look at and measure by I
believe that's really important and Also
[SPEAKER_01]: like learning the steps that you need to
do for each stage my when I first grew I
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't really realize there was all these
steps that you needed to do at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: day or week Now that I am in a commercial
setting I have learned more of like for
[SPEAKER_01]: instance day 10 is The day that we like to
skirt our plants or lollipop Some others
[SPEAKER_01]: might think you know differently or do
things differently and that's fine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've just learned throughout,
you know growing that there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different times in certain days that you
should do things to not stress your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: out and To have a better grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like so much of it is somewhat
subjective Like for me, I don't like to do
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the skirting until the the plants
have finished stretching and like finish
[SPEAKER_02]: their flower set I agree I think you know,
depending on the different that like
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the setup it could It could
be beneficial because I know one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen when pruning early in the
stretch is you get a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetative response so like the plants
will sometimes get a little bit taller
[SPEAKER_02]: than they might otherwise So if you have a
large space or if you have a canopy that
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be filled up still that might be
beneficial But if you have a smaller space
[SPEAKER_02]: or a lower ceiling height or something
then you really want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just getting the plants to stretch
as much as they will based on your
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation practices or the the genetic
potential of the plant or otherwise and
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way when you prune they kind of
just stay right where they are already
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense because this
grow I listened to what my boss is saying
[SPEAKER_01]: skirt at day 10 and I have some sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first time growing sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty fun and I was expecting
really tall plants But my strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up being really short and that's it
could be because I skirted too early you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and um, I think also some of the
genetics like when they when they say like
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa or indica it can sometimes be a
little misleading because It's like some
[SPEAKER_02]: sativas now are so far bred away from
where they were That's it's sometimes like
[SPEAKER_02]: the the effects that are described as
sativa versus the growth pattern Because I
[SPEAKER_02]: usually like to describe it as like
equatorial versus I forget the other one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but basically like if it's near the
equator versus every Latitude that it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: up and gets further away from the equator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like they get squatter and squatter
just based on the the lighting cycles and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but Yeah, sometimes I feel like
that might be a little bit misleading with
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of what you would assume the
structure to be as a grower When someone
[SPEAKER_02]: says sativa or indica So, uh, let's talk
then about like what your current grow
[SPEAKER_02]: right now so Why don't you go over sort of
what you're doing for your hydroponic
[SPEAKER_02]: setup and then what you're doing for your
with the rockwool and then how it differs
[SPEAKER_02]: from what you're doing with the the
potting mix base So in my experience right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, I want to say hydroponics is easier
It's just less headache even with
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use three different nutrients core bloom
and grow just three things and then with
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil I'm using like eight to ten
different things and It just kind of feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm more like a scientist in soil
growing but But I feel like it's it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: more time to you know, measure everything
out You know get everything precise and
[SPEAKER_01]: and for my hydroponic grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super quick I can weigh out
everything super fast and have my
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir ready in like ten minutes But it
took me like half an hour just to do four
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons for my soil grow Just adding all
the little you know things nutrients when
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're doing when you're using the
Athena for your hydroponics, are you using
[SPEAKER_02]: the Athena Pro line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, okay Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that three-part fertilizers are
really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it It does make life really easy
and then so what when you're doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: Athena Are you running like any like
supplemental co2 anything else and then
[SPEAKER_02]: like what are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Running your EC at and kind of what are
some of the targets that you shoot for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of your grows do look really
nice and for someone that has only been
[SPEAKER_02]: growing for a little over a year It's it's
really great to see people that have
[SPEAKER_02]: success because it shows that other people
can do this too at home without you know
[SPEAKER_02]: if they enjoy smoking cannabis or if they
enjoy consuming it and they Don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep spending the money, but they also
enjoy like the hobby of gardening I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's really important for people to
see that they can Be successful in their
[SPEAKER_02]: grows at home early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, it's very doable for sure,
but I think Having a mentor definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me learn things a lot quicker
understand things better If I didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: someone to guide me I probably would be a
little held back and Maybe not know as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as I do now for sure I was running
co2 and it's kind of Expensive to be
[SPEAKER_01]: honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running through it like every week a
25 pound Tank and I was spending $45 every
[SPEAKER_01]: week on it and it just became too
expensive I didn't notice a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference not having it But it did hurt
me because when I ran out I Didn't have an
[SPEAKER_01]: exhaust in one of my grows and I
experienced some mold problems And I lost
[SPEAKER_01]: probably like I Don't know I I yielded one
and a half pounds and I've could have
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten like at least two pounds So I feel
like that hurt me a little bit and set me
[SPEAKER_01]: back But instead of running co2 I got an
exhaust and hopefully no mold this time
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean Definitely if you're if
you're running co2 in a tent and it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard if you're Especially if you're
like getting into the beginning of summer
[SPEAKER_02]: or something along those lines where the
it's everything starts to heat up And you
[SPEAKER_02]: have all that transpiration Yeah,
it becomes really hard to mitigate mold if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not exhausting that that extra
humidity And and usually I find like
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with tent grows That exhaust is
so important that co2 can sometimes you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you do run into like where you're
just running through it so quickly or The
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that the tents are usually you know
mesh and they're semi permeable You have a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of loss through the zippers and
and the different ducts and whatnot so it
[SPEAKER_02]: does It does become a little bit like hard
to keep up with the cost of it Even if it
[SPEAKER_02]: does get you a little bit more like chunky
chunky flowers at the end of it So I get
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've always wanted to run co2 at
home, but I feel like you do have to You
[SPEAKER_02]: would have to then like have this whole
Setup and it was just something that I
[SPEAKER_02]: never was able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, you need like air conditioning
and you need Definitely dehumidification
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these different things and all
that adds onto your electrical cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I don't think it's that important
Even though if you look at videos on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube, they're always like oh you co2
It's gonna help your yield and it might
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's gonna cost you a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely like in a commercial
space where you have the ability to air
[SPEAKER_02]: condition and and control humidity and
other environmental factors then it it
[SPEAKER_02]: almost would make It would make less sense
to not run it You almost have to run it in
[SPEAKER_02]: order for the all the equipment to run at
peak performance And and for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase your yields by by that amount,
you know, I always think like It's not
[SPEAKER_02]: like you get like this this double return
though Or like you if you can add co2 and
[SPEAKER_02]: then peak every like all the other
parameters out like your PPFD and your
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and humidity and The
differentials for all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: settings for day and night and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just you still probably won't double
your output If you add co2 buddy If you're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get everywhere everything else to
that point that it seems like it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: worth it no matter what But yeah,
not necessarily in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a totally different
situation That's what my my mentor taught
[SPEAKER_01]: me to do because he does that at his home
grows But he has an open space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it a lot better to use if you
have an open space, I believe Like a like
[SPEAKER_02]: a room or something that he has like yeah
sealed off or something Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying with the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not it So yeah, yeah,
I I wouldn't use co2 again unless I have
[SPEAKER_01]: open space or a bigger grow Yeah,
absolutely it's it's it doesn't hurt,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it makes me think of those like
Those exhaust bags or I forget what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're called But they're basically like
a mushroom block that you can wet down and
[SPEAKER_02]: hang inside the grow and it Because
mushrooms produce co2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're all just making making co2 with
mushrooms But what's funny is I bought one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those bags I bought one of those bags
and then yeah, my mentor was like just get
[SPEAKER_01]: a tank And I returned the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never even used it Well, I don't know
how much they actually produce yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've I've seen people where I
think at one point on like the build a
[SPEAKER_02]: soil YouTube channel he had his 10 by 10
tent Being and he exhausted into it from a
[SPEAKER_02]: mushroom tent So it pulled all the co2 and
cooler air into that tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's not a bad idea
especially if you're in like Colorado like
[SPEAKER_02]: he is and You're pulling all that extra
humidity into the tent as well to
[SPEAKER_02]: compensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's not a bad idea Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes me want to like grow some
oyster mushrooms and some shiitake
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes I want to do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right and I So I had grown
organically at one point in like a 30
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon pot and used local like super soil
Living living soil blend and indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and It produced so much co2 that like
the parts per million at the surface of
[SPEAKER_02]: the the substrate were like 800 and so it
like made it did its own thing because it
[SPEAKER_02]: had all the Fungal colonies in the
substrate already basically acted like a
[SPEAKER_02]: giant mushroom block So that was pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah, how much did you grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yield off your plant if I can ask Remember
off of it was one plant under in a four by
[SPEAKER_02]: four area and I'm pretty I I only weighed
like a quarter of it because by the time
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had it all all dried and done I had
kind of just like divvied it up and then
[SPEAKER_02]: realized I hadn't weighed it so I weighed
what was the remaining quarter of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like 2.1 pounds out of that one
space the one area and it was under a 340
[SPEAKER_02]: watt LED so it was pretty good for for
that little over 2 grams per watt And that
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty nice And it was like one single
plant to in this giant pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I vegged it for like a month and a
half It was crazy But it was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah so you have So tell us a little bit
more than about your hydroponic setup What
[SPEAKER_02]: like what do you see are you running and
what are some of the other Targets that
[SPEAKER_01]: you usually look for So in early veg I
start off with 1.0 EC At my job They start
[SPEAKER_01]: off 3.0 and run it all the way 3.0 from
start to finish But I was taught to start
[SPEAKER_01]: at like 1.0 and then kind of work your way
up slowly to 3.0 EC But for the runoff Do
[SPEAKER_02]: you see a difference between those two
methods?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for a little sidetrack, but do you
see a difference between those two
[SPEAKER_02]: methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do I see less stress and Kind of like I
didn't really have deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just more stress for sure and I had
some yellowing going on but nothing too
[SPEAKER_01]: concerning when I was just pushing 3.0
from the start to End I like to ease up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that helps better for the
plants Or they like it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I hear that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's good to just have one more
Anecdotal evidence to say so I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially they kind of just they start
at 3.0 just to like push it and get it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know going Because commercial is just
bam-bam fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get these in and get them out,
you know, but at home you can have The
[SPEAKER_01]: patience and start off slow with your EC
and you know get all the way to 3.0 but
[SPEAKER_02]: with my EC runoff All the plants get a
little bit of extra treatment too because
[SPEAKER_02]: you got you know, you got the time to take
to To hang out with each plant
[SPEAKER_02]: individually basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and and for the runoff I was taught
to not go over 9 EC But I've also been
[SPEAKER_01]: taught to not go over 7 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean I've gone over 9 and Yeah,
I had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had your runoff EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm Wow, and I noticed It was kind of
towards the end Like around week five or
[SPEAKER_01]: six where my runoff was that high and it
was good The colors were coming in great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the leaves were just kind of getting a
little crispy burnt tips but I mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: part of like the fade per se so But right
now I'm having my EC at our EC runoff at 7
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to go past that and my
plants seem pretty happy with that Nice
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I I've seen EC like yeah
wait in the runoff way over 9 and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like it I think sometimes it depends on
the Size of the substrate as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like have like a four inch rock
hole and you have a really high EC coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it there's and you're also getting
a pretty big dry back then Typically like
[SPEAKER_02]: I I think like at the point of dry back
that you see in the substrate is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be more than what the runoff EC is going
to be just because of the lack of water
[SPEAKER_02]: and as the water like goes away and any
salts that are left in there it just keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: compounding how how much Salt is felt by
the roots in terms of the osmotic stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have a bigger pot though and
You can have like, you know, if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: 9.0 EC runoff in that but then it's not
drying back as far Usually that still
[SPEAKER_02]: means that like the the the pore water EC
isn't spiking up past Or to the same point
[SPEAKER_02]: that the smaller substrate was so I could
see how like especially in rockwell just
[SPEAKER_02]: how dry sometimes they can get between The
end of the day and the first irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could probably get some pretty
darn high ECs in there and get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of that tip burning and stuff I could
see that did you did you find though that
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're getting that little extra
stress in the plants did you feel as
[SPEAKER_02]: though the the terpene profile or any of
the other like Like secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_02]: and tertiary metabolites like the the
trichome production and the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: production increase because sometimes I
see like the trichome production just goes
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy when you get all these really far
dry backs and high ECs and Sometimes like
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can start to get these really
pungent days where they start to really
[SPEAKER_01]: smell Yes, I noticed like How would I say
it just like more colors coming in and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah more smells
[SPEAKER_01]: And It seemed like I was getting a lot of
moisture too in the buds and maybe that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why I had some mold issues, too Okay,
when you when you say like you were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a lot of moisture in the buds What
do you what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just like were you seeing stuff
on the buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: No But you could just tell like that they
were wet by when you would default like
[SPEAKER_01]: when you take off a leaf It just seemed
super like wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my other grow When I pulled off
leaves from my other grow it was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: more like a dry when the leaves came off
It just like snap off, but with the higher
[SPEAKER_02]: you see the leaves felt more wet
Interesting Almost like they were a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more leathery or something like they
had a kind of a thicker like the leaf was
[SPEAKER_01]: almost thicker or something or I guess
when you know when you pull a leaf off and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes they come off like super crispy
and then sometimes they come off and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get like a little like I Guess they they
say it's like the plants blood or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: when you pull off a leaf But I felt like
it's like it's just kind of like okay I
[SPEAKER_02]: see what you're saying like almost like
where you break it off at water Water will
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of the plant or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely like it has Like there's
there's a high Water pressure in the in
[SPEAKER_02]: the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes When you when you see that happen when
you see that happening Do the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: usually have a lot of turgor like where
all the leaves are kind of praying up
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the light?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Yeah, okay, definitely so like yeah
like the turgor of the plants is usually
[SPEAKER_02]: based on like the how much internal water
pressure is in the vascular structure of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant so Yeah, if you pop leaves off
then I've definitely noticed that as well
[SPEAKER_02]: like sometimes I've just been popping
leaves and I'll get like Splashes on my
[SPEAKER_02]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I'll be like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wipe it but it's like plant juice So
it kind of just makes my glasses all
[SPEAKER_02]: smudged and smeared and so I'm just like,
oh, yeah I totally have experienced that
[SPEAKER_02]: as well So, okay then so are you does that
mean then you're ramping up your grow at
[SPEAKER_02]: home up to 3.0 EC Is that like kind of
where you where you're you'll end at
[SPEAKER_02]: before you and then Do you taper it back
down then from there towards the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes, so that's what my my teacher
taught me to do to just lower your EC
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other day or so and just kind of go
by each like point And come down to like
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.0 or 1.5 But I've only done that I feel
like once The other times I've just kept
[SPEAKER_01]: it at 3.0 till harvest day Nice and it was
smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't taste harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never flushed my plants before I
Might try that this time just by flushing
[SPEAKER_01]: it with maybe just some RO water at the
last three days I just want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: different things to see what happens Sure,
if I can get a better taste colors smells
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff like that I did move up to six inch
Hugo's now I started off with the four
[SPEAKER_01]: inch cubes on my first grow and then My
mentor told me if you want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially you should try the six inch
cubes So I tried those and I've noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: way bigger plants with the six inch And
just bigger colas For sure do you do you
[SPEAKER_02]: notice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes I feel like going from a
four inch to a six inch cube you can You
[SPEAKER_02]: can tend to over water a little bit early
on with the six inch cube if you're used
[SPEAKER_02]: to Watering in a four inch cube and the
dry backs that a four inch will get even
[SPEAKER_02]: early on in veg did you find that you were
getting like excess leaf production or
[SPEAKER_02]: longer internodes between the different
flower sites on the plant as it grew or
[SPEAKER_02]: did you feel as though it just kind of You
didn't notice too much of a difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: that in terms of like how you felt as
though it like if it's like Generative
[SPEAKER_02]: leaning where it's like a lot of flower
production versus vegetative leaning where
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of has more Leafy flowers and
longer internodes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like with the six inch it was more
of a leafy internodes Yeah, I just overall
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just they seem like bigger plants and
six inch But maybe that's just because I
[SPEAKER_01]: used four inch my first grow and now that
I'm evolving maybe I'm just getting bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: plants who knows For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I always say that to people when they're
like they'll Implement, you know early on
[SPEAKER_02]: in their grow career.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll add something new to their grow or
they'll Change something and they'll go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh this change made me a better grower And
I always tell them like no the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: you you grew one more time makes you a
better grower Usually it's just the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience that helps people get better
and they're just taking the experience
[SPEAKER_02]: from each successive harvest and applying
it to the next one and usually it's
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's a culmination of both like
if you if you were doing something either
[SPEAKER_02]: to Hindu yourself or if you do implement
Something that is beneficial to the grow
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be then in conjunction with the
increase in skill as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I yeah, that's a it's a good point So,
okay, then I feel like that kind of gives
[SPEAKER_02]: us a good picture of how you grow
hydroponically with your rock wool so tell
[SPEAKER_02]: us more about your your new setup that
you're trying out with the the potting
[SPEAKER_01]: soil the the peat based media,
so It's a little like I'm kind of going at
[SPEAKER_01]: it blindly a little because my co-worker
Has or he has this tent that he let me
[SPEAKER_01]: borrow behind me It's the same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use for my hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both gorilla tents My hydro has
the four by four and the soil grow doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is a five by five With the four by four
I'm using ion LED lights a 20 watts and
[SPEAKER_01]: With the soil, it's a fluent LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how many watts though Okay,
it's probably like seven seven twenty or
[SPEAKER_02]: seven eighty if if it's the one that I see
right behind you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so as nutrients It seems like I have
everything individually Some are in
[SPEAKER_01]: liquids and then some are in powdered form
The nitrogen is in powdered form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a soybean base nitrogen And then
I have phosphate carbon silica and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: all in liquid forms Okay, what brand is it
that you're using I have no idea It
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no brand name or it's just in
random bottles like this
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and this is from your co-worker yes,
okay, so it sounds like they make nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah, so it's a little different um,
yeah He he said it's kind of like a secret
[SPEAKER_01]: that someone his mentor came up with the
nutrients and everything so he doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really Tell me much about it, but he just
tells me the measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm kind of going at it blindly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Have you taken like an EC or a pH
measurement of the the solution that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I tested my EC with just carbon
and nitrogen and my EC or is PPM it was at
[SPEAKER_01]: like 700 PPM I think that's like 0.5 EC or
something starting off low I think it's um
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending some of the PPMs, you know,
I always forget if it's you double the PPM
[SPEAKER_02]: You multiply it by a thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah double and then divide by a thousand
So 700 be like 1.4.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Is it yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure But so is that and that's
just two parts of it and then you add all
[SPEAKER_02]: these other parts as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes They're like all these little bottles
separate things It's a lot like a
[SPEAKER_02]: milliliter of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes a gram of this Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a bunch of little tiny
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and when you're watering these Are
you watering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Them to runoff or are you avoiding runoff
with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing runoff and then I'm also
doing some flushing with the soil Like
[SPEAKER_01]: once a week flushing I started them off in
rockwell cubes like the starter plugs So I
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of had to do some flushing to get the
salts out and then start with the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrients, okay Yeah, but it's a lot to
have like eight different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients going on and having to measure
like of an eighth of a teaspoon and Times
[SPEAKER_01]: that by how many gallons I'm doing so it's
kind of a headache to be honest But
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that was over like however many
parts always kind of I like shied away
[SPEAKER_02]: from them earlier on like at one point I
think I was mixing like 10 or 12 different
[SPEAKER_02]: parts at this one grow I was working at
and then we we'd like mix them all and
[SPEAKER_02]: then hand water all the plants with it and
it was It just seemed like such a hassle
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I tried even at home like It's
time-consuming absolutely And it just you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I I never saw anything that I was
like so blown away with that I was just
[SPEAKER_02]: like Wow, this is this is the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly how we should be growing
this plant and then I saw like living soil
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was just water only and That I
was just like oh well this seems really
[SPEAKER_02]: easy yeah, but then reamending it started
to become something that did require like
[SPEAKER_02]: if you wanted to do it at scale or At a
very like either professional or
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific level of understanding exactly
what was going on so that you could make
[SPEAKER_02]: like a fully educated Adjustment or
addition if it's like a dry amendment or
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of tea or something you would
need to do all these like substrate
[SPEAKER_02]: saturated paste tests and then even
Compare it to like sap analysis of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and other things like that so that
you could understand sort of how those
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrient packets were impacting the soil
and then how that was over time
[SPEAKER_02]: Translating to the plant and so you could
kind of treat like if you were doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently You could see the trends over
time of what was in the plant and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there were some resources online that you
could see where those targets were that
[SPEAKER_02]: you would want and you could increase or
lower than what your nutrient package was
[SPEAKER_02]: that you were adding to the substrate,
but that's something that's like it's only
[SPEAKER_02]: available to do that at a commercial level
because each one of those tests is like
[SPEAKER_02]: either a hundred dollars or more and if
you're doing it weekly or Monthly then
[SPEAKER_02]: that that also It's like the co2 and a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that's almost it's untenable You
can't necessarily afford that if if the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole if one of the ideas for home growing
is to grow your own medicine Then like
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing the price of it almost makes it
in some cases Especially when you have
[SPEAKER_02]: readily accessible Cannabis in a medical
or a recreational market Sometimes it ends
[SPEAKER_02]: up being cheaper, especially with the
commercial race to the bottom Where
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's just trying to get as much
product sold for the lowest amount and it
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes doesn't even matter if it's
super high quality Yeah, I can agree for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure Also, how are you liking this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic grow style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean other than the time-consuming part
Yeah, I really don't like the
[SPEAKER_01]: time-consuming part that is not It for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so when I first started I cut clones
off my hydro grow and Nursed them into veg
[SPEAKER_01]: and put them in the soil and I noticed
because I was just using carb and carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: Not nitrogen at first So I started
noticing yellowing and deficiencies and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, oh no, I'm already messing up
the soil grow but my co-worker Was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like oh just add nitrogen the yellowing
should go away quickly and I'm like
[SPEAKER_01]: really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I added nitrogen the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed the yellowing just kind of
slowly going away But within a day The
[SPEAKER_01]: yellowing was almost gone That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fast acting for something like Like
in an organic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me want to know like like what it
is It sounds like almost like a soy
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrolystate or something like that where
it's like a amino based nitrogen source
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something that's like right there
readily available That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of sounded like what you were
saying to like with the living soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of adding like your own Ingredients
and seeing how the plant reacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep Yeah, I could see how it you know,
it's probably good for all new growers to
[SPEAKER_02]: use something that requires them to pay
attention to the plants needs and and then
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a response appropriate that kind of
addresses those needs and so that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see the progress of the plant from your
additions because I feel like sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's Like if you if you do
hydroponics and you do it correctly or if
[SPEAKER_02]: you follow directions and you're not
necessarily trying to be so easy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you follow the directions in the
most cases they work really well,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's a lot of directions out there
that are Unique to the specific nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: or unique to a specific environment And so
a lot of these different recipes are
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat subjective because they need to
follow specific parameters But if you like
[SPEAKER_02]: follow all the instructions, you should be
good As long as you don't try to get fancy
[SPEAKER_02]: or you know, try to be like I'm gonna
double this or half this just because I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to see what happens like sure see
what happens, but it probably You're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: see like what a deficiency looks like or a
toxicity looks like But yeah with like a
[SPEAKER_02]: organic grow or something where you do
like I'm adding this for nitrogen or this
[SPEAKER_02]: for calcium or this for Magnesium or this
for potassium phosphorus all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: constituents I could see how that could be
pretty helpful, especially if you like Do
[SPEAKER_02]: it long enough where you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna pull a bunch of phosphorus
out of the the nutrients package and let's
[SPEAKER_02]: see what happens so you can then like
document it almost and be like I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: this works When I have the phosphorus at X
level and if I bring it down to Y level
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you then see that happening,
you can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I need to add more phosphorus I like
that you put it that way And kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a learning way of growing because you're
adding one component At different times or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever not like how with Athena it's all
together in one so you're not gonna really
[SPEAKER_01]: have to stress about phosphorus or silica
separately or whatever and Like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying you could add a bunch of phosphorus
and if the plant loves it, then you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It loves that Check off the list Yeah,
it's more like a science experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly yeah, there's a I brought it up in
the last podcast, but I might as well
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it up again, but there's a a term or
a Theory or a lot it's called Liebig's
[SPEAKER_02]: law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe but basically what it is is It's
kind of like the law of minimums almost
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can only Achieve your greatest
results based on what is the the lowest
[SPEAKER_02]: Available Nutrient in like a growth system
and so like sometimes it'll be described
[SPEAKER_02]: as like staves and a barrel So like a wine
barrel where all the different staves that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of go around the outside of the
barrel are all tightly compressed together
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all at the same height and so
you can fill the the wine in the barrel up
[SPEAKER_02]: to that height but if one of those staves
is cut lower then Even though all those
[SPEAKER_02]: other levels are all the way up at the top
The wine can only fill up to where that
[SPEAKER_02]: lowest stave is so it's like if you if
that's your If that's your limiting factor
[SPEAKER_02]: then even if you have all these other
elements within the grow at their peak or
[SPEAKER_02]: at their their Like ideal levels You'll
never be able to see what results that
[SPEAKER_02]: those can truly provide if there's
something else that isn't at its most
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal level in in sort of that same
specific environment that you're providing
[SPEAKER_02]: all these things in because like Sometimes
like more humidity in one environment is
[SPEAKER_02]: not as good as more humidity in another
environment Whether it be like co2
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting heat Exhaust all these different
things that can have an effect on that But
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's cool to see a newer grower like
yourself using these different tools of a
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic grow And then a hand-mixed
painstaking Organic grow because it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: round you out as a grower though because
it's it's great to see other people doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that because I felt like that was one of
the ways that I learned the most is Just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to different styles of growing
Almost every second grow I would switch it
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the first grow it would either work
or it wouldn't work that well I do it
[SPEAKER_02]: again the second time and I usually get it
to work and then I go okay This is boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna do something else And then I
yep, and then it like started at
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics and ended at hydroponics for
me because it's so easy Like you use
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah at work we use cocoa Have you done
Rockwell grows at the facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so at the facility that I manage
we've done cocoa and we do cocoa now and
[SPEAKER_02]: we have for quite some time, but We've
done Rockwell as well where we did the
[SPEAKER_02]: slab Where you have three plants per slab
on the four inch cubes and that worked
[SPEAKER_02]: really well We've done where we've done
four inch cubes for veg and then we set
[SPEAKER_02]: those on top of cocoa pots and let them
root into the cocoa pots and Go about it
[SPEAKER_02]: that way but there is like a little bit of
a intense osmotic gradient between
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockwell and cocoa where the cocoa wants
to pull all the water out of the Rockwell
[SPEAKER_02]: and So you have to provide all these
little irrigation shots early on to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that it roots in correctly and
usually that keeps it a little bit too
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative early on and you don't get that
It's not as easy to build the EC early in
[SPEAKER_02]: in flower in the substrate Which usually
we we aim for to get that generative
[SPEAKER_02]: response of a lot of flower sets and stuff
Yeah, I just want to say it's really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: to see another person entering their
cannabis cultivation journey and Using
[SPEAKER_02]: these different methods to learn from
yeah, I like to learn all different
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects every way you can do it Let's
learn it and find the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my goal For sure at my job they
They grow everything in Rockwell,
[SPEAKER_01]: right even our moms are in Rockwell cubes,
but Just recently they started switching
[SPEAKER_01]: over to cocoa for the moms Just because
the six-inch Hugo's aren't big enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold those moms and our moms were flopping
over every day and it was just a mess and
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think now they're that yeah,
yeah So yeah switching over to cocoa and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming they're liking it better I
haven't been up in bed Since they've done
[SPEAKER_01]: that but all the moms now are in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more Rockwell for them Cocoa can also
be a little bit cheaper You can get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of a larger substrate size for
the same price as Rockwell So like I think
[SPEAKER_02]: those six inches, especially if they're
grow Dan I think those are getting up
[SPEAKER_02]: there in price now above like four bucks
apiece and I think we can get a like a two
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon cocoa pot for Like a buck fifty to
two bucks apiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So You can get a lot more a lot more
substrate out of it and a lot more runtime
[SPEAKER_02]: out of each mom But I always personally
suggest even in home grows and commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces to keep your mom Lifespan to no
longer than like eight weeks at the max.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually shoot for like between six and
eight weeks sometimes they'll go into ten
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, but that's usually if it's like
Yeah, it's usually if it's like a Like
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I'm needing to keep around
for genetic preservation or something
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some of the larger moms actually,
you know, like sometimes they'll go up to
[SPEAKER_02]: to to like us like 90 days If like it's an
instant a much larger pot and if I up pot
[SPEAKER_02]: it like once a month It really depends on
kind of what what time of year it is and
[SPEAKER_02]: how long we need to keep moms Around for
but I like to keep them around for as
[SPEAKER_02]: little amount of time as possible
Sometimes you just get like fungus now
[SPEAKER_02]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have a lot of fungus nets and They
have us top down the moms every week
[SPEAKER_01]: there's probably like I Don't know like 30
different strains of moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a lot going on in veg My job
for sure You guys have around like 30 30
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars on your list at any given time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Okay, they like that because it that's
a decent list Yeah, they said more strains
[SPEAKER_01]: better because it helps push product
quicker than just having ten different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains the same strains if they have 30
different strains or more for sure Are
[SPEAKER_02]: they are they usually growing all 30?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like at any given time Yeah,
and they keep their moms pretty long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah They keep their moms all the way to
like I think the most eight months They've
[SPEAKER_01]: kept their moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, those are huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they I assume them that they're in
probably like high bay rooms with like
[SPEAKER_01]: High-intensity discharge lighting like CMH
or HPS I think they just use Gavita bar
[SPEAKER_01]: lights Oh Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Awesome Do they have a pretty big
growing area for each mom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah There's probably I want to say
like eight maybe eight to ten different
[SPEAKER_01]: tables of the long tables Okay,
and probably like like longer than a four
[SPEAKER_01]: by eight table Yes Okay Like that like a
custom drain table is yeah exactly Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're feeding like at least Like three
to four different strains per table and
[SPEAKER_01]: like I want to say ten different Well,
the three strains three to four strains
[SPEAKER_01]: per table and like ten plants per strain
Okay, so like uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so those are gonna be really those are
big plants like um, yeah, I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: like two two across per Like two across on
on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those are big moms then that's
pretty cool Yeah, we have like we have two
[SPEAKER_02]: tiers on on our tables and both are like
veg and our mom room and so But they only
[SPEAKER_02]: have like I think 38 inches and 48 inches
or no 46 inches something like that That's
[SPEAKER_02]: like the the total height from the tray to
the light So we have to like splay them
[SPEAKER_02]: out as much as we can and keep them really
short and you have to top them down every
[SPEAKER_02]: week We try to top them down every week
Yeah, but we are also like a very small
[SPEAKER_02]: team So sometimes they they'll grow into
the lights and we'll usually just be like
[SPEAKER_02]: well Those are gonna get pruned and then
they're gonna grow again and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll be okay Yeah, I would love to have
Large high bay ceilings in a veg space
[SPEAKER_02]: because then you can get really really big
palms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, they're like trees Yeah,
so what made you decide to enter from just
[SPEAKER_02]: home growing into the the cultivation
space Um, I really want to make this a
[SPEAKER_01]: career So I started looking on Craigslist
zip recruiter for cultivation jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a trimming job For this brand high
key on my shirt High key is our dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: that we grow for My boss is married and
his wife runs high key and he runs the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow operations called fifth period And I
originally actually applied to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmer for high key and When I told them
I trim my own Flower at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, hey, we need a Grower for
cultivation would you be interested and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hell yeah That's exactly what I
want to do because I was gonna start off
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming and work my way to cultivation
because that's typically how it works But
[SPEAKER_01]: I got lucky and just hopped right into
flower Nice how do you how do you like the
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultivation space?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's what are some of the the things
that you like about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the things you don't
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: About it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like everybody has their their way
of viewing a cultivation job It can be
[SPEAKER_02]: very grueling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so I didn't I mean they did tell me
in my interview like hey, it's it's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of work It's like a farming job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I do it at home I'm ready to do it
for a career.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't realize they had 15 different
rooms and flower So Yeah, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work a lot of work I lost 20 pounds just
the first like two to three months working
[SPEAKER_01]: there just sweating and Busting ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally like feel like I'm running
with my head cut off there It's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: like best workouts for a job that I've had
I and I used to be a chef and same felt
[SPEAKER_02]: like the kitchen kept me fairly fit and
then yeah doing this is It's at least not
[SPEAKER_02]: making me Feel like I need to go to the
gym all the time where I'm like for sure
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling like I I feel like I'm sitting
around all the time or something like I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: moving all the time at work and Yes,
I come home like the different heat Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, just Yes, I don't want to do
anything after working Basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go hiking all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to hike like Six to eight miles
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like work is a lot so Yeah,
I didn't expect that I did not expect the
[SPEAKER_01]: grind I was definitely told in my
interview to expect it, but I did not so
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever wants to get in the commercial
field expect to bust ass and Sweat like a
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy person Yeah, I literally come out of
the rooms my hair is just Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets pretty crazy sometimes I feel like
also if you're just like doing some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: really repetitive tasks like moving plants
or like we use These cocoa pots that you
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrate so you have to like go in and you
have to break them up So the cocoa gets
[SPEAKER_02]: nice and fluffy after you hydrate it like
a pillow Pretty much but it like your
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulders and your back afterwards when
you're like over the trays because like
[SPEAKER_02]: some of our trays are pretty low to the
floor and in some of the low ceiling
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms, you don't sit in stools like Well,
so we sit on stools, but it's still like
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, like you're bending forward because
Yeah in the low ceiling rooms where we
[SPEAKER_02]: have the two-tier veg space That will
hydrate these pots on because we
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant directly into them out of the
clone room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I interrupt you real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tier are you talking about like stacking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like stacking okay, I guess like
like two two tiers where there's like
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights and then a tray and then lights
right below that tray and another tray
[SPEAKER_02]: below it You have three so yeah,
so it will two tiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have Two but it's it's in a room
that has I think they're Like eight and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half foot ceilings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's very limited space and so
we have like the the bottom tier is only
[SPEAKER_02]: about like You know that like five four or
five inches off the floor Wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like you're still in the stool,
but you're like kind of squatted in the
[SPEAKER_02]: school bent over Breaking up the cocoa pot
down then breaking up the cocoa pots after
[SPEAKER_02]: you do like a hundred or two hundred of
those your shoulders are just dying and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can really really be Tiresome and a huge
workout.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is super tiring Yeah But I mean as
you know, it's it's it's a grind and If
[SPEAKER_02]: people are looking to get into it,
it's something to really be aware of that
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in like I want to say like a
hydroponic grow where you're moving a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of plants around it can that can be
a lot of fast-paced movement and then if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in like a commercial grow that uses
organics and like let's say you're you're
[SPEAKER_02]: moving plants in to transplant into beds
or something or Let's say you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: using large seven to ten gallon pots For
the entire cycle and you have to move
[SPEAKER_02]: those pots Yeah, it's like, you know,
you're picking up 40 to 50 pound sacks of
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt basically each time because they're
usually semi saturated and and I can play
[SPEAKER_02]: now a lot of work Yeah, you know it's but
it's a lot of work for anybody that wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to get into it and it's oh, yeah It's good
to hear you reiterate that because it is
[SPEAKER_02]: it's but it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I feel like when you Time flies get
into a good routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah time flies and you get into a good
routine of it and you start to see all the
[SPEAKER_02]: improvements that are being made through
your attention to detail and the
[SPEAKER_02]: repetition of the different tasks as they
kind of day in and day out you start to
[SPEAKER_02]: find your groove and be more efficient at
different things and Definitely little
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiencies are really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could speak on that with using the
sprayer to spray your plants we use like a
[SPEAKER_01]: paint Sprayer and the hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Struggle with that hose every time it's
a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets caught on everything Then you have
to prime it so it can get loose and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a pain in the butt and I hate it but
my co-workers have taught me little like
[SPEAKER_01]: nicks and nags how to like tuck it in and
keep it away from the table so doesn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: caught and like kind of walk with it and
just a little tricks to like Make time
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient and not struggle with a
hose so much and do your job and get out
[SPEAKER_01]: of there quicker Because they expect us to
spray every room in 10 minutes or 10
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes per room it seems fast and I come
out of those rooms dripping sweat because
[SPEAKER_01]: of those hot suits and the mask and Yeah
spring when you're spraying prior like
[SPEAKER_02]: early flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hot and yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes And then when we do our l3 spray,
which is when we spray on the plants with
[SPEAKER_01]: the lights off We use this little like
green light and it's like on a timer so
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're in the middle of spraying the
green light will turn off and then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in a pitch-black room and you're in That
mask in the suit and you're trying to like
[SPEAKER_01]: not knock into stuff your phone But it's
it's fun I've I've definitely Got quicker
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to take 20 minutes per room now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down to 12 minutes a room I time
myself and I try to do different things to
[SPEAKER_01]: be faster and that's something I feel like
is important in the commercial industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: there you have to always look for ways
that are more efficient and faster and
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want you to push push push,
you know Yeah, absolutely, I mean it's um,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said earlier on it the pack prices
just keep on dropping and If they keep
[SPEAKER_02]: going down, but especially in Oregon the
cost of living keeps going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Organ kind of is terrible right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a little bit of a joke,
but your price per pound is sad Because
[SPEAKER_02]: our product keeps getting better and it
keeps going down in price It's frustrating
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's frustrating, you know cost of
living yeah, cost of living goes up and
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else keeps getting more
expensive But for some reason people want
[SPEAKER_02]: better cannabis for lower prices and yeah,
it's like one of those few commodity I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess a lot of commodities people want
like the best for less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but Everyone's looking for a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It then sucks to be yeah, even me when I
go shopping for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I don't blame you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely don't go for like the highest
price stuff anymore because I just can't
[SPEAKER_02]: afford it and Like I'll usually only ever
look for like concentrates every once in a
[SPEAKER_02]: while, but it Yeah, they're just really
expensive and I usually like to just price
[SPEAKER_02]: them out because I can compare them then
to what like we're producing at the the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that I work at and what they're
selling for and like it makes me think of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the Back in the days of like Ford
Motors when they first started they made
[SPEAKER_02]: cars that it was like one of his
Philosophies or whatever to make cars that
[SPEAKER_02]: were affordable enough for his employees
to purchase Which is a little funny
[SPEAKER_02]: because then it's kind of like it falls in
line with the saying of don't get high on
[SPEAKER_02]: your own supply Like he's just having his
employees pay the bills for their own
[SPEAKER_02]: salaries But you know, maybe that's a
conversation for a different podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Ford so For sure, I don't have a
Bronco and it was a it was a fun car,
[SPEAKER_02]: but fix fix or repair daily, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: F-O-R-D Fords aren't that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah No Well, so, uh, do you feel as
though in your home grow do you feel as
[SPEAKER_02]: though there's anything unique that you do
that you Have developed through your your
[SPEAKER_02]: few grows that you have done that you're
like this is something that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to do because I really like the
outcome of it regardless of what I've
[SPEAKER_02]: heard other people say or Even if you feel
as though it's just something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might have developed through your own
experiences So I really so this time in
[SPEAKER_01]: This grow it's kind of hard to see with
the bright light but in my hydro grow This
[SPEAKER_01]: is my fourth time growing in hydro and My
first time topping twice the other times I
[SPEAKER_01]: just topped the main stem once and that
was it and This time I top the main stem
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the sides so they could all catch
up together It was something I was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: nervous about doing when I first started
growing because it just feels weird to
[SPEAKER_01]: chop at your plant When you first start
growing it's like I don't want to touch
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, so when I learned
Commercially that it's fine to top your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant more than once or not even top a
plant because it's not catching up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: others I learned you can really you know
Change your yield that way and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: already seen it like all my tops are at
the third net pretty much In my other
[SPEAKER_01]: grows I noticed that a lot of my colas
didn't make it to the third net.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use three nets I was also taught
by my teacher Matt That using three nets
[SPEAKER_01]: is you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't use three nets, you're gonna
see a decrease in yield Is this in order
[SPEAKER_02]: to like Scrog and bring the branches out
to fill the canopy exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure if you're if you're
scrogging, that's Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the one to spread it out and then
two to capture all the branches as I grow
[SPEAKER_02]: up to make sure that you're supporting
them Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I I've now been Really trying
hard to get away with only two trellis
[SPEAKER_02]: nets at work, but we Don't do it like we
don't train the plants at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just let them grow Yeah, same with my
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the side branches kind of fill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah fill the canopy so usually the two
works on smaller plants, but then I Tend
[SPEAKER_02]: to need three on anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too big because it just You got to
get those tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't flop over exactly the flopping
over you do not want so that's why I was
[SPEAKER_01]: taught to always use three and I was also
taught to Wait to default at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: week five Just because okay the plants
need those lower leaves for mobile
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and to help photosynthesize For
sure, so what I used to do was wait till
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of week five and just default at
once but my mentor told Me what I could do
[SPEAKER_01]: is Wait till the end of week five take off
one or two leaves that are towards the top
[SPEAKER_01]: that are covering Colas and you just take
one or two leaves off every day to not
[SPEAKER_01]: have any stress to your plants because
defaulting all those leaves at once causes
[SPEAKER_01]: way too much stress and Sets back your
growth is what I was taught and So he said
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, just go ahead and Pick off one or
two leaves every day till the end of week
[SPEAKER_01]: seven and they should you should have all
the leaves off by then It's like almost a
[SPEAKER_01]: month of for sure defaulting one to two
leaves a day So I'm gonna try that this
[SPEAKER_02]: grow is in like one or two leaves per
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And you start from the top and go to
the bottom So I'm gonna try that this grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if I get a better response and
yield maybe What else I actually tried
[SPEAKER_01]: some crop steering at home Is something I
just learned recently from the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: field They push crop steering really hard
commercially and I've read that it helps
[SPEAKER_01]: yield as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been trying to learn different
techniques To do it here at home I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a sensor to tell me my dry
backs and whatnot But you can just feel
[SPEAKER_01]: your block and lift it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how dry you're getting So with this
grow I kind of did a crop steer kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: little run just to see In veg I did a
venerative is Isaac that venerative
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetative vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's vegetative and generative
Yes growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah in veg I did vegetative where my
EC Was low, but I had more runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watering more and then now that I'm
in flower I'm kind of letting the EC stack
[SPEAKER_01]: and I have it on irrigation Settings to
where they're going only getting like
[SPEAKER_01]: three to four shots right now Of water and
In veg I hand water so I have more of
[SPEAKER_01]: control to like water more and Get that
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a hard time saying that that
vegetative I can't say Vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah a vegetative steer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working on crop steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something new to me Something I'm
interested in learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's something valuable to learn in
the commercial field So I'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement it at home So I'm doing I'm
always doing different things every grow
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Yeah, I like to tell people that do want
to get into the commercial space to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: about what crop steering is and then I
always offer like reach out if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: questions because it is it is a
frustrating thing to learn especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have substrate monitoring
because when people say things like stack
[SPEAKER_02]: your EC in the substrate or lean towards a
vegetative steer or lean towards a
[SPEAKER_02]: generative steer or You know like do a do
a vegetative environment, but a generative
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation Those are things that when I
first heard about them, I didn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But then over time like yeah as you
learn about it you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so like you can you can call it like
Heavy stress versus low stress where heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: or heavy stress leans towards generative
and low stress leans towards vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: and Yeah, it and and then knowing how
there's irrigation practices that lean
[SPEAKER_02]: towards one where generative is like
higher EC's Larger drybacks vegetative is
[SPEAKER_02]: lower EC's lower drybacks or smaller
drybacks and then the environment where a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher Vapor pressure deficit is
generative and a lower vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: deficit is vegetative and then how you can
use both of those different things in
[SPEAKER_02]: combination with lighting and co2 and do
you do this at work I Do yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so Yeah, we have to in order to make sure
that we're getting the yields that we want
[SPEAKER_02]: out of each of the rooms But then to know
how to combine them is hard did you first
[SPEAKER_01]: start with your company like As a group
like for starting crop steering or was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they already did before you
worked there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the owner of the company had already
started implementing these practices he
[SPEAKER_02]: took over the company from his parents and
Started implementing a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: different technical practices that he had
learned with other grows and also he is
[SPEAKER_02]: just a a consumer of knowledge and a
retainer of knowledge and can usually
[SPEAKER_02]: Apply all that knowledge really accurately
and so we were able to use his experience
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as my experience and knowledge and
we kind of worked on it together and him
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a lot of this the Fiddling with
stuff in the backgrounds with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: hands-on and me doing most of the the
hands-on stuff and then using different
[SPEAKER_00]: did you guys run into any issues while
doing that or I Mean we've definitely seen
[SPEAKER_02]: how like large plants Or starting with
large plants and flower can be a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: in some cases because they just can kind
of get away from you if you if you If the
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate is is improperly sized Or your
irrigation practices aren't geared exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: towards Reducing the stretch and stuff
like that It I mean it's it's been a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: learning curve because We change a lot of
variables within the grow whether it be
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate or lighting or temperature
parameters or humidity parameters to try
[SPEAKER_02]: and just find little tweaks here and there
to to really perfect it and then Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been trying to also run more strains
per room rather than just doing mono crops
[SPEAKER_02]: because we only have all of our rooms are
like 12 light equivalents rooms and so we
[SPEAKER_02]: we only grow 108 plants per room where
it's like nine nine plants per light and
[SPEAKER_02]: it We tend to Like especially with the
changing market and we have we have a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: library where we keep like over 120
different cultivars on hand at any time
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll usually be flowering out
anywhere from like 10 to 15 different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars at any time amongst four rooms
and so like trying to keep all everything
[SPEAKER_02]: like within a balance is kind of what
we've been aiming for where we're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to find like general practices that can be
applied across a multitude of scenarios
[SPEAKER_02]: versus dialing in a recipe for a specific
cultivar in a specific room to to like
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect that cultivar like we want to we
want to get the the best iteration of it
[SPEAKER_02]: out of a general approach that allows for
the best possible outcomes without having
[SPEAKER_02]: to make too many fine adjustment tweaks
specific to a plant or specific to a room
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess because we then can take these
ideas and apply them outwards towards
[SPEAKER_02]: Helping other people with their grows
whether it be home grows or commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: grows I'm sure also helps with like
setting up a room and knowing which plants
[SPEAKER_01]: can you know be together for that for crop
steering to Yeah, but I know that also
[SPEAKER_01]: each table you can change to do use grow
use grow link No, we use open sprinkler
[SPEAKER_02]: for all of our irrigation and then Arroyo
for all of our monitoring and Those two
[SPEAKER_02]: and in conjunction with a we use one more
thing called grow trunnix But they're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually going out of business,
so we need to find a different application
[SPEAKER_01]: for that so I I'm assuming once you Figure
out like which plants need what when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're crop steering It'd be easier to set
up a whole room where you know every plant
[SPEAKER_01]: needs the same amount of shots and You're
not just like doing different shots per
[SPEAKER_01]: table And it's just like you know
everything's on the same route like
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're using the same irrigation
schedule per table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, so we do try to match Like
cultivars with like cultivars in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: if they are Leaning more on the like I
want to stretch and be big and bushy
[SPEAKER_02]: plants or if I'm short and squad and
Because we don't want to like shade out
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of the table with another half of the
table or something like that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then yeah the water consumption is
it's gonna be vastly different But I've
[SPEAKER_02]: I've run into new cultivars where I
haven't seen them grow before and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have the data on it So I'll just throw it
in there on a table with something else
[SPEAKER_02]: And just put like one light worth yeah,
just like nine plants and like right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm running sure cocktail number seven on
a table with our beach grapes number
[SPEAKER_02]: twelve that we hunted in house and the
sherbet cocktail number seven and beach
[SPEAKER_02]: grapes went in at the same time,
but the sherbet cocktail of course is
[SPEAKER_02]: three times the the height of the of the
beach grapes and I Because it was a new
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been steering that table with data
from the Sherb cocktail because I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to see how it responded to the irrigations
and stuff because I've already Seen the
[SPEAKER_02]: beach grapes and I can kind of gauge if
it's lean if it's going a little bit too
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative based on the leaf growth and
the the flower morphology or if it is
[SPEAKER_02]: leaning towards like a generative or if
it's kind of a nice mixed medium of the
[SPEAKER_02]: two and Oddly enough there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're roughly using about the same
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the beach grapes are getting just
slightly overwatered and leaning a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit vegetative, but it's it's surprising
to me that the biomass of the Sherb
[SPEAKER_02]: cocktail has got to be at least One and a
half times the beach grapes overall in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of like if I were to cut down both
plants wet right now I'd say the Sherb
[SPEAKER_02]: cocktails gonna be like one and a half
times the weight, but it's it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiring At one and a half times what
the beach grapes is which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating So that's something you do
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you match like cultivars with like
irrigations if that makes sense I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: ideally that would be where we try to
match cultivars on the same table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely and usually we do that
based off of structure because Like size
[SPEAKER_02]: plants usually use about the same amount
of water, but then there are plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are just not heavy drinkers they don't
assimilate the the nutrients as fast and
[SPEAKER_02]: so they don't need as much water and Maybe
their stomata like the density of their
[SPEAKER_02]: stomata on the leaves might be lesser or
something than the other plants where they
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't have the ability to transpire
as Greatly as some other plants do it
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me think of like Mac one Mac one is
a really slow grower It seems like I water
[SPEAKER_02]: her half as much as some of the other
plants that are moms Because we hand water
[SPEAKER_02]: all our moms so that we like pick up each
plant make sure that it gets a good dry
[SPEAKER_02]: back so that we don't not run it into any
like hypoxia related root issues where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just like Going anaerobic or
anything like that Yeah, there's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really fascinating to see how different
cultivars react differently and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: can then try to find matching Cultivars to
put together so that you can grow them
[SPEAKER_02]: under the same irrigation strategies and
in the same environment and that has been
[SPEAKER_02]: a huge Challenge and that's where it's
like we haven't really been we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: really been leaning towards making like
recipes for cultivars that I heard a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people would do with their irrigation
practices and environmental practices
[SPEAKER_02]: because Yeah in today's market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have so many flavors available
Yeah, that you can't really dedicate all
[SPEAKER_02]: of your space to like so we have four
flower rooms We can't just have four
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not It it doesn't really work
for us Even at like the lower the lower
[SPEAKER_02]: packs that we we produce, you know,
each harvest is only 30 to 36 pounds so
[SPEAKER_02]: But even amongst that like nobody wants 30
pounds of one strain in Oregon at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point of high quality weed because I think
everywhere they're gonna sell it for more
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's unfortunate because the
price keeps going down To the grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then the price in the dispensary is
consistent or goes up for some of the high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality like top shelf stuff and That's
it's a weird market right now for sure
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost like one of those things where
we just have to like hold on and hope that
[SPEAKER_02]: things adjust and Not necessarily like
improve as though like we know what that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be but it something needs to change
So, you know speaking of change Now that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've worked in the cannabis industry for
a little bit and you've been doing your
[SPEAKER_02]: homegrown And you've been an active
participant within the community posting
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram Looking at what other people
are doing interacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you go to since you're in
In like kind of an area where there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of cannabis events and stuff I don't
know if you're like attending any of these
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you went to MJ biz con this year
so like By immersing yourself more into
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry in the community Where do you
feel as though some changes could be Like
[SPEAKER_02]: what would you want to see change in the
community I guess and or the industry as a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole homegrown commercial anywhere in
between Well back when we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about remember I mentioned strawberry
cough and I thought it would be tall
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a sativa but I was gonna
mention is that because nowadays we only
[SPEAKER_01]: have polyhybrid strains and Nothing's
truly sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's truly indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just pretty much all hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to change that or Go back to like
Where you can just smoke straight indica
[SPEAKER_01]: or you know Get some straight sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think consumers Think still that they're
getting sativa and indica, but it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not Everything's hybrid and I think
there's there's not a lot of commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: producers that would want to grow a sativa
that takes 12 to 14 weeks to flower
[SPEAKER_02]: because That's almost two full flower
cycles of something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is more of a squatter Non-equatorial
so realistically indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so profit wise it's not smart to do
that You can't charge twice for a sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's one of The big the big things
because it does take about twice the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of input Makes sense, but I I hear
you because there are some people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: still doing it and they're you know,
they're just Making it a small a small
[SPEAKER_02]: part of their crop, but it's also one of
the reasons why I am so heavily advocate
[SPEAKER_02]: advocating for home grow is because
somebody at home can absolutely take their
[SPEAKER_02]: time to grow out something like Panama red
where they're gonna flower it for a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred and twelve 120 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like when I think a hundred and twenty
days in flower that is crazy I I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: keep Like for I feel like I will cut from
a mom Clone like take that clone it veg it
[SPEAKER_02]: flower it out and Like that whole cycle of
like even growing the mom to make that
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting altogether that doesn't take a
hundred and twenty days and But of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of it from a commercial
standpoint and from like a production
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint but for like the home grower
who wants Panama red like Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome Yeah, just more patience
Yeah, um But it sounds like you want more
[SPEAKER_02]: of that in the industry and in terms of
you want it to to be less of a poly hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: cesspool Because when I was a dispatcher I
like a black market Delivery company We
[SPEAKER_01]: would lie to customers the customers would
say oh I want og cush and We didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: that We were just like okay and just write
down og cush on the bag and then give them
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever You know and and a lot of
consumers think they're getting what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're ordering or they think they're
getting a straight Indica or straight
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa and that's just not how it is these
days and I didn't realize that until I
[SPEAKER_02]: became a grower Yep, so you when even when
you are like working through as
[SPEAKER_02]: dispatching for like this illicit service
You didn't realize at the time that it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't yeah that they weren't necessarily
being truthful about what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: providing for people Yeah, and I felt
awful lying to customers and telling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, you're getting Paris og That's
what you're getting, but and they asked me
[SPEAKER_01]: always a good And I'm just like sure you
know and I felt bad lying, but it's part
[SPEAKER_01]: of like their sales tactic and And even if
like we had a strain that said like Paris
[SPEAKER_01]: og and we ran out of that strain even
though it wasn't Paris og They would lie
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like oh, yeah We still have it and
then just grab another thing off the shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: and just package it and and I'm just I
don't know I think it's not fair to lie to
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers About what you're giving them
because some people look for something
[SPEAKER_01]: specific you know and some consumers want
that specific strain and that helped them
[SPEAKER_01]: in whatever moment that they were you know
dealing with and that helped them and
[SPEAKER_01]: People look for that you know and I feel
like nowadays It's all a lie Because like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not getting straight Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting straight sativa anymore
like That's that's not a thing anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I I dislike that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can agree with that I feel like truth
and marketing is something that needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a thing But like you said as a grower
to have to grow it for way longer because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a sativa and it kind of Ruins
production in a way or you know like just
[SPEAKER_01]: sets you back financially for people that
are trying to you know push their product
[SPEAKER_01]: off the shelf and they're having to Spend
more labor and time to grow something That
[SPEAKER_01]: takes longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally see why it you know the industry
only has poly hybrids But I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fair for consumers For sure I mean I
feel like there are some poly hybrids or
[SPEAKER_02]: other hybrid strains out there where they
do try to breed for the effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that would have been a
traditional sativa But to put it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that is a more squat easy To control
plant something that isn't going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: 120 days because even that alone It's a
very hard thing to do to to keep a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: alive that long especially through a
flowering period where you're You know
[SPEAKER_02]: after a certain time you don't want to
spray for pests and after a certain time
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah You know if you have too many
Temperature and humidity fluctuations
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with the flower structures of
some of these equatorial plants being so
[SPEAKER_02]: large You risk mold and you risk other
pathogen and and and rot and just a
[SPEAKER_02]: multitude You know nutrient deficiencies
other things as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when you grow something for that long
that is such a high-demand plant because
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis you know it just eats so much
compared to something like a cactus or a
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bonsai tree or something where you
can feed it once a year or something So I
[SPEAKER_02]: I do I do see you how like the poly
hybrids could become something where it is
[SPEAKER_02]: like It's almost like devious to tell
people it's a sativa when it's not but if
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where like a lot of these things
that are like Indica sativa High THC I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like a lot of it is like we just got
it wrong as an industry and we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably lean more towards a complete more
holistic understanding of how all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different constituents Come together,
and you know whether it be like an
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage Effect or however else people
would like to describe it and then also to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that every person's
endocannabinoid system is unique and
[SPEAKER_02]: different and so By finding something that
does work for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it could completely Like you
could completely find a terpene and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid profile now in something that
only takes nine weeks to grow And then
[SPEAKER_02]: find that same terpene and cannabinoid
profile in something that takes 12 weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow That's a that's completely
possible now with the genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have available, but It I feel like
as a grower you know that something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: a sativa or something that is like a an
equatorial land race Of some kind is
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to take a long time to grow and
as a grower you're looking at it and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying well Who's growing these long
sativas and where can I get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I feel like definitely for like a
home grower or just a consumer But just a
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer right someone's just like I just
want something that makes me you know feel
[SPEAKER_02]: productive or artistic or upbeat or like
want to go on a hike and they're like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a sativa or someone who's just Like
no, I just want to sit on the couch play
[SPEAKER_02]: video games get the munchies because I
need to eat because I haven't eaten all
[SPEAKER_02]: day Like and then they go and that's an
indica so I feel as though there's Just a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of different misconceptions in terms
of what sativa and indica are because like
[SPEAKER_02]: indica as an like as the term indica it
actually means of India and sativa Just as
[SPEAKER_02]: that as the term itself means Cultivated
so there's other plants that use these
[SPEAKER_02]: Monikers within their naming schema to
Designate that it is a cultivated plant or
[SPEAKER_02]: that it is a plant that has of Indian
descent Outside of cannabis and so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes where like yeah, and this is
sometimes where like a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_02]: like because of the illegality of Cannabis
at least this is my explanation because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the illegality of cannabis we have used
certain terminologies that are not
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate to other aspects of agriculture
and cannabis is so Truly related to
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture it it is agriculture in a
sense to use these Yeah, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: but to use these terminal these terms that
have a an agriculture Meaning to every
[SPEAKER_02]: other agricultural Industry in the world
and then are used differently in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: does tend to Confuse a lot of the the
public when it comes to consumers because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're given these different terms as
This is what this means.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what that means even if it was
something that was developed like in the
[SPEAKER_02]: shadows and in a in an illicit market in a
time where You know saying hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me get some of that really awesome
cannabis that puts me to sleep You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: no one's gonna listen to you and you say
that if you're like picking up a dime bag
[SPEAKER_02]: or a dub sack back You know 15 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I got it just like they do now
Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But yeah, I see how like a little bit
more like honesty and a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: Education yeah feels like yeah feels like
education is heavily needed not only for
[SPEAKER_02]: The producers and the purveyors of
cannabis but also for the consumers for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess when I worked in the being a
dispatcher That was like my number one
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always get from consumers lists
like oh, what's your best sativa?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your best indica?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like You know, so I think
people really need to educate Consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not like that and I didn't even
Realize indica meant from India and sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: was meant like Cultivated so that was
really cool that you taught me that Thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely I feel like it's
important for people to know that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: these terms are used outside of cannabis
and they're they're not Solely designated
[SPEAKER_02]: to the cannabis industry even though we've
appropriated them into something that they
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't originally which It's very
fascinating the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriates a lot of different things
that It may not be the best to appropriate
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I feel like a lot of a lot
of different groups and industries do that
[SPEAKER_02]: So considering that you started your
growing journey so recently I Feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: you're a great person to ask What were
some of the pitfalls that you found early
[SPEAKER_02]: on and growing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You were able to learn from That you would
want to then relay that information to
[SPEAKER_02]: another new grower Who's just getting into
it so that they can avoid it like so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can learn from your mistakes,
basically Don't buy co2 For a home grow
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure yeah tent for sure I mean my
teacher Matt he was like why aren't you
[SPEAKER_01]: using co2 and I'm like honestly Because it
was just expensive for me like if I could
[SPEAKER_01]: afford it I would do it But I really just
can't so it's if it's something you can
[SPEAKER_01]: afford do it, but it's not crucial What
else I think that a lot of people should
[SPEAKER_01]: try Rockwell grow a lot of people are
afraid To grow in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to a lot of soil growers Soil
growing is you know more common and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of soil growers have told me They're
afraid to grow in Rockwell, and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want issues problems, and it's funny
because I'm experiencing the opposite I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't experienced any issues or problems
in Rockwell, but I have seen some
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies and issues in soil so And I
think yeah, I think a lot of people should
[SPEAKER_01]: just try different ways of growing Not
just be stuck to one thing Expand your
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and learn different ways of how
do you get better and For me I watch
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube videos every day of how to grow
and different stages and what to do and I
[SPEAKER_01]: watch a lot of Drying and curing videos
just because I want to perfect that stage
[SPEAKER_01]: I think drying and curing is the most
important step of growing a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: might say otherwise, but I Mean you can
grow a beautiful flower and then dry it
[SPEAKER_01]: and cure it terribly and then it ends up
being a mid instead of you know Top-shelf,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that sucks because you put in
all this hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I grew this shit beautifully It's
gonna be perfect, and then when you dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and cure it you're like what the heck So
yeah my first dry I experienced that Hey
[SPEAKER_01]: smell And I was petrified and thought you
know my harvest was ruined, but luckily
[SPEAKER_01]: like it went away So I mean it was okay I
Feel like I'm still learning how to
[SPEAKER_01]: properly dry and cure I had mentioned to
you that I threw my trim in the freezer
[SPEAKER_01]: with popcorn nugs and I checked on it like
a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe almost two months later just to make
some edibles make cannabis butter out of
[SPEAKER_01]: and I saw the popcorn nugs in there,
and they were looking beautiful And I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like ooh, so I went to go pick them up to
see if they like crumbled and they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: they were perfect They were still kind of
sticky too So I don't know it got me on an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of like can I cure this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know I mean sure I might just
try one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think low temp curing is a thing yeah
Yeah, I mean I liked how it looked the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower tasted better the color was still
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like the trichomes Were still
you know intact like like when I compared
[SPEAKER_01]: my dried cured to like what I did in jars
to the freezer Cure it just looked so much
[SPEAKER_01]: different smelled different The freezer
cure was better So I am a little nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a little nervous to you know
cure in the freezer, but I'm gonna try Not
[SPEAKER_01]: my whole harvest, but I'm gonna try like a
jar or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do and you're gonna
and just so like the listeners know but
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it sounds like your plan is to dry it
fully Yes, put it in a jar and seal it in
[SPEAKER_02]: that jar Yes at room temperature and then
put that sealed jar in the freezer Yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then when you want to check on it your
your plan is to then pull it out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer Let it sit at room temp Until it
comes to room temperature and then open
[SPEAKER_02]: the jar to test to test the buds just to
avoid any sort of Condensation or moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: that could form on the flower itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I try I think it's a great idea
because I've heard of other people saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that they'll store Cannabis that they want
to come back to Long-term either in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fridge or you know I feel like I might
have even heard it in the freezer before
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was one of those things that I was
like well I'm not gonna be trying that
[SPEAKER_02]: because anytime I did grow at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was I Couldn't couldn't keep the flower
around long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I wanted to smoke it all I Feel
like those are all great little tidbits of
[SPEAKER_01]: advice for new growers Yeah, what do you
think you think I should just try it and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what happens I'm a little nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you should I think you
should try it that method Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: drying it for a week in the tent Try to do
my 6060.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe put like one really nice flower in
there, you know And then the rest just
[SPEAKER_02]: popcorn nugs or stuff that you wouldn't
mind making into edibles Like you're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about just because that way it's
not necessarily a huge loss to lose one
[SPEAKER_02]: one nice bud But that you can see how that
one nice bud turns out But yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely suggest, you know getting it
fully dried all the way to where like you
[SPEAKER_02]: could smoke it If you wanted to but you
want to cure it to help reduce a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of the harshness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the enzymatic process continue So
yeah, I'd say I'd say try it why not I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean all these things that we experiment
with as home growers that That can be
[SPEAKER_02]: documented and relayed to other home
growers if it is helpful then why not
[SPEAKER_02]: especially You know, it makes me think of
like if somebody can only grow one crop a
[SPEAKER_02]: year outdoor But they want it to stay
fresh because they really like fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: flower versus something that's been cured
at a higher temperature for a longer
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time because even some people
like that sort of peppery cannabis where
[SPEAKER_02]: everything off gases other than the
cariophylline where it's like just really
[SPEAKER_02]: peppery and spicy But I know some people
like that especially in like hashes and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff But if somebody wanted fresh
flowering they were able to take all this
[SPEAKER_02]: out outdoor that they grow and dry it up
really nice and then Trim it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: manicure it to what they like and then get
it into some airtight container that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can then freeze And then pull as they need
to throughout the year to supply what
[SPEAKER_02]: their needs are I feel like You know
somebody can easily grow what they need in
[SPEAKER_02]: a year in an outdoor plot if they have the
ability for it And it's a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might it might be a great way for
people to Keep flower around for longer
[SPEAKER_02]: and enjoy fresh cannabis throughout the
year So I'm sure that there's a niche
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity there for other people to
learn from this and to apply it in
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways Keep a good log of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I tried googling it and there's not
much on Google about it I saw a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: like reddit comments on it and other
people have tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say use a frost free freezer I've
even came across people drying in a fridge
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to do like what makes the best
cure Because I noticed like I told you
[SPEAKER_01]: when I looked at my cured buds in the
mason jars And then I looked at the cured
[SPEAKER_01]: bud from the freezer The color was better
the taste the smell was better from the
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like I guess it's more fresh
like you're saying so Yeah, I mean Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes off gas so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah even at lower temperatures,
there's some that will just off gas over
[SPEAKER_02]: time and So like it seems like the only
way to combat that is completely limiting
[SPEAKER_02]: light exposure completely or Reducing the
temperature significantly Reducing the
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another thing too You know if
you keep it in a sealed jar through the
[SPEAKER_02]: ends of A lot of the oxygen is going to be
used up and so you won't even have like an
[SPEAKER_02]: oxidative factor on the on the terpenes
after a certain amount of time if it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like cured properly in the jar and you
like Just got it to that last point where
[SPEAKER_02]: it was still just like that last One or
two percent of curing and just throw it
[SPEAKER_02]: right into the freezer at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it would work perfectly So
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you know, it seems like from
what I've gathered so far from our
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation some of the stuff that You do
is you you try new stuff out and you try
[SPEAKER_02]: to remember what works and what doesn't
work Yeah, and then you try to say how can
[SPEAKER_02]: I apply what works and then how can I
understand how it works?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like those aspects for a grower
are so important because they allow for A
[SPEAKER_02]: more thorough understanding of the
processes of growing and curing and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the different aspects of what cultivating
and producing cannabis entail and Like if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're always trying to improve those
things and glean the best practices out
[SPEAKER_02]: off of them it helps Just in so many
different ways and it really like I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like the culmination of knowledge and
information as as the as a cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: journey continues can You can like really
make these leaps and bounds in the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of what's being produced that I feel like
a lot of people go how did you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how did you get this good so fast or
something?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like just repetition Applying what
works and removing what doesn't it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's not I Don't I don't mean to
oversimplify it but there are some aspects
[SPEAKER_02]: of it that can be really simplified down
to use what works remove what doesn't Work
[SPEAKER_02]: take time and have patience and you'll
learn from it Change is is good a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers get stuck in their you know
routine and how they do things and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what works but I think if you're
open to change and Open to learning
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways then you're gonna be the
best grower out there because You're not
[SPEAKER_01]: just stuck in being stubborn and like oh,
this is right like there's no really right
[SPEAKER_01]: and wrong way like you Can evolve and
change and get better every time?
[SPEAKER_02]: There there are so many times where people
have asked me how how did you grow that
[SPEAKER_02]: flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when they've seen something on my
Instagram or something and I'll say I do
[SPEAKER_02]: it this way and they'll say oh You know,
I've never never wanted to try hydroponics
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've been growing in living soil
for 20 years And I've been happy with the
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I grow like the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go well Just because you've been doing
something for 30 years doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: Mean that you've been doing it correctly
or that That you can't learn anything else
[SPEAKER_02]: like it it does sometimes that fixed
mindset does hinder a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: growers I feel like So it's good to always
be learning and always be trying new
[SPEAKER_02]: things and applying those those lessons
learned from trying out new things Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and definitely I think that's great advice
growers need to reach out and get help and
[SPEAKER_01]: and not be prideful And be like oh like
this is how I learned and this is how I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking to it like no like ask for help
That's how you can learn and and get
[SPEAKER_02]: better Absolutely Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this has been a wonderful
Conversation and interview and those are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually all the main questions that I
have but I do always wrap up the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: with a couple of the Kind of ubiquitous
questions just that I feel like every
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis podcast needs to ask so Since we
didn't touch on this earlier on in the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first cannabis smoking
experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: For your first one that you remember my
first one was with my sister She gave me a
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe and I smoked out of it I didn't know
to use like the carb part so I didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was doing Okay, I just inhaled and
you know, I didn't really feel high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I did it right but I just
started smoking with friends in high
[SPEAKER_01]: school and Learning different ways to
smoke and how to like create things to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke with like I even smoked out of a
pizza by Cutting through the crust all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way and you pack the end of the crust and
then you hit the other side It's weird,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know like fun ways to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it out of a strawberry out of a
potato You know made your own bong out of
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a water bottle with a pencil But
my funniest smoking Memory would be I was
[SPEAKER_01]: at Sunset Cliffs a really famous place in
San Diego for great views So I'd always go
[SPEAKER_01]: there to smoke It's by the beach and Me
and my friends hot box my car And I get a
[SPEAKER_01]: knock on my window and sure enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cop and I'm like Fuck and it's
literally like Cheech and Chong movie like
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to roll roll down my window and the
smoke just like Flew on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and I was just like, oh no,
I'm fucked and he's like, oh, what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just chillin And he's like, oh it sure
smells like it and then he just said like
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys could just stay here Get you
know, let it wear off Wait for an hour and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can go home I was like,
oh, thank god.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was lucky for that I've heard I've
heard a few stories like that where they
[SPEAKER_02]: the cops just were like Just don't leave
for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly one of you didn't smoke and
they're sober and can drive get nice about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, cuz I feel like it's since it
is just like a Decriminalized thing now,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in California where you're only
gonna get a fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have to they know like Well at
the time it was illegal like when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was 16, it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oh Yeah Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's definitely a fun a funny
story and one that I would have just been
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of Yeah, I would have been shitting
bricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been quite nerve-wracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing I did was grab my keys on the
ignition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw it I was like, oh my god,
I'm not gonna get a DUI for smoking I was
[SPEAKER_02]: petrified but we we used to put our keys
in the gas cap If we'd hotbox our cars,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we'd like take them out pop the gas cap
put them in there because then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the car smart and I know my one
buddy got rolled up on one time and Same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like hotboxing rolled down the
window smoke poured out and the cops like
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you guys planning on driving and
they're like no we were just using this to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke an officer and he's like,
well, how do I know that show me your keys
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like They're in the gas tank
and or in the gas cap and the cop was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, that's pretty smart It's just
like I can't believe that that worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously he could have he could
have made up the story But that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: one that I heard every time I heard that I
was like, oh put it put it in the gas cap
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever play like where they called
it baseball where you had to smoke and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you pass it to your friend And you
have to go in a circle and then then you
[SPEAKER_02]: can exhale When you get it back You know,
I feel like potentially at one at one
[SPEAKER_02]: point when I was younger we did something
like that I feel like it was always just
[SPEAKER_02]: like puff puff pass and you'd hold it in
as long as you could anyways because
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it was like seven or eight of you
sharing one joint or one blunt and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna You know, you only are gonna get
three maybe four hits off of it before
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gone So you really would try to
conserve and and get the best effects
[SPEAKER_02]: possible out of it Yeah But yeah,
that's that's a those are funny stories So
[SPEAKER_02]: just a couple more of these questions here
then so who's or what is your favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be one that you've grown that
you really enjoy growing or one that
[SPEAKER_02]: You've smoked that is just like your
favorite smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really love any og Strains especially
the original strains back in the day like
[SPEAKER_01]: we spoke about Finding those good oldie
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Skywalker og Paris og King Louie I
even like blue dream sour diesel The old
[SPEAKER_01]: strains Okay, let's go from like ten years
ago or so exactly I wish they would bring
[SPEAKER_01]: those back to more in the industry And for
growing I really enjoy growing green
[SPEAKER_01]: cracks It's what I'm going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a resilient strain It isn't stress
out ever you can top the crap out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's still gonna grow super tall and
It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It drinks a lot So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful It's fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Remember living in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to Sacramento State many years
ago and At the time medical like 215 was
[SPEAKER_02]: available and so I had my medical card and
there was this dispensary that had green
[SPEAKER_02]: crack and it was Like it seemed like there
was more trichomes than weed or then like
[SPEAKER_02]: actual flour Whenever we would get it and
it was it was crazy and I look back on it
[SPEAKER_02]: now now that I've grown for as long as I
have and I'm Almost positive that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were dumping like all the different keefs
that they would get from their different
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmers onto the bags of green crack
because it was the most expensive one that
[SPEAKER_02]: they were selling and it was you know,
they were like claiming 40% THC or
[SPEAKER_02]: something and this was back in like 2009
and so I always like think back on that
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like this is Yeah, they definitely
were doing something to it But I really
[SPEAKER_02]: liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say it worked really well as
medicine It's the first plant that started
[SPEAKER_01]: getting super frosty right away before the
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Well, maybe it does just look like that
I've never actually seen it grown because
[SPEAKER_02]: it was one of those ones that was it
wasn't available in the commercial market
[SPEAKER_01]: when I started Can you see good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the light is the light too bright?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little It's a little choppy,
but the overall canopy looks great Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the one the tall ones in the back or
the green crack and they're just loving it
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell anybody to go to At autumn
grows dro on Instagram and you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: updated pictures of her grow and the the
green crack and the other Strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_02]: and other things that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And I'll just tell them to go there
to see it because it's gonna look a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: better Yeah, especially if you're
listening on Spotify or Apple podcasts and
[SPEAKER_02]: you aren't seeing any of the video
recording But if you are go over to
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube and listen up there on our
premieres So just one more question
[SPEAKER_02]: actually So favorite strain currently
sounds like it's green crack but if you've
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've kind of gained an appreciation
for a specific breeder Since you've
[SPEAKER_02]: started growing Who would you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently say is your favorite breeder if
you had to choose one I'm gonna go with
[SPEAKER_01]: jungle boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, they're my favorite They're
basically all I smoke when I do go buy
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and wax I really like 710 labs
though for some concentrates And yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to shout out my mentor Matt Brett
He's taught me everything I know and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing and he'll help you guys Grow and
he'll answer any questions you have Nice
[SPEAKER_02]: and do you know his Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: Off the top of your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's cannabis science underscore
underscore on Instagram and then he has a
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel Just cannabis science on
YouTube cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the that about wraps us up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So autumn again Thank you so much for
joining me today for this conversation and
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of help Shed a little bit more
light on the different growing out methods
[SPEAKER_02]: that you use and your growing journey so
far You know, I feel like when people hear
[SPEAKER_02]: that new growers are getting this much
success in a home grow and being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it with You know financial restrictions
and working around those to still make it
[SPEAKER_02]: work Is it I feel like it makes a lot more
home growers hopeful about being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: do this and find success in it so that
they can either grow their own medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: start a new hobby or even use it as a way
to pivot into the the cultivation space
[SPEAKER_02]: professionally, so like you exemplify a
lot of those different aspects and So
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, thank you again so much for joining
me and I really appreciate you being here
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me Yeah, absolutely All
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everybody You You
