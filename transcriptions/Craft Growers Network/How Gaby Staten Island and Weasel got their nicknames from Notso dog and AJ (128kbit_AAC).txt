[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have to leave soon and I want
to Get one topic out before you do so it
[SPEAKER_01]: might sound like it's a little
off-subject, but you gave me the nickname
[SPEAKER_01]: Staten Island Yeah I gotta let you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not very happy about that
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I ever grew weed was in
Brooklyn, okay, okay, so Let's just rewind
[SPEAKER_00]: a second when you're telling canna stories
because I do a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes difficult to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not that you want to lie,
but you're talking essentially about
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal shit You you might not How do I
put this the right way a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_00]: not want to be public figures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right you don't they don't want their name
out there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to out your friend if they
want to have privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have moved on They might have a
different I don't blame you for giving me
[SPEAKER_01]: a nickname, but Staten Island You know
Like the first thing that came to your
[SPEAKER_00]: head at the moment when you were talking I
actually if you really want to blame
[SPEAKER_00]: almost said his name if you really want to
blame it who I got it from Was when skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: VA was talking to the podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: About his story and he kept saying my
buddy from Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right I'm gonna blame him and then I
mean we can mutually him and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: mutually share blame for popularizing You
know And all that but it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's a It you know, I you're just
trying to talk about people and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times like, you know You stop because
you're so used to saying someone's name
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to protect someone's privacy
and maybe they don't want their real name
[SPEAKER_00]: out there or whatever, you know,
so they you know, they So yeah My point in
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing this up my point in bringing this
up is the weasel first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll have to talk about how he got that
nickname because that Might and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty shitty too, but he's the real
Staten Island He lived there before I
[SPEAKER_01]: lived there he lived there after I lived
there he was the he was the man on Staten
[SPEAKER_00]: Island Hold on let me ask these other two
dudes a question cosmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys know what AJ's real nickname
was?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about nicknames is that most of
the time you don't pick them yourself They
[SPEAKER_00]: are put on you by people in your circle or
your friend group.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm talking about,
bro You put this nickname on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we were good
[SPEAKER_00]: People probably don't think it means
asshole Joe, but it does it means asshole
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my defense Gabby Right when I was
starting to talk about you you had been
[SPEAKER_00]: retired from growing for some time You
were a legitimate business store,
[SPEAKER_00]: but business store owner You know what I'm
saying and like this stuff was long in
[SPEAKER_00]: your past and I didn't call you up and be
like Do you mind if I out you on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet for doing a whole bunch of like
shady ass illegal shit a long time ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just avoided all that by like
talking about you with a name that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: traced back to you now that you've decided
to say your name and show your face you're
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck with it, but You know, that's kind
of that's kind of how it went I'm sure for
[SPEAKER_00]: did I keep wanted to say his real name I'm
sure skunk VA thought the same thing When
[SPEAKER_00]: he was trying to figure out how to talk
about you five six years ago on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast Right without just saying,
you know, oh, you know and that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind I don't I don't mind that I
got a nickname I just mind the nickname
[SPEAKER_01]: But like what it actually is and the fact
