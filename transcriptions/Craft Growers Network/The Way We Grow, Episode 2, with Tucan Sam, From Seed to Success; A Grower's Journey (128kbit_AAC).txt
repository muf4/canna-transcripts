[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the way we grow
podcast Where we have interviews with
[SPEAKER_00]: people about their cannabis story their
journey with cannabis and what led them to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation So today we have two
cans Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a home grower a seed tester He's also
a phenohunter and above all else.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a family man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And So Sam, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's great to have you So what's new
in your grow world like what have what
[SPEAKER_00]: have you been doing lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been perhaps?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's easy you've been popping what have
you been testing lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently I've been going down a cap junkie
wormhole so it's been a lot of cap junkie
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses and What I'm trying to do is find
something that I like and F to it And just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of breed it out that way more for
curiosity sake You know, I'm just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: going off the cuff but You know what I'm
doing right now and just kind of still
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunting and testing different things
but right now it's mostly like a cap
[SPEAKER_01]: junkie got a few mac crosses in there,
so Pretty much going on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like nice Have you ran like
just the straight cap junkie before I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't I've always had the flower one of
my buddies who kind of put me on to
[SPEAKER_01]: growing he used to grow it a lot so I
Would pick it up from him and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal I've grown out Different
different crosses from it and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always been something that I've kind
of liked so my buddy flamethrower hooked
[SPEAKER_01]: me up with some Maybe like a hundred or so
beans So I've been running through some
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been nice That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is is is that his like genetics label or
flamethrower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one of my pals on it
Instagram should check him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does a lot of different work,
but he knew that was kind of what it was
[SPEAKER_01]: up my alley He was like, you know,
try this I'm not into it, but I know you
[SPEAKER_01]: are and I ran a couple alone Then I ran a
couple more and then so wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might you might actually been right
buddy So are they all are they all female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they fems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they no?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Looking through the males to
chopping down a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But um every once in a while Every one in
five or ten you find that nice one that
[SPEAKER_01]: you just have to keep around and do
something with So what makes it nice for
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know once I figure out that it's a
male just that it goes through a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: abuse, you know I might I might throw it
out of the tent for a couple days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I might not water it with the
rest You know, I might skip a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: waterings just to really beat it up you
know just to if it bounces back and just
[SPEAKER_01]: Still the top of the tent that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's something I you know
want to want to stick around with
[SPEAKER_01]: structure wise it can stand up on its own
Stem rub and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I don't know if that's That's
everything, you know a lot of is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different opinions on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mostly go just on structure How
vigorous it is how much abuse it can take,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure I mean those are like pretty much
the exact same things that I look for in a
[SPEAKER_00]: male like just stress testing It making
sure that it doesn't throw a bunch of nuts
[SPEAKER_00]: like while it's in veg You know the
structure on it like keeping the keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant like upright without having to
put any support on it while it's growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for you know Months and months in the same
small one gallon or two gallon pot And
[SPEAKER_00]: like having the ability to do like
multiple prunings on it without it causing
[SPEAKER_00]: too much stress for it to throw a bunch of
nuts either like yeah, I think that You're
[SPEAKER_01]: spot on with a lot of those and the last
thing is when you flower it some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones they might look good and then you
flowered and it's just like not not nutsy,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, you know, it's not too many so
they're You know, you want them you want
[SPEAKER_01]: them clustered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks tight like a flower structure is
you know, like in a for the female,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you go through a lot of
males you feel bad tossing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Has to be done Yeah, no, I mean I feel
Like you probably go through more females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like sometimes the the males you're
just kind of like you either just are
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping a bunch of them around Right,
or you just like toss them all right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe keep one That's how it has to be or
you're gonna end up with a male factory
[SPEAKER_01]: real pollen is gonna be everywhere It's
gonna be a as a roster Jeff says gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: a Maury povich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the daddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want you don't want that
None and then you you start to get good at
[SPEAKER_00]: like just noticing the structure of the
plant and the leaf morphology and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor and stuff and you're just like I can
pick them out, you know pretty early just
[SPEAKER_00]: to at least give it a potential try
because I feel like unless you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something where you're introducing like
ethylene to the the flowering cycle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: male and trying to promote some sort of
like trichome production or Other like XX
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic productions like with
calyxes or bracts at the inner nodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff then you're you're not really gonna
know the the full like potential for it
[SPEAKER_00]: when it is introduced to Like a female
population and what they're like progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna bring to the table until you do
the whole process and sometimes that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just It's tedious hundred percent man
shots of the guys who are doing that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're way smarter than me Just
keeping it simple, you know, yeah What's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's some of the favorite things that
you've created?
[SPEAKER_00]: Together then grown out and found
something that you were like, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's really cool Like you I
didn't think that that would even come
[SPEAKER_00]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um a few meat breath crosses One of the
ones a white truffle with meat breath,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the problem is if I get a herm
every now and then I'm not too angry about
[SPEAKER_01]: it and in fact like it in the right spot I
could be juiced, you know, I might really
[SPEAKER_01]: fit like oh nice, you know I might get a
little But I know people don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certain things that I if I notice it
starts to harm Frequently, I'll I'll mix
[SPEAKER_01]: it and some of the white truffle Crosses
that I did early on a really good You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but like I said there were herm
stuff and then I'd grow some of the herm
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's also really good one time it
hermed onto a Mac and I grew the cross and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was phenomenal white truffle Mac cuz
you know Mac When you try on your own,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll it'll deny you right off the bat,
you know, you failed pollinations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Sometimes with a herm, it just does
its thing and you get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like wow, that's really weird,
you know So that's really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there's anything to that
genetically because it's I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac was considered like a triploid where
it doesn't have it's not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to accept pollen so dude like I want
I wonder if there is some potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: like if If you get a herm pollen,
right then you're getting an XX chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: in the pollen and I wonder if there's
anything to that that's that allows it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter it like I don't know Again,
like like you said that's for smarter
[SPEAKER_00]: people to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know how that could be but
it's interesting and there's got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: something there, you know, like Yeah,
like nature happens but for the most part
[SPEAKER_00]: you can usually be able to like if if you
know all the You know the the modes of
[SPEAKER_00]: action and how everything is interacting
then you can usually be like, oh this
[SPEAKER_00]: causes this causes this causes this but I
Don't know what this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really fascinating though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I I definitely think that's um,
you know, it'll probably be discovered,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in the future as it gets more
legalized and More research is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know big ag starts jumping in more and
more so And big egg has some big money for
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding and genetics So sure,
that's that's a huge potential and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that's gonna be part of it locking
down things and you know Keeping it for
[SPEAKER_01]: prior proprietary and whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a great point Alright,
so I'm gonna jump into a couple questions
[SPEAKER_00]: just to keep the the flow of this going
the way I want but so What's what was your
[SPEAKER_00]: first experience growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any type of plant not necessarily
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my first experience was it was
actually a cactus a pencil cactus From my
[SPEAKER_01]: grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a big green thumb Tried to pass it
to my mom and I just remember her coming
[SPEAKER_01]: over for Christmas or whatever and she
would go on a rampage, you know in her
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican accent about how You know,
my mom would be killing plants and she's
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing this and doing that how terrible and
then so finally my grandma comes to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: she's like Well, all you have to do is
like alright, so I start taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: this little cactus one day and next thing
You know, it's a big bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, wow, you know water it literally
she had waters What what was grandma's
[SPEAKER_01]: advice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Water it, you know, she did she was
old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's always collecting eggshells and
Orange peels and I always used to think
[SPEAKER_01]: grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on that really you putting that in
the plants like You know, it doesn't do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything but she was convinced,
you know, she knew she knew her stuff But
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, she put orange peels egg shells in
the top like crush them up and just put it
[SPEAKER_01]: leave them at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So It's it's a trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still use now, you know, I still use my
banana peels and my egg shells So but to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer your question, it was a pencil
cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool Do do you use those in
like the form of like a worm bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or composting now or do you just use them
as like a top dress for your like?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the egg shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just I'll roast them in the air fryer
for probably about 20 minutes crush them
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the blender and then I'll add those
to my soil bins Okay, that's basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just cooking waiting waiting to be
mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sprinkle on top I have like a power
drill and I just you know mix it in real
[SPEAKER_01]: good With the banana peels I roast Those
but that's more used for top dress and
[SPEAKER_01]: teas Okay Pretty big on using teas and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean like let's so let's kind of
get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what is your grow style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a synganic grower for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doc keeping it simple Get your dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's renewable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're eating bananas eggs all the time so
Using that type of stuff But always having
[SPEAKER_01]: those or I always keep some jacks,
you know keeps them With a botanic hair on
[SPEAKER_01]: on tap just in case something hits the
fan, you know, maybe every two to three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks You throw in a little fertilizer in
there just to juice things up a little not
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you're sure Not even if it is
showing deficiency per se but if it is for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure but even if it's been like wow,
it's only It's been a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me let me top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me throw some fertilizer in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a treat, you know So but when
you say that are you like adding both like
[SPEAKER_00]: organic top dressings as well as then like
watering in the the fertilizers to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like bridge the gap before the Organics
become available or like what is your
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I top dress Maybe once a month Okay,
so that's on schedule no matter if it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer Or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting that top dress just to keep
that soil Well when it's in the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: tent, I'm giving it a flower girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the flower bloom Formula is that a
dry amendment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool I have that mixed with roasted banana
peels and I just kind of add that every
[SPEAKER_01]: month and Keep keep things going but daily
I use teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have The air bubblers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I stick them into one gallon
jugs four gallons for my Flower tent every
[SPEAKER_01]: other day is what I have it down to So how
long do you broom for?
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I just stick the little nozzle in
there add the teas on top, you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: little sugar Depending on I have I use the
clear jugs for flour and the Their white
[SPEAKER_01]: my boys drink a lot of milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like white jugs For sure for
the ones that are green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that's green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting Stuff in the white anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just flour only it's gonna be
mostly water aerated water a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: banana peel But mostly just that water
It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so that's how I just keep them
rolling bubble them and then set it and
[SPEAKER_01]: forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Excuse me And I think that's the thing
about organics that uh You know it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you that Things can work behind the
scenes, you know, you get those microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it sit for 24 hours You know,
it's working that whole 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just doing your regular life come
back water and it seems uh Seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be doing all right nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean all your flowers on Instagram are
great and For all listeners, I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely have Two cans Sam's Instagram
in the description, but it's at two cans
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two can underscore Sam something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right So with with your grow set up do
you I if I remember correctly you were
[SPEAKER_00]: using both like a HPS and LED in one tent
set up to time to get like the different
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpene expressions from the different
Wavelengths like the different light
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, is that still what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely I want to explain your like
philosophy behind that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Practical for one you might say one
practical I Grow in a basement,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the gross space is like the
afterthought of my house You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else was put in nice and like
all right, where can I put a tent?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, there's a spot in the Boiler
room that's been cold and forgotten about
[SPEAKER_01]: you know here you can have this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's cold down there In the winter
you need that HPS, you know where that
[SPEAKER_01]: thing's not on it's 60 degrees down there
as soon as it cranks up the veg tent
[SPEAKER_01]: starts heating up everything starts
heating up so I have a four by four and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a 600 watt HPS and a Mars Hydro SP
3000 it's like a 300 watt bar So it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a little overpowered light for
the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, it's It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think sick is the 600 watt
dimmable No, no, okay, but the Mars Hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: you can dim it is dimmable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is dimmable I keep them both on
full blast, you know, I'm not a type of
[SPEAKER_01]: guy, you know PB whatever light blast PPFD
people sometimes try to stay within a
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of let it rip 100% you know
all the time and the plants kind of get
[SPEAKER_01]: used to it, you know I feel like if you're
consistently one way the plants will just
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust and or they won't you know,
you have those strains that are just like
[SPEAKER_01]: Roasted and occasionally I'll post in the
roasted tops You know, but everything
[SPEAKER_01]: under those roasted tops are gonna be like
Rock hard you could beat someone with the
[SPEAKER_01]: nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be so thick even in the like
commercial space will sometimes say You
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you sacrifice a couple of those
very tippy tops everything below it is and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything below it is perfect Then it's
like well your that means you're maxing
[SPEAKER_00]: out the PPFD across most of the canopy And
if you have a couple of hot spots,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's one It's probably better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably like the overall yield is
gonna be better because if you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: Like extremely hot spots that means that
there's definitely gonna be parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy that are below the ideal level as
well Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not pushing it to that limit Yeah
So and and it correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you kind of do like a perpetual flower
Yes, so like you you're never really
[SPEAKER_00]: shutting it down Unless you unless you do
and you pull things out and clean it or I
[SPEAKER_01]: only yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know as I clean it every three months
or what would be great, but Typically that
[SPEAKER_01]: thing only gets emptied when it's
catastrophic failure involved something
[SPEAKER_01]: Goes something goes haywire and I have to
take everything out or whatever else
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's probably about You know,
I don't want to get too detailed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a decent amount of plants in
there Every every Monday I try to clip two
[SPEAKER_01]: to three plants so it's constantly Trying
to overfill the space, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it a make and I also run a lot of
regular seed regular seeds from testers
[SPEAKER_01]: and things so it's constantly not wanting
to give too much light to Unproven like
[SPEAKER_01]: because it could be a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put them on front street
So it's constantly managing like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what needs the light and what
doesn't?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a labor of love, you know,
you I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's like it's like therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yoga So I totally feel that I look I
did definitely love it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like It's it's kind of being Zen
being in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah What so Just because this is where my
mind always goes to when I hear perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: growing What is your what are your like
IPM practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Yeah, because for me that was like
it's one of the biggest things at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial space where having a
perpetual grow like say in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have Let's say five or six rows
and you're like swapping one row out every
[SPEAKER_00]: ten or fourteen days so you're like
harvesting one and moving one in and Like
[SPEAKER_00]: that I always am like how if you are
spraying, how are you not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: overdrift if you're not spraying?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you like are you running
beneficials or Sorry, I'm rambling,
[SPEAKER_00]: but please let's explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like your philosophy I Think that is
the Achilles heel of the perpetual grow My
[SPEAKER_01]: dad is always telling me shut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on You got it because he runs
segments and everything else so it that is
[SPEAKER_01]: the Achilles heel and it did take me a
while to figure out but It's two things
[SPEAKER_01]: it's you can either It's like it's like a
steel fortress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create that steel fortress if
something gets in God help you You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you just keep a steel fortress,
then nothing can get in and for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I did But as any grower you
get caught you get clones you have buddies
[SPEAKER_01]: who want to send you these things and Lo
and behold, I got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got thrips You know, it was hell,
you know, I didn't know what to have
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus now fungus ass is the only thing
that I still haven't defeated those
[SPEAKER_01]: bastards once in a while you you'll see
them floating around but IPM I've started
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and I've defeated all those So to
speak haven't seen anything haven't seen
[SPEAKER_01]: any signs in Probably about a year and a
half But you know, it's about spraying
[SPEAKER_01]: every every other watering I'm spraying I
spray the base like the the soil level I
[SPEAKER_01]: get the basically just good and I skirt
the plant so that first Three four inches
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant is just all stem So I spray
the base and the stem and that's where I
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on and that's how I can spray in
flour and whatever else because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying straight to the base of the plant
What do you spraying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use dr. Bronner's the peppermint the oil
I use that mix with a lost coast Okay And
[SPEAKER_01]: that also the the final Ising on the cake
is the alcohol level if there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: going on I may not add alcohol But if
they're fungus gnats popping up then I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: put a little Alcohol in there to spice it
up for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay And have you um, hmm, have you ever
tried nematodes I Have yeah, I've tried
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes it helps don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does help But man these fungus gnats,
I don't know what I have I must have the
[SPEAKER_01]: African fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hunt us You know did they did defeat
anything I've literally you know done the
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes The dirt the DE I have mosquito
bits at every that's what I find is most
[SPEAKER_01]: effective mosquito bits nematodes It's
just you know, Sam tried play sand it you
[SPEAKER_01]: need everything you literally need to
Combo punch them to slow them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing that it's like they
just don't go away because I have so much
[SPEAKER_01]: organic soil It's always has to be
somewhat wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never just say you know what bone
dry everything because then for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: things Will get real unhappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using plastic pots or fabric pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use fabric pots and that's another You
know, so it's it's keeping everything
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat moist because now I don't want to
get hydrophobic and then everything's a
[SPEAKER_01]: mess so That is the that is my everyone
has their cross to bear and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be worse than fungus gnats You
know, I got stickies everywhere and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just what you got to do more stickies,
you know More mosquito bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know Their harm was relatively
they're just annoying and they ruin
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important thing Getting
them out of the fucking buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know what a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's really that's at the
worst of times now It's just one in a
[SPEAKER_00]: while once a while I fly around so for
sure I mean like smoking outdoor you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna not only be smoking some fungus
gnats and some some bugs Oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're also smoking dust and dirt and
Anything else that was kicked up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got spiders thinking it's that's
their hangout spot All kinds of a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: spider silk spiderweb all over your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So, um, I guess yeah a couple of
fungus gnats aren't the worst thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't I would say protein but we're not
eating it Study for another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe maybe you'll see the impacts
of fungus that combustion That's funny my
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures you always see a fresh fresh
yellow tapes around just to uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are good at catching them
But it's also good at finding out when
[SPEAKER_01]: things are really kicking around,
you know For sure and also if you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with fungus gnats and or root
aphids They look like the flyers can look
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar if you're just catching them
out of the corner of your eye But if you
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like have them on the on the sticky
trap, then you can definitely identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the two So it's uh,
yeah, I think that sticky traps are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: clutch not only for catching them but for
identifying for sure Yeah, definitely So
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned earlier that your dad,
you know was giving you some suggestions
[SPEAKER_00]: on being like hey clean out the tent clean
out the tent because and it sounds like he
[SPEAKER_00]: might grow as well, so I I want to steer
the conversation just back a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like So who did you learn to grow
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah funny funny enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: He Never told me that he grew He was
always a stickler about me not smoking so
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically his rationale was he wanted
me to find my own path.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want me to be swayed by anything
that he did or whatever else so He but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, he's an old-school type of grower,
you know He's not caring about you made
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, he's He's gotten more into
it since I've gotten Into it and I've kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of re-inspired him to get his tent going
again, but he told me stories about having
[SPEAKER_01]: tents when I was in high school I'm like
dude, there's no way he's like I'll show
[SPEAKER_01]: you and he brought me back and then he
Opened this little closet that I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: because he's an avid gunsman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a gun safe Frickin tent
that he had, you know, that's so funny oil
[SPEAKER_01]: papered out and he's like you never
smelled anything, you know I'm like dude
[SPEAKER_01]: if I would have smelled something I would
have thought it was me and I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: lost my head and I would have started
cleaning up and you know telling what I
[SPEAKER_01]: would have done that's so funny,
you know, so yeah, he grew a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: but That's so funny because when I was
growing up my parents had this like shop
[SPEAKER_00]: shed like kind of like a lean-to shed with
like the Clear corrugated plastic on one
[SPEAKER_00]: side, but it was like that opaque Green
stuff that was kind of ubiquitous for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while back in like the 90s and And my
brother and I weren't allowed in there But
[SPEAKER_00]: every summer we always said that the
skunks got really bad because living in
[SPEAKER_00]: California at the time You know,
we would we would just Scott skunks all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time But especially in spring because
that's like when they're mating and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot you get like so many skunk smells
But then like in summer We would get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of skunk smells right near the house and
my parents would always be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh be careful if you go out side watch for
skunks so you don't get sprayed and And
[SPEAKER_00]: then after a while they told me that they
were they had like a little tiny grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it was like just like a little
greenhouse mini grow that was just enough
[SPEAKER_00]: for my dad because he had he was using it
for like essential tremor and stuff and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like After I learned that I was like
what the fuck I had no idea I just thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had skunks all the time and I was
like just you know, of course young and
[SPEAKER_00]: naive No, that's that's funny,
man That's how that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't you don't question it until
you get older Maybe or they tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: something they could tell you anything Yep
But so if since your dad didn't tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: but was growing so who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you kind of like get your
inspiration to start growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it sounds like you you started
with a cactus and where did it go to from
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It started for the cactus and then it was
going on eBay For trying to buy cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds on eBay, you know secret codes it
was like it was written in like certain
[SPEAKER_01]: descriptions and so I bought some white
widow quote-unquote seeds and I was in an
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment at the time So I'm like,
alright I'll just grow it veggie inside
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I'll throw it outside and in a
flower and I'll worry about it then but I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to worry about the smell until
flower Yeah, so I hooked up a little setup
[SPEAKER_01]: in my in my office desk and I'm vegging it
out and things just start stinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know next thing I know the whole I'm
like, wait, is that me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, no, it's just I'm just
being paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my it really smells like how is this
possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I know things can smell and veg
but um, so that was kind of my first You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, just just curiosity, you know,
just wanting to grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I grown other like potted
plants, but Not really cared for something
[SPEAKER_01]: typically with a potted plant you water it
when you remember and it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah You know nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great, but to like have an
attachment to like oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important Can't screw this up
can't screw this up Yeah, it was that desk
[SPEAKER_01]: white widow, you know, I ended up throwing
it outside Got way too smelly way too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I had to start growing tomatoes to
mask the herbs that I had going On so I
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing tomatoes in front of it
and it was just the whole thing And and
[SPEAKER_01]: this was just at some apartment in New
York in Queens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah my first apartment So my landlord
he's you know, he's a nice Jewish man But
[SPEAKER_01]: he definitely wouldn't be down with any
any no type of type of funny business like
[SPEAKER_01]: that So that's why I had to grow the
garden and wow, what a nice garden like
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So he was right there like he saw he
saw the Tomatoes growing at least he saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the tomatoes growing and then I had to
make a cage because the buds just would
[SPEAKER_01]: not stay down So I just had to tie them
down, but you know at all costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh and they're like almost making like a
Scrog to keep it lower to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean from what I've heard that some
of the first uses of like Scrogging for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor plants is just to keep them below
the fence line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah, and it was it worked wonders,
you know, I couldn't believe how well it
[SPEAKER_01]: was going That's crazy kind of really just
got me going but obviously that first ago
[SPEAKER_01]: is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man that's going back maybe Eight nine
years of at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so it was a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that your landlord didn't know I
I'm not sure you know, I took a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: great Pains too, but you know when you
like you think about things and you think
[SPEAKER_01]: back on it Like there's no way that smell,
you know, it was and then once I clipped
[SPEAKER_01]: it It's like alright, where do I he might
have just thought I just was smoky at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know Maybe he didn't think it
was growing but he knew something was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on because Now once I once I clipped
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't put it anywhere It's just like
the smell just kept getting worse and
[SPEAKER_01]: worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you try it like in the
apartment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I First attempted to dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a grill at the time and you know
under the grill There's like that little
[SPEAKER_01]: space sure I made like a little in the in
the thick of the night I went out and made
[SPEAKER_01]: like a fishing line and I hung it up and I
did this whole setup But eventually I
[SPEAKER_01]: said, all right, this is not working and I
made edibles with it Okay, brought it
[SPEAKER_01]: inside and I just started cooking it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, I just got to cook
this up and It was smelly man Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was it was it was a it was definitely a
rough You know a rough week and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: Experimenting but it was a good
experience, you know in the end it now I
[SPEAKER_01]: look back on it how silly I was but I
wasn't on Instagram then You know kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't I thought Instagram was for
kids back then, you know, I'm a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: school guy Instagram please, you know,
so it was a whole new world once I started
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, you know, it was like
literally, you know The lights turned on
[SPEAKER_01]: like holy I've been doing this in the dark
the whole time literally just feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this seems right All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I got to Instagram, I realized all
the things I did wrong, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so It was a pretty good experience
learning, you know just on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to make mistakes and do stupid
things, but you know, I Mean that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: such a great story though for like a first
time grow like not only Like you were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to even get it successfully harvested but
then just you know I feel like it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those lessons that so many growers
now are like I people like me and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: even like yourself if people have asked
you for help You're telling them make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have a good drying space Yeah,
and don't don't wait until you harvest to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out where you're gonna dry your bud
or how you're gonna dry it It's not sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a sexy answer, you know,
it's not and it's the most important part
[SPEAKER_00]: like exactly you can take mediocrely grown
weed and Give it a really nice dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: cure and have it be something that you're
proud to smoke and share But you can also
[SPEAKER_00]: have a stellar grow like, you know,
no no bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No molds Everything's frosted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you you made it grow just the
way you wanted it and then you put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and throw it on idea condition
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yeah, you're gonna you're gonna suffer
the consequences unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: but So so like when when was your first
successful harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you you know, you took everything
all the way to flower Harvested it dried
[SPEAKER_00]: it cured it and then you know consumed
That was my the first harvest I ever did
[SPEAKER_01]: was an outdoor when I first got My first
got my house Okay, so the first thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: did before the house, you know just as the
house was set up I got the backyard got a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse from Amazon threw a greenhouse
up and that was that That was soup to
[SPEAKER_01]: nuts, you know, and that was I was getting
seeds off of I think seeds men,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'd upgraded from Amazon to the
great seeds men or What are the funky
[SPEAKER_01]: things that they have crop seeds calm or?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the websites that come with the
grow guides and all the colorful All you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do is this I I didn't know about
white label or this and that I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I grew some auto flower Whatever
and it was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was okay it had all the names that were
appropriate, you know the OG whatever but
[SPEAKER_01]: I know now that It was just white label
You know But it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually was able to and I had a lot of
it I was able to parlay that into my
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Went online and I looked for different
ads that people selling stuff and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey listen you want to trade for
some some bud and I actually Built my
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor setup through you know How many
times did it take you to get to To
[SPEAKER_00]: building up your your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh What do you mean Well, so like were you
able to to trade enough from one harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: to get your girl started?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow I was able enough to trade it was
one summers basically like a summer's
[SPEAKER_01]: worth of work For sure, and I just had so
much I never expect, you know I never were
[SPEAKER_01]: this with the auto flowers or these were
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were photo periods It was a mix But
all grown in like five gallon pots outside
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this greenhouse greenhouse,
yeah Some will greet some in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse some I grew, you know,
just uncovered along the side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I think you know, I was kind of crazy I
I just moved in my house and I started
[SPEAKER_01]: this someone asked me like aren't you
didn't you ease into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you got to let them know what to
expect from day one, baby You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know you set the expectations at X
and it's all down from here You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you don't want to start my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only one plant He's gonna grow it's
like I sure what let's let us know who we
[SPEAKER_01]: have from Jump Street There are some
skunks shouldering a lot of heavy load in
[SPEAKER_01]: my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny Yeah, the heavy load of the
blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah but um you so it I mean It sounds
like you were a consumer far before you
[SPEAKER_00]: were a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and definitely and so like What was
your first experience smoking then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um that was with my buddies back in high
school we had this buddy, you know We all
[SPEAKER_01]: had I went to a private school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of my buddies had real strict
parents But one of my buddies who drove He
[SPEAKER_01]: his dad would work late on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every Monday night it became like a
tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd meet up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd sneak out of the house by any,
you know means necessary and I think this
[SPEAKER_01]: was maybe senior year of high school and
Every Monday man, we just smoke bud and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good time and always look forward
to Mondays everyone bitching about Mondays
[SPEAKER_01]: We could not wait for Mondays to roll
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only guy to do was go to school and
soon we'd be high That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how it started for us
and then so like what like with your first
[SPEAKER_00]: grow where you went to get those white
widow seeds What inspired you to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like was it just something where you
wanted to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you you were like, well, I know that
this flower comes from some plants So I
[SPEAKER_00]: might as well figure out what that plants
about or did somebody like did you see
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody growing and be like, oh shit I
can do this myself for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I Inspired you in the midst of
buying one time Not now at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Wall Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm meeting with all kinds of different
guys Now these are guys in suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me when the guys in a suit when
you're in a suit It's just a level at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I thought of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a level of Expertise, you know
privilege this that you wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking weed you would grow weed So one
time I'm this executive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, you guys are young come check
this out pulls us over to one of his
[SPEAKER_01]: closets We were in the midst of buying
weed and he found he got he caught wind of
[SPEAKER_01]: it And he's like, oh you want to buy some
weed, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out opens up a just the most
innocent looking closet and Blinding light
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally what what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it was just a closet full of
lights and at the bottom of these little
[SPEAKER_01]: little plants I'm like What like what is
he's like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm gonna grow this and this is what
it's gonna turn Into and then he shows me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm like wait you grows again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why why not, you know, and So that's one,
you know, I always knew as soon as I got
[SPEAKER_01]: my house I want to try it I want to do it
and at that time the prices were this was
[SPEAKER_01]: right before New York went legal Okay,
so the prices were through the roof we
[SPEAKER_01]: were paying those and you know,
it was either I was gonna grow and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way or You know, I was gonna have to
stop Smoking as much, you know something
[SPEAKER_01]: was gonna have to give and so I decided to
you know, give it a hack What were you
[SPEAKER_00]: paying at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man Breathe 400 for an ounce 500 for now,
you know when you start feeling fancy want
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff that breaks apart when you see
like some of the prices for an ounce I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: almost embarrassed like wait that can't be
real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was real like, you know, what were the
names you were paying?
[SPEAKER_01]: for because I feel like the runs,
you know, you were going after the the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies whatever all the fake Mylar's were
so I man those Mylar's we'd get so many of
[SPEAKER_01]: those little blue cookie Mylar's and Gary
Payton's and You know, like bring me all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But um, it was just a lot of names,
you know Whatever, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: discriminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted it all, you know, I didn't run
into one batch that I didn't like so Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I just you know, and I guess I'm
lucky in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't some people don't like Girl Scout
cookies Oh, it makes me feel a certain way
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know that to me is is terrible,
you know imagine You know, that's so
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's I smoke it and it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I that's such a nice great too
Yeah, you know, I think everything is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like Yeah, yes, you have
preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, it's like what
sex is bad sex Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just the one that I'm not
having, you know, that's that's the real
[SPEAKER_00]: answer I Can dig that answer yeah,
you know, so that's funny But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree I feel like sometimes it's
like the the bandwagon effect almost for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the hatred that some of these
different strains get and whatnot and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't I don't know if it's if it's
warranted, you know, like based on the the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual flower itself, I think it's more
about like the the culture and and what
[SPEAKER_00]: what specific people are saying about it
and You know what in group they're part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being like yeah F this or F that or
we give our seal of approval to this or to
[SPEAKER_01]: that and Yeah, because like as a grower,
you know, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: factors that come into it like oh you
didn't like that Oh, well, how was it
[SPEAKER_01]: grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: When was it pulled?
[SPEAKER_01]: When was it it's like you huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the normal approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that sucks You know, was it too,
you know, you have more questions because
[SPEAKER_01]: anything could have happened to that
particular batch Was it a female thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what cut was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know fucking cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just you know, dude It could even
come down to like which one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies rolled the blunt and was it
rolled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correctly or did it fucking run and you
were just like this is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even get high Like yeah cookies
sucks, it doesn't even burn right It
[SPEAKER_00]: always wets the tip of the joint that
cookies Yeah, why the fuck is my joint
[SPEAKER_00]: always what when I'm smoking cookies with
so-and-so it's uh, it's the corners for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure crook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That's funny that's funny and this is
Miss associating who's to blame?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Well, um So so throughout your your
growing experiences What was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: times where you look back at and it was
like one of your biggest learning
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be due to like like let's maybe
ask it in two in two ways So like what was
[SPEAKER_00]: your biggest learning experience due to a
setback?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was your biggest learning
experience due to success?
[SPEAKER_01]: Biggest learning experience due to a
setback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that would be Letting in the bugs That
was my own fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you just don't know,
you know, I I took in clones from outside
[SPEAKER_01]: Like of you know for friends or whatever,
but I also literally took in clones from
[SPEAKER_01]: outside I took in clones from my
greenhouse And I thought what I know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I know now was not a thorough IPM at the
time I'm like, oh, there's no way a bug
[SPEAKER_01]: could last through this it's cold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm splashing on the thing You know,
it's like did you put oil did you sulfur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you oh you just ran water over it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh great, you know, so getting spider
mites Defeating those things it was tough
[SPEAKER_01]: because perpetual I think I got it and
then it would sneak around somehow and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: find them again so that was and I I Threw
I lost cuts, you know, I that was a big
[SPEAKER_01]: one That was my first like, you know,
you think the world is gonna end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh My girl, it's ruined finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's I've seen a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I was I was I was really
You know, I'm not to say I was gonna stop
[SPEAKER_01]: growing but I was really demoralized Yeah
point over spider mites, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about it now like who cares about
spider, you know, just yes It's no big
[SPEAKER_00]: deal spray them, you know, yeah That's
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what like a bad infestation will do
to the the more the morale of a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't know if you've ever dealt
with rude aphids before but man No,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh it is it is just so depressing to deal
with because like not only do they just
[SPEAKER_00]: make a mess because they they grow and
repopulate so fast and like they like
[SPEAKER_00]: stain all your trays and You gotta like it
takes like multiple cleaning cycles to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the stains removed from there just dead
dead bodies and you got to wash the trays
[SPEAKER_00]: down every day if you don't want it to
build up and they like they can sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: become I Don't know the term but they'll
basically go from just being something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the in the soil To where they'll
they'll climb up into the canopy and start
[SPEAKER_00]: to repopulate there as well So you start
to just have like actual aphid problems
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like you got honeydew on all
your leaves and on some of your buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll like crawl into the nooks and
crannies and it's they are and and They're
[SPEAKER_00]: so hard to get rid of because they'll like
they burrow way and like like fungus nets
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they're just once you have
them like it's almost like impossible to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely eradicate them and so yeah,
I've If you haven't dealt with rude aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the listeners and for you as well
Sam I would never wish that on my worst
[SPEAKER_00]: enemy it is by far my least favorite Pest
to deal with that or thrips because thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: can just if you have like hop slate and
fire it or something and in And if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like at a low Threshold of pressure it'll
it'll explode the pressure and like no
[SPEAKER_01]: time flat Yeah, I think I think everyone
should have an experience with Pest Jim
[SPEAKER_01]: just just to give you that You know that
chink in your armor just to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: that tool in your belt It does make you
more resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I remember at the time I
thought that I wore that as a badge of
[SPEAKER_01]: honor I've never had any bugs Like it was
saying, you know, like yeah, you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been growing that long pal So,
you know and if you say my new spot has
[SPEAKER_00]: never had bugs and it's been that way for
five years Then I'm gonna be like damn
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you have really good IPM practice,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you've learned you burned and you
implemented, you know not not to say
[SPEAKER_01]: You've never experienced like all right,
just if anything hits you it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: topple you like bricks Yeah, cuz if you
know because like there's such a huge like
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of weapons in your arsenal for IPM
That but they all have like different
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted approaches and different targeted
applications Sure, if you don't if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know You know, it's I don't have a
good analogy for it, but like when using
[SPEAKER_01]: the oil you can't use The oil with certain
sprays or you'll burn the hell out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, you know, no oil together Yep,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm dipping them in sulfur and then
spraying them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's you know, and then if you if you do
get a new product, right it it shows you
[SPEAKER_00]: like application per acre in a lot of
cases and you're looking at that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: direction be like how that what what is an
what how do I Convert tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the acre to tent conversion ratio?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it doesn't when you rub
your chin two times you say I guess I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: use a little bit Hopefully it works but
then even even they're like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've listened to any of the stuff by
like Suzanne Wainwright Evans,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like the bug lady on Instagram and
she's been on like the the kiss organics
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast a few times and she Has I like
through listening to her I've heard you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like you have to there's there's a
reason why things have certain application
[SPEAKER_00]: rates because if you go over then in some
cases it might not work and then if you go
[SPEAKER_00]: under in a lot of cases it won't work and
And then if you if you're also going over
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're gonna have like the
phytotoxicity Potentials within the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: where they'll just burn and melt and turn
into you know a brown spotty mess of
[SPEAKER_00]: Decaying plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, and and you got to get it like
just right just so it like is just enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to affect the the target pest but not
enough to burn the plant and not too
[SPEAKER_00]: little to not do anything and just waste
products so that's I It is unfortunate
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of the most effective products
only have these sort of like industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications in their in their like how
they perceive their usage is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, and I'm sure once they're you know,
once they're marketing for a legal product
[SPEAKER_01]: and not a quote-unquote illegal You know
then they'll make a lot more sense for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to do it for a pot get a five gallon
size as opposed to all right do this per
[SPEAKER_01]: half acre and you know It'll make more
sense right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I guess it's in limbo land or
whatever But and certain companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it, but they're they're also the
ones gouging you probably the most at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point the ones that it's a risk and Any
kind of product I already know is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: charging you a nice premium Exactly,
and that's that's also I feel like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: such a an issue because there's so many
things out there especially when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to like fertilizers or you know pesticides
or herbicides or even like Just like in
[SPEAKER_00]: different like environmental control
equipment that are used in different
[SPEAKER_00]: industries and all have like pretty cheap
versions that are still of decently high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality like Fertilizers comes to mind
with that where you know like buying a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled fertilizer that has water mixed
into it You know, you're you're paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: like the shipping cost of that water and
you're paying for the branding and the
[SPEAKER_00]: logo that has you know the different
cannabis related Scheme to it and It you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get like the same thing at any like
major ag supply in a 50 pound bag that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna last you probably your entire life
if you're just a home grower and It's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, the 50 pound bag cost the same as
the one quart bottle At the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally insane You know,
but you live and you learn and hey It
[SPEAKER_01]: ain't tricking if you got it, you know if
you want to do it all simple and easy and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's you know It's it's cost-effective for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it's cool, you know makes
sense But when you're doing it always all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time perpetual Three years from now,
you know, you're still gonna be growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you start to think all right
Why don't I get the biggest size they have
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't I go right to the factory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the ingredients, you know,
it makes more sense from that some people
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess get into it and They don't know if
they're gonna be doing it in six months,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so they just kind of buy the
bottle I've been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I started with you know,
the Fox farm Yeah, that was it you know
[SPEAKER_01]: buying bottles and bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this Jax?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one of the guys that I learned from
these jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this Jax?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot cheaper Wow, it's the last me a
long time, you know So so who did teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you like kind of like your cannabis
growing style or like where did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I develop that from it was remember I
always I had a version to Instagram I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what I thought at the time,
but I just I don't know so I ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: joining Facebook and I started like
joining one of these groups and gentlemen
[SPEAKER_01]: That live near me near near the house that
I'm in now he was growing and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: selling also so He you know, I would buy I
would invite him over I'd buy some We'd
[SPEAKER_01]: sample He'd look at my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd give me some tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you should do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got really good son All right,
do this and so I take those advice leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: stripping all that stuff You know and then
I did he's like do you should really get
[SPEAKER_01]: on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I hate to try to bust your
tops here But you should really think
[SPEAKER_01]: about a reconsider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know I don't know but
finally I did and just that in person
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at things plus learning online It
was like You know just lighter fluid to
[SPEAKER_01]: the fire, you know, it was a burning
desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to learn But it was you know,
it was limited by knowledge by this by
[SPEAKER_01]: that but once I don't know I could even
use the internet so many different things
[SPEAKER_01]: I could learn but it's like Instagram just
turned the lights on and made me realize
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many people out here growing,
you know, it was like it was incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: when I because he thought it's just me
It's just a couple guys, you know And so
[SPEAKER_01]: once you realize that it's a whole nation
of people out there growing together and
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when my progress just You know
skyrocketed That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah the dude Francis right on You
know, I hope he's well, he's a wild guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I hope he's still doing well Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if Francis listens to this then he
knows he knows he helped inspire you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely Yeah, it's it's so crazy
because yeah I feel like it was like the
[SPEAKER_00]: secret grow club forever until like as
soon as you get introduced to one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: larger communities like the Instagram
community or Even like the different
[SPEAKER_00]: reddit communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's a like just so many
more people grow and then you even
[SPEAKER_00]: expected and It's that's that's definitely
I feel like the shared information is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely the biggest learning curve that
I've had as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah That's awesome So before we
we had done the like what was your biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: learning experience from a setback so what
would be your biggest learning experience
[SPEAKER_01]: from a success I Would say maybe making my
own seeds Doing the STS reversals learning
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between an ST STS
pollination and a regular male pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: My first pollination was with a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what you know,
I kind of had based I didn't did my
[SPEAKER_01]: research and I whatever else So I kind of
you know, I did the whole thing and I
[SPEAKER_01]: reversed a couple plants and you know I
was like, alright, you know, this is some
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen But man, it's it's not as much as I
thought it would be you know I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: these things would and then I started
working with males And how much pollen the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in amount pollen they were
kicking off and different things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just creating, you know Looking at
different mothers and the value of a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenol hunt you know, they're not They're
not giving you 10 seeds or 15 seeds just
[SPEAKER_01]: because they want you to have 15 keepers
You know, you got to sift through and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know find that one that really speaks to
you, you know, so I think Just breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: and making your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you Can pop all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me pop 20 today, you know,
let me pop 25 today, you know and be real
[SPEAKER_01]: specific about who I keep Just having that
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think You know it It affects you
differently than when you're counting to
[SPEAKER_01]: like art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just paid 200 bucks for these 10 seeds
All right, that's 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when looks all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't waste these, you know,
I can't call them I just spent 20 bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: for this seed, you know, so It's different
when it's like I'd have hundreds of them
[SPEAKER_00]: throw a handful in and let's see what
happens Yeah, the value of seeds changes
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do your first pollination because
you have like You you sift through them
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like, this is more seeds off of
this tiny little plant than I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased in my entire life And and
they're worth how much it just it's a kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a glass shattering moment so like Are
you then?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounded like before, you know,
you were counting this Counting the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: as each one being worth is a certain
amount based on like how it divided out
[SPEAKER_00]: based on how much you spent per pack
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would I would assume then that you
were only popping a couple at a time Sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very you know, and everything was a
keeper like if it grew slough.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right Well, I'm gonna grow it slow,
you know, it's wonky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm growing a wonky plant then you
know, I'm taking it whatever I pop I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how stubborn I am sometimes Do
you do you still?
[SPEAKER_00]: only pop one or two out of a pack if you
purchase it or get it as a testing or
[SPEAKER_01]: something or do you just know I I It
depends on if I have just one pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll at least try to pop half of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay You know, I'm going to if it's
regular seeds I'm putting two and one cup
[SPEAKER_01]: just fight it out and see who grows better
if it's a lot You know, sometimes I put
[SPEAKER_01]: three in one cup if I'm really feeling
frisky like all right, I'm gonna be strict
[SPEAKER_01]: today, right, you know So it gives you
that more population listen to the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: like a CSI and how much numbers they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like cheese I got to get my numbers
up, you know I I want to see more of what
[SPEAKER_01]: different things have to offer and you can
see it in real time the first time you do
[SPEAKER_01]: it It'll show you like wow It is something
in doing ten females as opposed to all
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my best two females You don't
know when you have tens like I can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: see where the lines going here It's like
all right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is on the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're down here and you're on the other
end for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of nice yeah, I I Think the
first time I I popped seeds I only popped
[SPEAKER_00]: like one or two out of a pack and it it
was just so like I Was almost disappointed
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was just like this like neither
of these are showing me what I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were supposed to show based on
the photos that the breeders are providing
[SPEAKER_00]: and You realize after you know after I did
a little research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, so there's this thing
called pheno hunting and the phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the plant is gonna change
based on like not only the parameters of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow but also like what the genetic
makeup of it is and each seed is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: different and You look at that and you go
hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well human beings are pretty unique and
different and It seems like cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty similar with having a male and a
female provide the the the donation for
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics and I Guess you're gonna just
have to search through a lot So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where I I just started popping all the
seeds from every pack is I was like I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like if I keep if I keep one or two
around still Then like if those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers and I don't find it in the first
batch and I spent all that time When I
[SPEAKER_00]: could have just had a couple more plants
shoved into the space, you know You might
[SPEAKER_01]: be you might be onto something with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've uh, you know, I have a bit of hoarder
in my nature So I have to fight that
[SPEAKER_01]: instinct all the time to I keep those keep
those little behind just in case Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it feels like the the logic behind
keeping it is what if those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers, you know and by that logic at the
same time it almost makes more sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt them all because if you're If you're
if you're looking for the keeper then the
[SPEAKER_00]: then the goal would be to just to find it
as soon as possible and I since you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been a tester and a fino hunter and you've
also made your own seeds and then hunted
[SPEAKER_00]: through them afterwards, you know,
the the time and effort it takes just to
[SPEAKER_00]: go from let's just say selecting a mother
and a father plant or a mother and a donor
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and then Finding something that
you're proud to say was a keeper of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire process is you know, that's a year
or more Oh, and it it always makes me not
[SPEAKER_01]: makes me laugh It always makes me like
like whoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow when these guys are you know,
there's certain years different folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll pump them out You know and you
know like wait like I guess if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the right just a huge facility and number
I guess it could be but Obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nowhere near that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like it just Logically like you
grow it you select it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes time Everything is months
not like all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's months, you know, you'll know if it's
something All right, get back with me next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll uh, we'll see, you know,
yep And I'm not sure about you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I always flower out cuttings of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never flower out the seed plant itself
just because yeah, because if if if there
[SPEAKER_00]: is any potential in the genetics to have
any sort of Different in morphology after
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain period in its life based on the
the hormonal Kind of buildup then I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be as close to what I could then put
into production I can be for the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: search.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm like hunting just from from seed
and I've Experienced this and heard this
[SPEAKER_00]: from other people, you know, like you may
or may not have some sort of intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits show or the morphology as well is
going to be you know, it's more like that
[SPEAKER_00]: bifurcated morphology where as the plant
grows it it produces two sets of Auxiliary
[SPEAKER_00]: branches per per node set versus if you're
growing like a clone, you know you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the Epi form of like having one
come after another on the stock and and
[SPEAKER_00]: that also then affects the flower
structure because like as I'm sure you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen from a seed plant if you just grow it
and flower at that top nug is also you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it has the the two nodes per per
nodal spacing and It those tops can get
[SPEAKER_00]: huge and then if you grow out the clone
all of a sudden even if you don't top it
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like well this flower structure is
Completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's got a bit more of a fox tail
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peak on it is taller and the side
Auxiliary buds are like smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't they're not as compacted or
maybe they're even better, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that's kind of where I've I've
leaned towards just only flowering out
[SPEAKER_00]: clones rather than seed plants I'll keep
the seed plant around for longer as a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother as long as I'm up potting it but
then you know, eventually it just it never
[SPEAKER_00]: makes It to flower Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting for sure Yeah,
no, I um, I do know what you mean about
[SPEAKER_01]: that top cola how it's you know,
it's always super heavy when it's from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed always got to make sure those suckers
are near fans because All too much you you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, especially that late summer run next
thing You know, you're cracking it open
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's bad news bears, you know,
yeah, like wait, that was the main that
[SPEAKER_01]: was the main Main feast right there,
you know, you're looking at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if it's like a small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah That was like a quarter
of my weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So, yeah, I'm getting better with my
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows I'll maybe start running some
clones more frequently What's your cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: method?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I use cups like the I have a clone
dome and a mat but I Inside that dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them in like a rooting plug and
I'll use like a fast food cup one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: like plastic cups with the lids Okay,
and I'll just kind of leave them in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now my buddy Faded put me on I started
using the Athena gel and man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it has made all the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried really so many things But that
seemed to that with just solid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know just solid Practices of keeping
it moist and not too wet not too hot Seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to be doing a trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you know, it's just right thing
right right place right time I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if the gel is everything my technique
better, but Since I've been using it my
[SPEAKER_01]: clones have been you know, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can do this And are you
using like the the compressed Pete plugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes The of was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the name escapes me now, but it's you
know, the ones on Amazon plug-in roots or
[SPEAKER_00]: like Q Hort or something or Right right,
that's yeah, right cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, those are those are great I am I
think like what's his name on Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: clone coach uses those and Or a couple
other people I've known have used those
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used them in the past and they always
seem to work I don't know why I just stick
[SPEAKER_00]: with like Rockwell now or I've been using
the little cocoa coins that charcoir put
[SPEAKER_00]: out like they're kind of like Like Jiffy
pellets, but rather than with peat moss
[SPEAKER_00]: there with cocoa because I always grow in
cocoa with hydro So I I like the the like
[SPEAKER_00]: media in like media and it sounds since
you're using like an organic based
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate then I'm I'm sure part of it's
like sphagnum peat moss Yeah, yeah got the
[SPEAKER_01]: peas probably about 50% soil then the rest
25% cocoa broke up a couple cocoa bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and Perlite lots and lots of
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a chronic overwaterer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you mix up your own soil Yes,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your initial mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a lot of I'll try to find like a farm
like a worm farm and I'll get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: compost The the soil basically the only
problem with that is the fungus gnats And
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where you got to break it in and
kind of just work your solution or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever through it But I've tried you
know, it's all mixed in there a Fox farm
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried bio 365 You know, so I kind of
just everything just goes into a rolling
[SPEAKER_01]: bin and I've been using this same soil For
five years now, you know, so it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping in a rotation So do you do you
like save the?
[SPEAKER_00]: The used soil and add it back into this
this mix barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I have three big tubs cool a B and
the Stuff that's like the on deck circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, that's a fresh dumped pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay I basically I'll mix up I'll add to
the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll dry it down as dry as I can I'll top
the pot with De because I'm always on the
[SPEAKER_01]: battle for the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I try to mix a soil I'll try to
kill everything that's there dry it out
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that sit for a couple days in my
basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dries it out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mix that Use the doctor earth the 444
or I had guy green at one point when it
[SPEAKER_01]: ran out I just went back to talk to earth
And that's pretty much it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I add a little gypsum add a little
potassium sulfate little powder and That's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I let it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably sits in each bin for three to
four months and it's just you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: periodically maybe once every two months
I'll water it a little bit just to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: that when I open it The top is usually
like sweating So it has that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the everything's kind of I could tell
everything's kind of getting acclimated
[SPEAKER_01]: any leaf litter I'll put in there I used
to use a hand mix but and I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: guys still swear by the hand mixer,
but I Believe in the power wash the power
[SPEAKER_01]: tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Paint mixer and that thing has
made all the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get two batteries and I'll just
Everything will be so fluffy and loamy and
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect, you know Because I think Fox farm
has the perfect soil if you would ask me
[SPEAKER_01]: who has a perfect soil I think Fox farm
the problem is they're just expensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fungus gnats It's full of frickin
fungus gnats, but it is literally the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so amazing like ocean forest or ocean
forest Okay, ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cool It's just so you know,
it's very nice and it's not clumpy It's
[SPEAKER_01]: light and that's what I try to model my
soil after that feel where nice Just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of just pick it up and it drops and it's
not you know, too dusty and whatever else
[SPEAKER_00]: so Do you get any like any like mold
blooms or anything in between mixings?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said do I add any or do you get any
like in the in the tub Yeah, like yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see some you see some things
growing in there a little uh You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially on the top layer every so often
now when I add the water, I'll mix that
[SPEAKER_01]: top layer in Add my mosquito bits on top
That's when I put the neem any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: neem I'll put sprinkle on top just to
deter any Because you know the bugs they
[SPEAKER_01]: sense it, you know, they can sense where
the good stuff is I'm sure they sense the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil And everything else so I just want to
make it not You know not a not an
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive option for them, you know,
I I grow organic everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's plenty in the garden I don't
mow the lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's plenty outside for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not sprayed that they can enjoy And
I found that they leave the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed Oh alone, you know Yeah,
that that makes sense in why patholyse
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance basically, you know Patholyse
resistance, you know, you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: beat them all just go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all this, you know Yeah,
put some tasty snacks out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's funny Yeah, I don't like to
spray anything the only thing that I do
[SPEAKER_01]: spray and I spray heavily are like the the
entrances like the windowsill around my
[SPEAKER_01]: The vent to come in like the exhaust vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll spray like where it exhausts just you
know, you always Bugs they're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the winter all that hot air
is coming out They're trying to get where
[SPEAKER_01]: the warm is, you know, everything is
freezing a snow covered Whether it be a
[SPEAKER_01]: rat or freaking something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know Do you exhaust your your
tent out out of the house out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah 24-7 it's always on Okay,
it's always pulling it's a six inch When
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that the guy traded for is still
the original thing actually Traded for it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a commercial guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was closing a commercial whatever so he
had like an 8-inch You know, it was a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: just probably like a 5-foot Exhaust vent
but you know, I still use it I just run it
[SPEAKER_01]: on its lowest setting and that's basically
allowed me to you know Still keep it going
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't I I always think like when it's a
cold space to to keep the the room sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: just to try and keep that heat in but No,
it's not even with even in the winter the
[SPEAKER_01]: HBS would uh It would it would still go
over 90 probably, you know, it'd be really
[SPEAKER_00]: hot if that Thing wasn't kicking what what
temp do you usually shoot for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think you know, I'm usually low 80s
in the morning and by afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably up You know 87 88 that's
that's what I that's my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay I don't like when it gets too in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does get hotter than that in the summer
You know, it'll start out in the mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the end of the day, it's probably
up there 92 93 So tops are roasting baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could you know, so that's not I don't
grow my best flower in the summer That's
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that's super hot It's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep air moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it's it's blowing But it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing I can do is something I can
do actually I could not be lazy and take
[SPEAKER_01]: out the HBS every summer and You have like
another LED you could put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I have an extra no It's a t5 that I have
laying around and I'm like, you know So
[SPEAKER_01]: when I do come up with an extra LED then I
will it'll be more tempting to like set it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I have two LEDs in my veg and LED
and HPS in the flower so Wow, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a That's some that's some hot hot
temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking about the do you keep it
pretty humid to try and like match the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah in the summer It's humid but that's
where you run into those those issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: those mega colas in the middle No matter
how ventilated you get when you're fooling
[SPEAKER_01]: around with that hot and it dips,
you know The lights go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the trouble comes into play a
couple times I'm running down opening the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent up and just for that hour cool down
when the lights go off That's where the
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble comes into play But you know,
you know as a home grower There's certain
[SPEAKER_01]: limitations that you have, you know,
you have you can't do I mean you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything great, but It's more realistic
that unless you're really spending the
[SPEAKER_01]: money on environment and something's gonna
suffer in the seasons and for me my
[SPEAKER_01]: Achilles heel is that You know that middle
of summer Those random hot and humid days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know But uh, so it happens for sure So
out of like your whole gross setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think is like the most
important part to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: and and in how you grow and and Is there
anything like unique about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the the tea aspect is
something that is You know, maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: overlooked, you know, I hear people say
They do teas once a month, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear people say they do teas every
couple weeks, you know For me a tea is
[SPEAKER_01]: just aerated water with a little banana
peel, you know Doesn't really it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be anything complex I use a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you heard a shillaget It's
like, all right, you know, it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar, but I couldn't place it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the It's supposedly like some
rosin from the Himalayas basically has
[SPEAKER_01]: like a humic and fulvic Basically,
I add that to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use that some banana peel some doctor
earth and You know a little molasses and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an air stone each one Goes in a
gallon jug and it just sits there For 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes a huge difference you
and I do that daily Do you add it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you add any like?
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial consortiums or anything like
that to promote the biology or is it all
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a nutrient tea That's in the
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like It's in a container of old
jacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've upcycled it and it says flour mix and
it's a recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use recharge Okay, that's my stuff for
the microbes I've used great white
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamite go in the past but really nerding
out and getting into the You know the
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in this what's in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I paying for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come back to recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wait a minute They actually do have a
pretty solid, you know, it seems like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty solid I know a lot of people swear
by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they swear by you know, and it seems
to work that great white is also another
[SPEAKER_01]: good one that But yeah, it's just a little
dabble do you it's so much it's so little
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount that you need like literally a
The faintest dusting on the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gallon each is in each gallon jug
Just the faintest dusting will turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: water a color and you know, that's enough
nice I mean as long as you're feeding them
[SPEAKER_00]: the sugar and you know, those other All
that other stuff that you're putting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water is is feeding them as well And
in most cases, you know, you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: multiplying those numbers over that 24
hours Yeah, I think that makes a huge huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that air and that water just You
know the plants just they seem to like it
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that it sounds awesome Let's see I
wanted to ask a couple more questions of
[SPEAKER_00]: you And did you have any solid out time
that you needed to get going by?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool so You know, I know that
you are just a home grower and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that as just a home grower So let me
rephrase that so I know that you're a home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and I'm not sure do you have any
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial experience have you have you
like toured any facilities seen anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like had any friends doing commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't correct yourself my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am just a home grower It's that's you
know, I think that's That's what I that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah going I went to Colorado once I was
actually trying to buy In my when I was in
[SPEAKER_01]: my home buying mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to leave New York desperately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all first thing I'm gonna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of New York right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm living in New York now, by the way So
I went to Colorado I went to see a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries I went to see like facilities
and different things and I was blown away
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't do anything like that I don't
do anything like that's that is so
[SPEAKER_01]: technical and you know, I like to just I
like it more natural and I like to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the music and I like to have the feel You
know, I don't like anything feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific, you know, it is scientific
really if you're thinking about it you're
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing plant science, but You know,
it's not You know as a hobbyist you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily need to make it you know To
like the the the professional scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: PFC and EC and pH and light meter Mike
guys, you know, the plants are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fine Yeah, you know, it's why we
need all these meters in the solution and
[SPEAKER_01]: the what what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I think there's definitely a
place for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong It's like being a home
cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still want to go out to restaurants,
you know, you still want Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I still love going out for a nice
restaurant that's how I feel with the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, you know You cook at home
and it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great But you still want to go to a
frickin steakhouse and get that top shell
[SPEAKER_01]: for whatever and you know See like wow,
these guys are really all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is what I can really aspire
to here You know this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like an experience based
Association I guess yeah, I get that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I love eating out and I was
classically trained as a chef and I did
[SPEAKER_00]: that for like a decade before I got into
the cannabis industry, so I am Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's different different things that I
feel like we crave and we not only crave
[SPEAKER_00]: like what we can do but also like the What
other people can show in the same category
[SPEAKER_00]: just to experience it in different ways So
I am I totally totally understand that But
[SPEAKER_00]: so as a home grower then like what would
you want to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Change in the cannabis industry overall
like let's just call the industry You know
[SPEAKER_00]: from home growers to consumers to
dispensaries to large commercials grows
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and and everything in between
what what would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean I guess just you know,
they Take the restrictions away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think it's silly that One state
I can grow it I can sell it I can boutique
[SPEAKER_01]: it I can do whatever I want if I go two
hours that away Now it's a different
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's kind of like
Legal or not legal, you know, okay or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's come to an agreement Yeah,
and then the second thing that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest rip is the insta nonsense You know
as much as I praise and they've been the
[SPEAKER_01]: light that is open, you know shine lights
on whole industries I didn't even know
[SPEAKER_01]: existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are all also, you know Sometimes you
get caught in the weeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and next thing, you know, you're banned
and you're restricting like wait What did
[SPEAKER_01]: I I posted a plant pick like wait if
that's what you're going by then just
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you're gonna shut the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what do you what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted I posted a marijuana picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I did, you know, so it's like
Sometimes that is unclear and then you ask
[SPEAKER_01]: a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like alright, let me You know the
going to AI and it's Like all automated,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's not like a person you can
reach out to that didn't use common sense
[SPEAKER_01]: on it But yeah, I think that I think the
community is based on Instagram for better
[SPEAKER_01]: or for worse You know, yeah is Instagram
will bust at this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's other platforms,
but You know, it's it they fizzle out they
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to fizzle out, you know, they seem to
all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all gonna go back To X.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everybody on X That'll last a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to freaking threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it Pardon my language.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh back on Insta, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know for better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're the overlords right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, it's uh, it is unfortunate I feel
like just the not only the stigma because
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the stigma keeps people in the
mindset of wanting to Cover up and hide
[SPEAKER_00]: away the You know, it feels like we're
like the the dirty little secret that the
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of America doesn't want to
necessarily talk about in some aspects as
[SPEAKER_00]: the as the cannabis industry where it's
yeah, this semi-legal or quasi-legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know ambiguousness of having states
rights be able to say it's okay and Still
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time having federal agencies
like the DEA you know continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecute people and It does just seem
like an overall Weird farce and facade
[SPEAKER_00]: that Should it needs to become more clear
because it does then make it so that if
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are operating in the United
States like Instagram or or Facebook even
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know, I guess they're all kind of
part of the same thing They they will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to shut down people that are
breaking those federal laws that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: beholden to make sure Hold on a sec
breaking those laws slash Aren't paying
[SPEAKER_01]: them right because if you want to sew this
that's some of the stuff that's suggested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, wait a minute Like this is a
drug like I don't mind but like You're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying I can't post a picture but
Promoting the sex app, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only fans did it like wait a minute
like yeah, you're You'll sell me the you
[SPEAKER_01]: can buy the weed from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can market but you can't you know,
if it's free Oh, you're not paying us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I think people that's
where people run into it is They can do
[SPEAKER_01]: fine if they're doing it on their own But
once insta gets a hook gets wind that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're selling Giving out cash app doing
any type of foolishness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when they start shutting down And
yo, they have access to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know the keywords, you know people
money any money sign or money that money
[SPEAKER_01]: How much how much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn I got shut down what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, you're posting posting pictures
again like dang, but you know on the end
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, you were also Selling this or
selling seeds or clones and you weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: paying Instagram any any revenues,
you know, so I know of one One of the
[SPEAKER_00]: moderators that I'm a moderator with on on
Reddit on the craft marijuana subreddit He
[SPEAKER_00]: uses Instagram to promote his seed sales
and he pays them monthly for ads and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't shut down his account because he's
paying them and so It's definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: pay-to-play in certain aspects and some
people can direct like direct people
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to cannabis seed sales through
Instagram's Forget about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing direct to herb direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah flower like wait a minute I think as
long as you're paying for it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as you're paying baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it You know, it's as long as
you're paying you're good to go and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the asterisk that they don't like to
mention They want to say oh marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: No say what it really is, you know You pay
us or you don't do this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's like the old drug
dealer from the block if you're not paying
[SPEAKER_01]: my Frickin piece, you're not gonna do this
business here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of now the digital my you
know, it's a digital black hand Yeah in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That's you know, it's a great great
analogy because it is like definitely the
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the territory control a paying
for protection almost, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is my neighborhood You want to sell
here you pay me a piece of all your
[SPEAKER_00]: profits Wow, yeah Instagram is just a
bunch of gangsters That's the big pimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well, it's unfortunate because you're
right it it is like the community that
[SPEAKER_00]: people keep coming back to because the
Opportunity to connect with you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a wide swath of people from the industry
is so great and you know, like there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: fair amount of people that will respond to
your DMS and stuff that You might have
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble finding in any other in any other
way that can open up the opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: that someone like even myself have used to
get into the industry into certain spaces
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, it's unfortunate they then
go around and criminalize those who are
[SPEAKER_00]: not able to Pay the piper so to speak
because it's literally everything is right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like your resume is there You can
peek into your actual real life if they
[SPEAKER_01]: watch your story Hey, what's this guy
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see the real him not the dressed
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever Let me see what he's really about
in two seconds of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's like, alright, I'll answer him
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright exactly So yeah, but now even with
a eyes, you don't know if they're real or
[SPEAKER_00]: not That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, you know, there's too many
bots If I remember back in the day we used
[SPEAKER_01]: to make fun of our parents like ah,
you got tricked by that old That old
[SPEAKER_01]: prince in Africa, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: You rascal No, it's like what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it that AI tricked me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought that was real It's so
and so's fifth or sixth account create
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Well, so I have just a few more
questions and then we're gonna get to like
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of Sort of wrap-up questions so
How how do you think growers can protect
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves from the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know like even with what you're
saying where you'd like to see Kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just more transparency in terms of how
things Go with legalization like let's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like let's make up our minds on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not have Let's not have it be so
ambiguous any longer So like with that in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind and and if the ambiguity continues,
how do you think that like home growers
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourselves should protect themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Mean the answer is not going to be
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna be sexy You know,
I think the best way is to be Insulated in
[SPEAKER_01]: other markets and to be you know,
have that be your passion But what I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: how how highly do you think of the the
farmer who makes your corn?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how highly do you think of the
farmer who makes?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know your your Brussels sprouts,
you know, what other crop do you really
[SPEAKER_01]: think of the farmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know farmers forgotten about who the
heck cares, you know who?
[SPEAKER_01]: The person putting their hands in the dirt
They're they're not rich and famous and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know So if it's if it's that that
you're after then make sure your
[SPEAKER_01]: personality is you tell funny jokes or you
know If you're a lady, you're really
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and dance, you know, whatever it
is, but have an other name niche that You
[SPEAKER_01]: know because you know, it's it's growing
like who grows the most tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Who's the most popular tomato
grow once it becomes legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like a farm crop, you know,
and farming is not so sexy So I think
[SPEAKER_01]: people can just do what they like make
sure it's something you like if you like
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow Do that, you know, no one can in
organic garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like your organic garden It makes you
feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can taste the juice The difference
your family's happy about it You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what else do you need past that if you're
doing it for them for the fame and the
[SPEAKER_01]: riches?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know you might it might
be a tougher of a go But if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it just for your health benefits,
you're gonna be happy if you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for cost benefits You're gonna be happy if
you're doing it for your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna be happy But long as you keep
those intentions pure, I think you know
[SPEAKER_01]: sky's the limit You know insulate from
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're insulating yourself from costs,
you know call The cost of a pound goes up
[SPEAKER_01]: for top 4x and it don't mean shit for you
You know the cost goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can't make no money off this doesn't
mean anything for you You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like yeah, that's good,
you know So so it sounds like keep growing
[SPEAKER_00]: at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we grow ourselves live within
the means and just kind of Don't you know
[SPEAKER_01]: just not be affected by?
[SPEAKER_01]: The little things, you know, you don't
want Instagram to their one policy change
[SPEAKER_01]: is now affected your whole life and now
you know That's that's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough tough out it is well night,
I mean, I think that's a great answer
[SPEAKER_00]: because You know, I feel like home growing
is definitely the way forward with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of aspects of the the cannabis culture and
the community around growing and I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that's part of the reason why I'm doing
this podcast is to make sure that people
[SPEAKER_00]: know that everyone can grow and it's
something that's available in a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different scenarios and Yeah,
like people like yourself where you you've
[SPEAKER_00]: had experiences indoor and outdoor and
this and that and This location in that
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's um, you know, hopefully it inspires
more people to just want to grow at home
[SPEAKER_01]: and give it a try Yeah, no matter what you
produce it It's it's gonna be You're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be you're gonna be happy, you know
Obviously the more you put into it if you
[SPEAKER_01]: like doing the thing that helps a lot but
just knowing it's something you created
[SPEAKER_01]: and you You know put your time into it's
gonna be a good result.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone should try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should do it Absolutely good for
the soul Absolutely hundred percent on
[SPEAKER_00]: that So, you know knowing what you know
now about all the different growing
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects that you can You know put that pin
on your your badge of You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am I am a grower with all of these
accomplishments What would you want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice would you want to give
yourself before you ever put that first
[SPEAKER_00]: seed in the dirt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Flow and steady wins the race You know
That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think sometimes you get caught
up in the rushing I used to be a Stickler
[SPEAKER_01]: on times.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, six weeks eight weeks ten
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been ten weeks time to cut I don't do
times anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget about weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's all Depends it's
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be anything, you know,
you could get an early finisher Suppose
[SPEAKER_01]: this one wants to finish a 49 days,
you know, and you're taking it or as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as wants to finish 75 days You know,
it just let the plant do its thing slow
[SPEAKER_01]: and steady, you know, you're gonna grow it
You're gonna make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's best to make the mistake,
you know Before you grow too big and you
[SPEAKER_01]: ruin a whole room you ruin a whole You
know, it's good to kind of get your get
[SPEAKER_01]: your feet under you, you know,
you crawl then you walk then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running You know a lot of times on insta.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I just want to run maybe run
maybe run, you know you get guys Going
[SPEAKER_01]: high octane and then you know,
it's just crash and burn, you know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's great advice though because
I feel like you know that applies to So
[SPEAKER_00]: many different aspects of life makes me
think of cooking again where you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you ask the chef a chef How long until
that's done and he looks at you and he
[SPEAKER_00]: goes it'll be done when it's done And you
know like with flowers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even heard people calling it,
you know, I'm cooking it You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm letting it cook in those last in
those last couple weeks, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just just let those trichomes ripen
let those Calyxes swell up let let that
[SPEAKER_00]: that expression of color come through in
the senescence and yeah, I I feel like you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be patient sometimes and Some
people you know, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's the you know,
the the common thing of always being like
[SPEAKER_00]: two more weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like just give it two more weeks
or of course, you know a little more calm
[SPEAKER_00]: egg, but the the two more weeks thing is I
feel like pretty it's a pretty good pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good advice for any new girl or because
Like even something like someone like
[SPEAKER_00]: myself who has some some experience
growing for a little while now and I I
[SPEAKER_00]: still have trouble sometimes getting that
perfectly right, but and I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: think necessarily it's always something
that is is always going to happen like I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like if you have some improper
practices, whether it be You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it like too high of heat or Not
dropping the the temperatures or the the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidities towards The the late flowering
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah you know, you can really extend
that flowering time and Really make it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it wants to just keep producing new
bracts with or new Calyxes with more white
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols and and it wants to keep growing
so that it can accept pollen because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like the whole Process of its life
is just to accept pollen produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah make seeds and reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you give it, you know If you
continue to provide all that energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce those parts of the plant,
then it's just going to keep going and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going and so but also it will it will
stop at some point and That's also I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like where a lot of people get this huge
learning curve of how to taper down those
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plant responses towards the end of
flower and get a better senescence
[SPEAKER_00]: response so that you can get those nice
Instagram worthy Bud shots where it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: that The hairs are orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is colored out and triked out
and it's just beautiful frosty flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I feel like the the idea of slow and
steady and just Don't don't rush yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself time and you'll learn from
everything that you do and and take that
[SPEAKER_00]: into the next one is just stellar advice
Yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's uh, you know, yes into life,
you know, you gotta sometimes stop and
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell the roses, you know, smell the
flowers smell the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would see what you got going on and
just just appreciate it Absolutely All
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just got now some wrap-up
questions for you that are gonna be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of my little ubiquitous Cannabis podcast
questions that I feel like everyone asks
[SPEAKER_00]: but I always feel as though they're worth
hearing because it's uh It's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that almost every grower can relate to So,
um, what's your favorite strain of all
[SPEAKER_00]: time that you've grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you've smoked whether or not you
grew it I'm gonna have to say Mac one
[SPEAKER_01]: First I have but plenty of my buddies give
me crap for that For that answer and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what I like, you know, what can I
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cookie monster Hey, I mean if you
like cookies Mac one is one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies that is just it's up there with
like You know like the the foreign cut or
[SPEAKER_00]: something where it's just it's just Got
that uniqueness to it where it's it's such
[SPEAKER_00]: good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's creamy and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, people say it's boring but Call
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe I'm just a boring guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, coca-cola is boring if you think
about it, but I love a cold coke with a
[SPEAKER_00]: burger 100% right All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I love that Mac one, you know,
like I'd for the longest time that was my
[SPEAKER_00]: most sought-after strain because it it was
something that even to find like the rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: or the flour was elusive because only a
few people had the cuts and So you'd find
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the you know in the rec market
somewhere and you'd buy like Three grams
[SPEAKER_00]: or something spend all your all your money
on a few down there a few few chunks of a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice-looking flour but I Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mac one is definitely at least on
the top the top five list for most people
[SPEAKER_00]: if they've if they've tried it grown
really well 100% yeah All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's your favorite breeder of all time
whether or not this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the flower that you've had smoked
of it or that you've seen of it produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by other people or whether it be just due
to the the growing properties that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced um, I would say the breeder
that's probably You know, I think cap is
[SPEAKER_01]: up there, but I'd probably go thug pug for
that next spot Just a breeder when he you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, the type of funky nasty stuff that
I'll get out of that stuff and classics
[SPEAKER_01]: like peanut butter breath I Think he's
always got something in the mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whether it's that a lot of stuff
you even see other people They'll take the
[SPEAKER_01]: meat breath or whatever else They'll have
to hear they'll make whole family lines
[SPEAKER_01]: off of just that meat breath, you know
just so I think he has a lot of A lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: classics in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like his his genetics have made
other people fortunes almost sure sure
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great breeder I I remember one of
the first places that I worked at in the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial market We had this cut of
peanut butter breath That was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: our staple and we grew it every round and
it was just so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was I do miss that and oh,
yeah, I haven't ever grown out meat breath
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know that I've gotten a clone from
from someone and I just never got around
[SPEAKER_00]: to flowering it out because like right as
I was about to I had to to move to a new
[SPEAKER_00]: spot and just cleared everything out
because it was Untenable to take it all
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe again in the future that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Am but yeah thug pugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an amazing breeder Yeah, he gets a
lot of he just you know gets it whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: his selection is that that I for that male
or whatever it is You know, he just has
[SPEAKER_01]: that something something that makes it
makes it pretty classic when he does do
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep What's it that his the male that he
uses for a bunch of stuff is called studly
[SPEAKER_00]: spew, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That's it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of naming a male plant
just that you're keeping around because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Like I feel like everything else just
kind of leans towards like a female naming
[SPEAKER_00]: process or using sure Yeah, like
traditional guys to do that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I you know I don't know if anybody else
that did it before him for sure But I know
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that have done it after him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely definitely myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely I have as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Yeah, it's a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know that that is right I might as
well give him a manly studly, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of you know, just a boisterous name
Just so masculine he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's hilarious So what what was
your most memorable cannabis related
[SPEAKER_00]: experience whether it be like smoking or
or just other cannabis hijinks I Mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess just being able to smoke it in
different places You know grow it and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it and you know now that you have a
house and it's kind of like as a kid You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you kind of just smoke it wherever
you can, you know You didn't really get to
[SPEAKER_01]: plan too much, but I guess now growing in
and kind of getting to plan and package
[SPEAKER_01]: and Go everywhere with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I want to go on, you know to
the mountains it's it's a you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible fashion, you know,
you're doing everything there or I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: recently I have another trip to Hawaii
plans and you know something about smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in Hawaii is uh You know,
I don't know it's I think it's I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been since 2019 but um, I'm planning to go
back this next summer but something about
[SPEAKER_01]: just smoking weed there is like You know,
it doesn't matter if you're by the beach
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're you know in the mountains
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like You know just that spirit just
that relaxation like you really get that
[SPEAKER_01]: true relaxation The aloha spirit so nice
probably be doing one of those one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know hiking Paying off the one of the
guys doing it on the zip lining,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Kinds of crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get into You know, and I feel
like I know the answer already to this but
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your favorite method of
consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Joint I'm strictly a joints white paper
No, no tobacco Whatsoever no, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just they're inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, you know, they're
there but they're tasty Oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna blow through a lot of a lot
of A lot of material but um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're trying to conserve I definitely
say grab a bowl and make it last but When
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing it, you can roll it as fat
as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing better than a big old
stinky joint Yeah, I mean I personally
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't smoked a joint in a couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just stick to a volcano a vaporizer or
like one of their their handheld
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizers just I was oh, yeah,
your lungs will thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was hacking up a lung for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I Definitely had to cut back on that
but I was also, you know a smoker of
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes for a decade or more and that
probably did a little number on my lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: where the cannabis is just Exacerbating
that experience But yeah, I I do love
[SPEAKER_00]: joints I mean, I also was a huge like
blunt connoisseur for the longest time but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah joints I've seen so many videos on
your stories where you just have like big
[SPEAKER_00]: old finger joints that are just dripping
with resin and It always just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: makes me salivate a little bit Yeah,
man, I definitely let me you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most resinous strains I ever
grown was one of one that you gave me a
[SPEAKER_01]: the strawberry military Yeah, dude that
that ruined it ruined a couple sleeves,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you have the filters man that
thing was That was some like I know if I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to break that over a joint it has to
be a cold day It has to be at least 30
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees in my garage I even think to break
that out or my hands are gonna be stuck to
[SPEAKER_01]: literally everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy That sucker is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm definitely can't wait to grow some
more of that stuff out I hope I still have
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost so much in the move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to see if I can find some but I
have a couple on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I actually f2d it I won't I might
need to get some of those back from you to
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue the line and put it back to
the military chocolate I reversed meat
[SPEAKER_01]: breath to a couple I did I did some funky
stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was definitely one of those
resin Monsters couldn't believe it could
[SPEAKER_00]: not believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberry guava itself was a bag seed
from a strawberry guava plant that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested outdoors at a facility and we
found the seed in it and it turned out to
[SPEAKER_00]: be female and it I Didn't even that was
one of the last times I grew plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and flowered the seed plant and I
didn't save a cutting of it and I just I
[SPEAKER_00]: just went straight with the pollination of
it and then just broke up the buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it as I was as I was pulling seeds
out and it was So tasty, I kind of like to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that doing that Dude, that's that's how
the best strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how that's how It goes,
you know, it's a happenstance not like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was intentional though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I got some seeds It was the worst
structure plant too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like bangers it was spindly and and
like the the buds were just like these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know solid stacks of calyxes that were
maybe three inches long growing and it had
[SPEAKER_00]: like no structure to it whatsoever,
but it was just fully resined out and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just it tasted it exactly like
strawberries and bananas and so I was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of devastated that I lost that but you
know live and learn and I'm glad that that
[SPEAKER_00]: was like such a memorable experience for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you say that I'll have to next
time I'm going through that bag I'll put
[SPEAKER_01]: some together for you for sure dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome I will I will grow
those out and hopefully save something
[SPEAKER_01]: this time definitely man It's always good
when you think one got away and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy has some seed somewhere Like oh,
I still have some seeds of that little
[SPEAKER_01]: fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I feel like that's the best part
about sharing too and another point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry where people could Maybe take a
little pointer of just getting some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genetics out to more people just so
that they're there if they need them
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now everyone's still kind of
in the I'm gonna hit it rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a goal Once they get their heads
out of the sand and realize it's for
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing for community Not for love,
not for these big capitalistic plans,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is not that you know,
you want to do that go to Bitcoin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is this is a plan,
you know, this is something deeper than
[SPEAKER_01]: just a quick little, you know hoarding
thing or flipping or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, it's deeper than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a that's a great a great
point and a great way to end this on it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis is deeper than a lot of people
give it credit for and we should all just
[SPEAKER_00]: You know respect the plan a little more
and hope that we get a little more respect
[SPEAKER_00]: as a community if we if we get people to
stop with the stigma Yeah, a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent It was good talking to you
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was great talking to you as well
I I really appreciate your time and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a lot of people are gonna enjoy this
conversation Copy that hope so right on You
