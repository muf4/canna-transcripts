[SPEAKER_01]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are the only place that you can
get the Gabby Staten Island collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Gabby Staten Island and we've got
Nick Wolf and the Slovenian Hobbit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have our special guest Kevin Jodri
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so today we're excited to talk with
Kevin and have him tell us his stories and
[SPEAKER_02]: how he began in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kevin has a very long history in
cannabis from hustling and the drug war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working in the Bay Area, in Oakland,
in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's run dispensaries, nurseries,
and many grow operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, I think you made the Ganjier
program?
[SPEAKER_02]: Co-founded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you founded it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's won Golden Tarp awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I invented the Golden Tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you invented the Golden Tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You invented the Golden Tarp, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's been doing international
consulting and business development in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: For many, many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we're very excited to have you
on the show, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I want to say before we started
is that I had heard your name before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew about Wonderland Nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't really know that much about
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw some clips over on the first
smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I was just blown away by
those clips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a friend requested you on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess you followed back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked you if you wanted to do the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so excited when you said that
you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have not watched the rest of the
first smoke of the day because I always
[SPEAKER_02]: like it to be as much of a surprise when I
record my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to encourage everyone at
some point to go check out the first smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: of the day and the interview that Kevin
did with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, Kevin, we're just going to give
you the mic and tell us your story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went out this really cool event that
I went to this weekend that was called the
[SPEAKER_04]: High Tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was put on by Nicotet, founder of
Essential Extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had it over at the Gangier campus
in Southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the second year they did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was so interesting because I like
tea, but I'm not hyper knowledgeable about
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a group come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to remember the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've spent a lot of time in China
as tea importers, exporters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so their knowledge of tea was really
comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they bring all these really
interesting varieties of tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they do is they get together with
Nick's team, which is Alex Sherma,
[SPEAKER_04]: Tyler, and Lindsay, who prepare the food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this gal in Sarah Jane does the
tasting bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Lena Burns does the hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Lena, she was one of these two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like true Frenchie apprentices that turned
master.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Bell out of Mendo and Lena out of
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of them were Frenchies full time,
you know, developed worker and then became
[SPEAKER_04]: masters of their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like her knowledge of hash is
unbelievable and her ability to create
[SPEAKER_04]: good hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah's and her fella fantastic at flavor
component.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Alex and his team, a phenomenal
and chef.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they do is they take a look at the
tea, and then they match the food pairings
[SPEAKER_04]: and hash pairings with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's these crazy flavor centric
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's over the course of like,
you know, eight hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every hour, another flight of hash
comes out another flight of food and
[SPEAKER_04]: another type of tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so and you can you can smoke what was
previous, but you keep getting these fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's held up like set up in at the
ganja campus and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Derek's spot is I think like 240
acres on top of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you're up there, man,
you basically just swept into the
[SPEAKER_04]: wilderness of Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're drinking all this aged tea,
and you're smoking all this hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're eating all this food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're you're you're kind of like
sucked into a vortex of of gustatory
[SPEAKER_04]: goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you leave, you're kind of sad
that it had to end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm drooling.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could spend every day just drinking
really good tea, and smoking really good
[SPEAKER_04]: hash and eat really good food in an
environment filled with people that were,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, vibing the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they ever do another one,
man, or if you ever get a chance to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: one of those type of pairings,
you know, I'd recommend it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an absolutely fascinating
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it open to the public or was it by
invitation only?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was invitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You paid to get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the the concept doesn't have to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could create one of your own where
you, you know, one of your friends is is
[SPEAKER_04]: good at the culinary.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of your friends is good at the hash
collection, meaning like assembling the
[SPEAKER_04]: hash to match the food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get somebody who's really
knowledgeable about the tea end of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just really fun because the thing
with the tea was it's such an ancient
[SPEAKER_04]: culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was in Asia, what I noticed was
the tea ceremony matches the prayer
[SPEAKER_04]: ceremony matches the hash consumption
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's these periods through the
day where you pray, you take tea and you
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we kind of we kind of and it's
ritualistic, but ritualistic in a in a
[SPEAKER_04]: really healthy way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that, you know, the ability for
people to be able to sit down and enjoy
[SPEAKER_04]: these things in this regard, because for
at least 15 minutes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you stop what you're doing, you give
thanks, you drink tea, which clears your
[SPEAKER_04]: head, kind of opens you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the cannabis makes you connect
into the the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like your favorite
combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about something that is
happening here in my area with a family
[SPEAKER_03]: member of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he has a he has one of the
oldest bamboo gardens in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's a professor of art and he
has a sauna in the bamboo garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's doing tea ceremony since two
years now, like tea ritual, let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, everything you tell now is
like home to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we are I'm the European correspondent
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, it's really big honor for
me to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my pleasure, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got lucky and I spent the majority of my
career hiding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the majority of career when you're in
the hustle is, you know, you make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody knows who you are, except everybody
you hustle with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you develop a really good, strong like
name reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was never really on forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't I I use social media kind of on a
minimal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really take a look at my output,
it's low.
[SPEAKER_04]: What what's high is my engagement and me
being involved with other people's work in
[SPEAKER_04]: that regard, because it makes it fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I have to do it myself,
it feels forced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I and it's nothing it's not
against people who live online.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just purely if you're living in
cannabis with licensed operate,
[SPEAKER_04]: even in the past, like large operations,
you run in a large operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have time to be online all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it it just never fit my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I get older, because I'm
older, the online lifestyle wasn't so
[SPEAKER_04]: critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a really great tool to meet
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use it in kind of like a duality
where I'm a sports freak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean like I like watching
sports.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like I like sports science and I like
being athletic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the Internet lets me keep track of
all these people around me.
[SPEAKER_04]: People around the world that I got to
train with and got to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get like all my sports related
connections and then I get hobby stuff and
[SPEAKER_04]: then I get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it lets me have like a really diverse
global friend base.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I I just kind of look at it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't I don't get so triggered.
[SPEAKER_04]: So online stuff doesn't like, you know,
like it to me, it's not real.
[SPEAKER_04]: If for most people, if they shut down
their Instagram, their whole game ends
[SPEAKER_04]: that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't end my game at all because
I have functional, physical businesses and
[SPEAKER_04]: operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually work in the industry
globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, enjoying the conversation is
what I dig.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why, you know, I took a look
when you guys first popped up and then I
[SPEAKER_04]: saw the interview you did with Mark and
then I saw there was Wolf on the other
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love Wolf because he's a fucking
genius.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just an interesting dude,
too, because he's such a salty bastard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and he has to be because he is he's
salty as hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love him because I respect what he
did was he really, really, really did his
[SPEAKER_04]: homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did create that initial we would
call see a green where ultra high density
[SPEAKER_04]: planting sites and he developed cultivars
that fit that that methodology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then his knowledge of lighting is is
is premium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I got lucky that when it comes to
lighting, I was able to spend time with
[SPEAKER_04]: brilliant light scientists from around the
world on projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it it allows me to get access to
information I otherwise wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the average individual that isn't
hanging out with light scientists from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill Gates Institute, Wolf is probably the
most accessible, smart person you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's not afraid to really break the
information down because he's not afraid
[SPEAKER_04]: of you taking it and suddenly surpassing
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have to spend your whole life
studying it in order to catch him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like he's paused either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I love about, you know,
good guests.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I saw the good guests and I was
checking it out and I think I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: you got me like, oh, you know,
good show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's kind of began our
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that, you know, the intent of
what you're trying to do is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, being able to be on podcasts
with people that want to explore the world
[SPEAKER_04]: we're in is critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's and like I said, it's not that I
think there's a rank in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's just that most spend their time
in their house.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your your totality of what you see is
relatively small.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean your product isn't
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be some of the best in the world
coming out of your one lighter in your
[SPEAKER_04]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really about exposure to a
totality, a bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's kind of what I got
lucky to have is that my career was built
[SPEAKER_04]: during, like, the peak of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I got into medical cannabis,
I was already around 40 years old by that
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I already had, you know, since I was
12.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I already had, you know, almost 28
years of playing in the sandbox before I
[SPEAKER_04]: got into medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And medical cannabis to me is not that I
had a 215, which is the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendation in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had that in 96 because I knew Dr.
Micaria.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I grabbed the 215, but it was to
protect me from having like an ounce in my
[SPEAKER_04]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it wasn't going to protect me on
the level I was at because my plant counts
[SPEAKER_04]: were insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wasn't it was a little different
reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I never considered myself medical I
just had a 215.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew the architects of that era.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had access.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was when I got into running a
dispensary that I officially said I'm in
[SPEAKER_04]: medical cannabis because the emphasis of
your work changes and you get into the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary end of it and you think you're
going to be doing like storefront sales
[SPEAKER_04]: and you don't really understand that
you're becoming a semi hospice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you start to see this reality of
people who use cannabis in this essential
[SPEAKER_04]: method, essential need, and it changes
your perspective of what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I was already what I would say
successful, I didn't get into medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis because that was my time to come
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was already up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually lost money going into medical
cannabis because I had to give up all the
[SPEAKER_04]: crooked hustle and I was doing,
which was really where the money was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I knew there was like this two part
reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one that it was the only path
forward because I knew that the world we
[SPEAKER_04]: were in was going to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once I get involved in the medical end
of it, it was it was this catharsis of
[SPEAKER_04]: helping people that you don't know that
have no ability to help you back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of links you into the human
experience in a way I'd never been linked
[SPEAKER_04]: in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it made my life really kind of like
rich in a way I'd never experienced.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to say you have this kind of
thing that you live in your life,
[SPEAKER_03]: a way of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then because of the system,
you see the way and you choose the way to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it in another way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like from your perspective, from my
perspective, your perspective would be the
[SPEAKER_03]: term from illegality to legality,
how to make it legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know, and you are, you know,
of course, from from perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: Europeans know we are just legal,
not legalizing, decriminalizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the system that you have now is like
you already have 10 years of legalization
[SPEAKER_03]: behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew that I knew that it's like
everything you do in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You you can't take skills from one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called extrapolating where you take
something from something and apply it to
[SPEAKER_04]: something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is that there's these
assumptions that the skills or the
[SPEAKER_04]: information transfers linearly and it's
not linear.
[SPEAKER_04]: It it's big gaping holes of lack of
understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I got that opportunity to take
over that operation and it was it was
[SPEAKER_04]: neat, too, because the operation I took
over was one of the second or third
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the oldest operations in the
country and it was failing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The management was confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had a great team.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that I like ended up,
you know, running were good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were about the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were good with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But your management was off and they
didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, at that fundamental level,
they didn't understand drug dealing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't quite understand like what the
needs of the people who come in the store
[SPEAKER_04]: are and how these little things we do make
that experience so much different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I came in, I took over the
spot as the cultivation director,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I really kind of ended up becoming
like cultivation director slash
[SPEAKER_04]: operationals manager.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I changed the way we operated the
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I took a business that was going
bankrupt and failing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first two years I ran it,
we won Best Dispensary in Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: California, you know, for two years in a
row.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always tell people that I said,
listen, I have never had a day of retail
[SPEAKER_04]: experience in my life, never worked in a
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never worked in a store.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent my whole fucking life in the dope
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: What people need to understand is that we
do understand people pretty well in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of how they want to be treated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you understand how people want to
be treated, you can do your best to
[SPEAKER_04]: satisfy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're never going to do perfect all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to fail and you're going to
make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you put the effort out,
people forgive you for your failures
[SPEAKER_04]: because they see that there's an effort
that is genuine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens is they learn to kind of
meet you in the middle and then they teach
[SPEAKER_04]: you how to help them better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I allowed the people that came in
the business to kind of guide me as to
[SPEAKER_04]: what they wanted and needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it allowed me to better understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think like, you know, one of the
jokes was that I took my office,
[SPEAKER_04]: I took my desk out of my office and I put
it in the lobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had an empty desk in the lobby that I
sat at to do all the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it did is it allowed anybody who
came in the business to access somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: that when you talk to people at a counter,
you don't feel powerful because you feel
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a filter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can talk to the manager and you
can get access to them and the same
[SPEAKER_04]: information from the manager's mouth is
coming out of the worker's mouth,
[SPEAKER_04]: it validates the worker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now when people come in, they start to
understand that the people that are at the
[SPEAKER_04]: counter are intelligent too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, that's the scene of like,
when I came into the business,
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody wanted to talk to me at first,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I laughed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had my secretary go to the store,
go to Staples, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The office.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, go get me a badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, write this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it said Cultivation Director in my
name, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, watch this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: People look at you, then they look at your
badge and it says Cultivation Director.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instantly, you're smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, we all need badges that just
say, bad motherfucker on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that looks at this thing
automatically thinks you're elevated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now the conversation is different
because the issue with cannabis is that
[SPEAKER_04]: because people spent so much time in
seclusion, semi-seclusion, working with
[SPEAKER_04]: it, developing it, they've developed some
unbelievably strong relationship ties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But their overall knowledge of the picture
in many cases, most, is kind of skewed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when they come into stores,
they always want to tell everybody,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know more than you because you're just a
worker in a store and I'm this person who
[SPEAKER_04]: knows all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens is the worker and the
customer can't find common ground to
[SPEAKER_04]: communicate and neither's left happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The budtenders are like, these jobs suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people who come into stores are
always saying to the budtenders,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really this kind of conflict.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like your transmission isn't working
correctly because the clutch isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: stopping the flywheel and you're not able
to shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: The synchronizers aren't working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just grinding, grinding.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you can align everything,
everything meshes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what I was really
trying to do most was create that meshing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it- Make relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it hadn't been done because the
world of cannabis and even in storefront
[SPEAKER_04]: was all this secrecy still.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it did is it created a lack of
information transmittal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you weren't creating information in the
facility and getting it into the hands of
[SPEAKER_04]: the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I did is I kind of ripped the
doors off the place and let the people
[SPEAKER_04]: come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I left the place and brought the
information into the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't about information about the
shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just really how do you look at a
topic?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think I'm omnipotent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny, I'm outspoken on stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes I'm prone to add a little
bit to it where when I say all,
[SPEAKER_04]: I really mean the majority.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I say everybody does this,
people are like, no, there's an outlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I know, but if you can find an
outlier, it means most.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I kind of work on these
generalities.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what it does, it makes it simple to
make decisions and move things quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it allowed me to be able to help
people understand these are the things
[SPEAKER_04]: that are inside dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are how we use these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was you on a budget, this is how I
would approach it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't try to send you to my store.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't worried about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drugs don't need to be advertised.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just have to be presented.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where a lot of people
in retail don't quite catch dope deal in
[SPEAKER_04]: that you don't really sell drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just provide them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sell themselves, and people give
you money as an exchange for this rare
[SPEAKER_04]: item.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can be cool about the process,
you have word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your story sounds so similar to mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like a reoccurring theme that
we all, even Sasha, it's like we're so
[SPEAKER_02]: similar 6,000 miles away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I opened up my hydro store,
The Garden Spout, in 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I opened up my store,
the general practice when you walked into
[SPEAKER_02]: a grow shop was you said as little as
possible to the people that work there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you grabbed your shit, and you got out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, when you got out, you like look both
ways to make sure nobody was following
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And use your cousin's car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I opened up my shop,
I did something a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody had done it at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, my store was in downtown
Willets, you know, right in the center of
[SPEAKER_02]: town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you were driving north or south
through Willets, you basically had to
[SPEAKER_02]: drive by my store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had 1000 watt grow light on a thing
was called the Omega Garden, the spinning
[SPEAKER_02]: garden with 1000 watt light in the middle
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was on that little cam and the
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like people that were driving by,
like they were just blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they were seeing a high pressure
sodium light in a window at a grow shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was this was pretty unheard of at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing I did was I put a coffee
bar in my store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people came in, I gave them an
espresso or whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a place to sit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made it a place where the customers
felt comfortable talking to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something that had never
happened at a grow store before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were actually told exactly the
opposite is don't talk to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't mention cannabis
specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're growing tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was a fucking tomato farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to be bold in order to break
through dogma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, you know, I got lucky in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really believe it that I just I entered
public cannabis at the right time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was already grown and I already
had a good reputation in the hustle,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is why the legal work for me so
well, because once I get in the legal,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to reach out to all the people
I had done business with in the illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it instantly allowed us to start
moving plant material at large quantities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all of that stuff was I really
believe because I was 40 and I already,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I already fought a couple of
felonies and already I already had a
[SPEAKER_04]: lifetime of like struggle and grind and
then real money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I get into this, it was more like
an education of what's the future going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't realize I was going to get
this education on medical cannabis the way
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was this incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But out of that facility is where the
plant ACDC came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first CBD plant development
in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the next couple of years,
you know, I mean, I ended up personally
[SPEAKER_04]: releasing hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of free CBD based plants
[SPEAKER_04]: globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at one point in time, I was like this I
was I was like this this genetics stallion
[SPEAKER_04]: and hemp because all these countries
around the world began their hemp programs
[SPEAKER_04]: with genetics they got from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people couldn't believe that,
you know, I was giving it away for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I I had this idea that when we started
the project.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was it was originally designed
to help the doctor's wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had this idea that if we could
increase the cannabinoid stimulation and
[SPEAKER_04]: get the ECS activated with with
cannabinoids in acid form, we should be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to see an overall health increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we started to see it,
because remember, you're running a shop,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a canopy and we have customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we bring in data collection and we
bring in other people to work with the
[SPEAKER_04]: patients so we can really start to find
out what's the cannabinoids doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are the other things around you
doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just gave me this insight that was
unbelievable because no one in history up
[SPEAKER_04]: to that point had ever had this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even even the Israelis who like find
these molecular compounds, I talk to them
[SPEAKER_04]: because they do not have the number of
people coming through their programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did like we dwarfed people in in what
was taking place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was I was just a facilitator.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't come up with the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said to the doctor when he
approached me, I said, wow, this is so
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think cannabinoid therapy could do
that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believed it could do 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, if we could just get 10
percent of what's coming out of your mouth
[SPEAKER_04]: to happen, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it ended up being 200 percent,
300 percent greater than what came out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took this risk for a very limited
benefit for what.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but the benefit of 10 people out of
100 have a better life, it's worth the
[SPEAKER_04]: risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was this it was the forerunner of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one knew no one knew what to do
with the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they run the program, Dr. Creative
for his wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no one knew how to monetize it because
nobody wanted a pot that didn't get you
[SPEAKER_04]: high.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no alternative cannabinoid
medicine at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the beginning, like fucking day
one shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized, though, from the patients
and what was happening, because the people
[SPEAKER_04]: we were working with weren't cannabis
smokers, they were people who were in
[SPEAKER_04]: horrific levels of inflammatory pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had internal stomach pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had they had pain in the intestines.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had all these issues of aging and
falling apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the ones that we really came
into the program and adopted it most.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I saw was this sudden change
in validation for people who consume
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis psychoactively because they
started to understand that if I can drive
[SPEAKER_04]: a benefit from something, who am I to say
you're wrong with the way you derive
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I knew that if I drove the genes into
the system and I got people to benefit in
[SPEAKER_04]: a non psychoactive manner, then the work
that I do, which I'm interested in,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is what I do as a farmer,
as a nursery operator, is psychoactive
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would allow that to exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had an agenda of benefit,
but really it was a benefit of how do you
[SPEAKER_04]: get people to reverse their stance on the
drug war?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I'm born in 66.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was when Nixon as a when he's in the
Senate puts out that first note.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm a teenager in 1980.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Reagan comes in, 83, I catch my first
multi felony right for distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get dragged out of high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spend fucking the 11th grade incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get out of high school and my
neighborhood's a crime zone and my
[SPEAKER_04]: family's in organized crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I grew up going to prison to visit
relatives and which wasn't traumatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I was locked up,
it wasn't traumatic either.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem was all my friends were
about to go do life sentences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They either got killed or they killed
somebody or they caught, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: multi multi decade sentences for crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Criminal activity, Rico act shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't want it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was 18.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, fuck, like is this is this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loved weed, but I was like,
if this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This can't be my life, like I really don't
want to spend the rest of my life in
[SPEAKER_04]: goddamn prison and and everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when I get to be 18, we used to
swing by the prison and go visit our
[SPEAKER_04]: friends through the fucking fence at the
medium security prison because we knew
[SPEAKER_04]: their yard time and we would roll up in
the car and fucking yell to each other
[SPEAKER_04]: through the fence.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I go in the military so I could go
get an education in dive salvage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I figured, you know what I'm going to
do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go get a job as a salvage
diver and I'm going to go work globally on
[SPEAKER_04]: oil rigs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I'm going to get out of the
crime of my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I go in the military.
[SPEAKER_04]: And become a diver.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the peak of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 1985, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So they start loaning me out to the DEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the DOJ to go be the diver that they
drop out of helicopters on these fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: vessels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of a sudden, I'm 19 years old and
I'm looking at hundreds of tons of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at fucking tons of cocaine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, this is crazy,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm dying because I mean, it was so
opposite of what I had done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I was on one of those drug raids,
they raided a Canadian group that had
[SPEAKER_04]: never been busted, but were always being
looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had like a 200 foot ship.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sterile.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were international killers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm in the galley, the kitchen,
and I'm hanging out in my wetsuit and shit
[SPEAKER_04]: because I just got done doing the hull
inspection and all the other shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they bring all the crew members into
the galley to hold them while they search
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole vessel, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's ships coming and there's
fucking helicopters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the captain says to me, yo,
we're all salvage divers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all divers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We start talking diving and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had grown up around fucking
criminals, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wasn't tripping on the fact that
these guys were all criminals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the captain says to me, what did you
do before you went in the military?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked around and I was like,
the same shit you guys do, but at a
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, why did you stop?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, because I caught a case.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, and my whole neighborhood's
all doing the life.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call it life on the installment plan
where you basically you're in prison for
[SPEAKER_04]: two, you're out for three, you're in for
four, you're out for two, you're in for
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking three, you're out for two,
you're in for six.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of my partners ended up doing
this just a life of fucking incarceration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just said, I just didn't want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, herb is the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, it's way better.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, you don't want to be a diver.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to dive salvage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to work for the oil
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, you're a piece of fucking
hamburger to these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you want is you want to go back
to what you did before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, just trust me, the world will
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it caught me because I was far more
comfortable speaking to him honestly than
[SPEAKER_04]: I was anybody I worked with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the people that you're around in
your life, if you're raised in a criminal
[SPEAKER_04]: family where you learn not to fucking rat
as a little kid, and you're used to seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: relatives pull fucking robberies and shit,
and you're used to seeing stolen goods,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're used to having family members
in the newspaper for fucking shooting
[SPEAKER_04]: people, you're okay with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you go into the normal world,
it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, I can function mentally in that
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in terms of operationally,
it's so different, because our world is
[SPEAKER_04]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was more comfortable talking to the
team that was being raided than the guys
[SPEAKER_04]: that they had put me with to do the
rating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just it all clicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I got off of that mission,
and went back to Hawaii, I bought my first
[SPEAKER_04]: like plant science books, because I
started growing around 80.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 78, I start smoking, the neighborhoods
traffic and I get lucky in this weird way
[SPEAKER_04]: that my neighborhood was where all the
fishermen would go out into the bay and
[SPEAKER_04]: get the weed from all the boats.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shit, all the herb was being still
shipped in through vessel, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got to see quantity that was from
global from people that had their shit
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'd be able to tell you this is
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good batch usually comes in around
then when it comes in, we'll come by and
[SPEAKER_04]: grab you and we'll show it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got this crazy education from these
older criminals about quality drugs,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and they knew where the bales
were coming from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they would say, hey, this is
Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when the first indoor came out
in that early 80s out of Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 84, I think was the first time I saw
indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, whoa, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everything was, it was just
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you have this background.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I started growing in like 1980
with my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary, but I didn't have a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a brown thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I killed everything I touched.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I realized that I wanted to get
into cannabis, I only really understood
[SPEAKER_04]: like you grow it or you sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't understand the million things
that were going to emerge from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I said, all right, let me go get some
books.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started to study plant science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the day I got out of the military in
89, I used the government vehicle in
[SPEAKER_04]: uniform to go to Berkeley indoor garden to
go buy all my grow lights and spark up and
[SPEAKER_04]: open because I was ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love that place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fucking good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Victor was was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was at the time when you had to have
a driver's license to buy hydroponic
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment because they made you register
all your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I showed up in 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: Victor was still there, but I didn't have
to show ID.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, neither.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to either because it was this
weird thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked in the store the first time
because I just wanted to check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was in the service then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had a major plumbing leak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water was fucking spraying out of the
wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and because I had all this work on on
shipboard water and dewatering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I understand fucking water flow
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, hey, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I think I could just fucking fix
this for you while I'm here until you get
[SPEAKER_04]: a plumber to come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I shut it all down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was so happy that his store wasn't
get when he got fucked up that he
[SPEAKER_04]: remembered me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I came back, he had them put the
lights on his fucking tab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I came for it, but it was all
under Victor's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so at that time, I didn't have to worry
about, you know, the the follow through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I spark up in Oakland and my my
boy, Zell, who he's passed, but he was
[SPEAKER_04]: like older brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: He hooked me up with some of the Oakland
Hustlers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a Jamaican partner named Greggy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had another brother named Ricky and I
had this white chick named Sue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sue is where all the ultra high level
products were coming from, like out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendocino area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So through Sue, I got to see my first real
exquisite California outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was stunning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a pipeline to that through Ricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was good quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Greggy, same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both have really good access.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to have this killer group that I
could fuck with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I ended up tying in with this
dude named Alejandro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was trying to do business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Business with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was being filtered by this cat we
called Jailbird Pat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So me and Jailbird Pat were buddies,
but he was always in and out of the joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said to him, I said, listen,
I said, you're slowing down my fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you just sell me the contact?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just buy it from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me how much this fucking guy's phone
number is worth and then give it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll just go to the guy direct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So me and Pat worked out a deal on how
much the Kinect was worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I tie in to Alejandro.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I tied in to Alejandro, Alejandro was
tied right into the Mexican pipeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I started doing with Al was
having the people from Mexico come in to
[SPEAKER_04]: NorCal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would gather what I considered
really good commercial samples and we'd
[SPEAKER_04]: show it to them so they could understand
the quality level we needed to beat that
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it allowed us to start steering what
was moving into the building.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was pushing that shit into the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got it to a point where I only had
to work three days a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could do three days of work in the
Bay and then not come home for a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for a good year and a half,
I was only home for little touch points
[SPEAKER_04]: because I was busy fucking around as a
young dude with money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would go to the Bay, hook up with
Alejandro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd fucking tear it up in rage because he
was a fucking nut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had a warehouse that I rented.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we would go and put all
the units, crate everything up,
[SPEAKER_04]: get it set, fucking ship it out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all that barrier time, it was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so much of it was really the... And I
still hear those guys voice in my mind to
[SPEAKER_04]: this day, you need to go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm grateful because I think I would
have had a really good life doing what I
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would never have had the exposure to
so many diverse people.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I think that you can make money doing
a lot of shit, but being a cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: it touches so many different demographics
that it allows me to have this fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: network that's just absolutely
mind-bending to me that I'm touching
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are happy with nothing and
people who are worth $20 billion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're both cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, huge range.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that you have been in Afghanistan
last year or two years, like Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so inspirational for me in this
time that somebody from the cannabis high
[SPEAKER_03]: class people like you are directly goes to
Pakistan and does this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my privilege, my brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my privilege because this is the
real shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the real shit because I've been
traveling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now in my time, because I have little
kids and I'm a lone parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this time, I cannot travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stuck to the place because I have a
library of cannabis in the neighboring
[SPEAKER_03]: country, which is like a few meters away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is a privilege.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be with somebody that is down to earth
so much that he can still travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's interested in other cultures and
other perspectives and other kind of how
[SPEAKER_03]: you look at the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you give back to them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just going there and stealing
their genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't steal anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I rub some fucking feathers the wrong
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just because in life,
if you do what you do, you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't worry about being somebody who
pleases every single person with every
[SPEAKER_04]: action you do or you'll never fucking do
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like any time you do anything,
there's going to be an opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the stuff that was in cannabis was
when I was a kid and I started like I was
[SPEAKER_04]: a cannabis freak since I was 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea that I had this dream as a kid
that one day I would go to every cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: producing region on earth and I would just
get to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't I wasn't trying to do anything
profound.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted I just wanted to see the
world that built our world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the course of my life,
I kind of did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Pakistan was the you know,
the untouchable because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm American and like, holy fuck,
we nonstop war and conflict.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the Pakistanis reached out to me
and said, you know, we'd love to have you
[SPEAKER_04]: come over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, for what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what's what is it that you want me
to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, we really just want to
expose you to our world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully when you leave, you'll be
able to bring that good memory back with
[SPEAKER_04]: you and let other people know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their desire wasn't just cannabis
centric at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that which is was important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that cannabis was the vehicle,
the tool that was going to create the
[SPEAKER_04]: connection between us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what they want is they wanted to
be able to show Pakistan as a totality
[SPEAKER_04]: where when you went to the village to look
at the weed, how did the people treat you
[SPEAKER_04]: when you had food with the people after
looking at the weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did the people treat you while you
were looking for the weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the country like?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was such a elegant, beautiful
idea that the land race genetics team and
[SPEAKER_04]: let's be friends, Pakistan had that once
they laid it out to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: over the phone, I was like, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the irony is that as soon as I'm
getting ready to get on the plane,
[SPEAKER_04]: I get all these texts on my phone and I
still wonder if I still kept it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It opens up with they're going to cut off
your fucking head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm laughing because you're about to
get on a plane to go to Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are said either going to cut up
your fucking head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm cracking up and I'm like,
no, they're not going to cut off my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I don't think people catch is
that I go to all these odd fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: locations over the course of my career
that most would not go to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really learning about risk
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You learn how to weigh your odds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you live in the hustle and then
you do dangerous, deadly shit for a job,
[SPEAKER_04]: you start to kind of learn where you feel
safe and where you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you don't feel safe, you're
really pretty honest with why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you logically move yourself to a
position of surety where you say,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the odds are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll come back with my fucking head
attached to my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I didn't feel that, there's no
point in going because you're not there to
[SPEAKER_04]: be a martyr to get your fucking head
locked off on a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I knew was the people that I was
speaking with, they were really clear
[SPEAKER_04]: about their agenda and their agenda was to
highlight the beauty of a country through
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, once we started to really
talk, they weren't aware that there was
[SPEAKER_04]: this man in Humboldt named Douglas Fur.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Doug Fur is this local back to lander,
you know, 1968 gets here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the original back to land groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're raiding cannabis in like late
October then, because everything they were
[SPEAKER_04]: growing in California was what?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Southeast Asian, Mexican and
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: The broadleaf shit hadn't really come into
Cali until 7880.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when it really first started coming
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the impetus was if we can get plants
that finish a month earlier than the raid,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll have our crop out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Doug and his buddy, connect with a drug
dealer out of Eureka, who was Pakistani,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they fly to Islamabad and they travel
out to the Tira Valley and they gather the
[SPEAKER_04]: genes and then he ships that kilo back in
10 packages or 12 packages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And six of them arrived and six of them
didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So half a key, 500 grams a pound of seed
makes it to Doug direct into Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he did that was different than
anyone else that had received any Afghani
[SPEAKER_04]: lines, Pakistani lines, was he shared the
stock with the locals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it did is it kickstarted the
broadleaf revolution in our area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it lets people harvest on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get into that mid 80s zone
and indoor is on fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was those plants that could flower
under those conditions because the
[SPEAKER_04]: equatorials just don't thrive
commercially.
[SPEAKER_04]: In those situations, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So all these things line up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also lines up with where America
changed its desire of effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like America in the 60s and 70s was
looking to get high and spiritually
[SPEAKER_04]: uplifted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get into like 1980 when you get into
the Reagan era.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you take a look at drug usage and
general tone, you start to see that
[SPEAKER_04]: disparity between people who made money
rising up in the chart and people who were
[SPEAKER_04]: typically workers who made good money
dropping in the chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 1980 in America is like a critical date
because it's the change of the society's
[SPEAKER_04]: state of mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when you started to notice
cocaine and heroin re-explode and cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: mirrors these other drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went from having Thai weed,
Colombian and Mexican, which you can get
[SPEAKER_04]: on import into broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people didn't bitch that they weren't
getting their old type of high because the
[SPEAKER_04]: new consumers coming in felt weight on
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the end of the 70s America was a
shithole.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in hyperinflation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the Iranian issue where our embassy
had been seized.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had that debacle in the Vietnam War.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the public sees their country
negatively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of it, they see the world
negatively and it starts to change drug
[SPEAKER_04]: usage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I do is like to this day,
I look at what's taken place in the
[SPEAKER_04]: society around me and I use that to
interpret why the things that people
[SPEAKER_04]: consume popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's critical with drugs because it
mirrors it so clearly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it helps me understand trends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we in a trend that's rising?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it flat or is it declining?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it helps me understand genetic
development where is it worth getting into
[SPEAKER_04]: that direction or do I think it's going to
have a quick peak?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that time period was so tumultuous,
but it lets you kind of see these
[SPEAKER_04]: transitions from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we get into the 80s, the drug war
kicks in, the valuation explodes,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is worth a thousand in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes up in some cases, you know,
six.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the money pours in, it changes
completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Doug is a really nice down to earth
dude who still lives in a cabin,
[SPEAKER_04]: who still lives off grid and still makes
tea for you with a fucking like a propane
[SPEAKER_04]: torch, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea that I was going to get to go
to Pakistan and walk the ground that my
[SPEAKER_04]: friend walked just really caught me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I told the team in Pakistan,
I said, hey, we need to call this like the
[SPEAKER_04]: footsteps of Doug Furr.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all got caught up in it too where
we're like, they could understand what I
[SPEAKER_04]: was trying to do, which was start to
connect the dots so that we could tell the
[SPEAKER_04]: story so that people could see the
relevance and understand that a few people
[SPEAKER_04]: went to these countries and brought back
the genes that launched a $50 billion
[SPEAKER_04]: empire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people that gave us the seed stock
in all intents and purposes got fucked
[SPEAKER_04]: because they never made any long lasting
benefit from the relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we tried to do was recreate
the footsteps of Doug Furr.
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead of just Doug walking the Silk
Route into Pakistan, I wanted the Silk
[SPEAKER_04]: Route to extend into the United States and
let the Pakistanis walk into our lives
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, hey, I think I have an idea how
like we can frame it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it went really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they brought in a, you know,
team of people from Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They brought in my buddy Danny.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Greenwarris who does the,
you know, does the documentary work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he came in with John, who's a
filmmaker and our other partner,
[SPEAKER_04]: who's a filmmaker as well, who now does
major league baseball stuff, but in film.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they were able to capture so much,
like some of the footage that was
[SPEAKER_04]: captured, it's awe-inspiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what you got to do was look at not
just weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We traveled for 1300 miles through the
Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we're walking the Silk
Route.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're seeing the roads that the hominids
and Neanderthals merged on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're finding all this native cannabis
running wild in the mountains that humans
[SPEAKER_04]: are not playing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every village you went to had a crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every farmer was kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me just how it is to look at the
mountains there, you know, to see this
[SPEAKER_03]: magnificent, you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just explain the feeling, you know,
because I was in these places,
[SPEAKER_03]: not in this, but Mongolia I was,
but this is very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just so the environment has
so much impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in the mountains of Humboldt,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm on, I'm in, I'm in the Pacific
range and, and I've been to Colorado a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch and see, you know, and, and,
and seeing that type of elevation,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Pakistan was the first time I ever
really understood verticality where we
[SPEAKER_04]: were walking around 10,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you looked up, there was another
15,000 above you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you look down these canyons and there
was miles of distance to the, to the base.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you look up and there's miles above
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it, it helped me understand the
mountain culture similar as like all my
[SPEAKER_04]: partner, a lot of my good friends and like
what I call family are Polynesians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So Samoan, Hawaiian, Tokalawin,
Tongan, and that's boat culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were ancient navigators and sailors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sailed these massive outriggers
all over the ocean and just, but it's boat
[SPEAKER_04]: culture and boat culture is you learn to
shut the fuck up and work together or they
[SPEAKER_04]: throw you off the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's this teamwork type environment
because you have to be a team player on a
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking canoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out in the middle of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see that in many cultures because
we just don't have the need, but in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Kura Kura mountains, I saw it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I saw was that you had to be nice
to strangers because if you were a
[SPEAKER_04]: stranger in those places, you definitely
needed a way out of the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so massive that there, there's no
photos, no pictures until you see the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopper glacier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't quite catch what a glacier looks
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't realize it's an ice flow coming
out of a mountain and every little ripple
[SPEAKER_04]: in it is like 150 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fins that are on the top of these
things, you know, you're talking 10 story
[SPEAKER_04]: building ripples and massive moving
through these regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just made you feel so insignificant and
vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why were you at such an elevation?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no cannabis there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get off, like you go to the
coast, someone's at Karachi, you go down
[SPEAKER_04]: to the ocean part, it didn't go that far.
[SPEAKER_04]: We spent our whole time up in those Hindu
Kush, Himalaya, Kura Kura mountain range.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get into those, you're at base
elevation 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no cannabis growing at 10,000
feet, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure there is!
[SPEAKER_02]: At 10,000 feet, oh my God, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all this is coming at 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best sheep is coming from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the native herb, it was crazy looking
because when you get to see wild cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you get to see is these plants that
are built for survivability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is survivability for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much biomass, which would
technically rot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what you have is you have big giant
trikes on small bracts, small flower sets,
[SPEAKER_04]: but just insane aromas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you would just see anywhere where
there was water that deposited,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd see this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in your mind, you can see the people
moving across the Silk Route, eating
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, shedding it out, seed moving
around, animals eating seeds, shedding it
[SPEAKER_04]: out, people getting seed to eat and
dropping it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you realize that it was this massive
gene flow through this entire region.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's humbling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows you to understand that,
and everywhere we went, I asked every
[SPEAKER_04]: village, how long have you guys been
making hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: How long you've been working in your
family?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, well, we all got here 1,500
years ago, 1,800 years ago, 2,100 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone said the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Herb was here when we got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our families only know herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're talking to hash makers who when
you're talking to them, they're telling
[SPEAKER_04]: you the first memories I have as a child
is helping my dad beat hash in the shack.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their dad had beat hash and their
grandfather had beat hash for 2,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they held resin in their hands and
they moved it in their fingers,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was just so familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just helps you understand how much
we fucked up the entire education of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis because the drug war took all
this information out and removed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Kevin, do you mind describing some of
the terpenes that you were finding on the
[SPEAKER_00]: living cannabis up at 10,000 feet?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the most memorable ones
that you experienced there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what's funny is the wild
populations, you saw a myriad of aromas
[SPEAKER_04]: present because it was survival.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're talking about fixed
populations, and remember now,
[SPEAKER_04]: India doesn't do any culling of male or
female.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's total open population.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Pakistan and Afghanistan, they select
males.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they leave all the females.
[SPEAKER_04]: They select the males.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what they do is they go through the
males in the field and they leave the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that have the best characteristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not as a single planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one had great aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one had great survivability.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one right here had great flower set.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one had incredible rack size.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't go after... I was in a
discussion the other day about this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was about phenohunting and the idea
that cannabis, we phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, they don't do that in ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people say, yes, they do phenohunt in
ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most ag is in breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're hunting plants that are able
to reproduce on themselves, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: considered a perfect plant, you're finding
a plant, but it's through seed production
[SPEAKER_04]: and the genetic movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not just that single organism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis, we go through huge populations
to find a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is that you're having to
go through huge populations to find a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means as a breeder, you're not
doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's poor breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're not able to neck the traits
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you go into open pop, everything's
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'll see still patterns.
[SPEAKER_04]: With closed pop, you see what the farmers
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So each farm chooses the males they want
to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I noticed from my journals was
that the aromas matched the crops that
[SPEAKER_04]: were grown around them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we first come down into Naga
Valley, it's when you started to get into
[SPEAKER_04]: all the mangoes and fruits, because there
was more of apple and fruit that they were
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we start to go into the areas
where you add walnut and other types of
[SPEAKER_04]: nut tree, there was other profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the potato, other profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I journaled the whole thing
and then looked at the picture,
[SPEAKER_04]: like what was the big clusters,
what you had was you add what we would
[SPEAKER_04]: call the traditional earthy profiles that
we associate with broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get into what we would call
fuel here, but I also call it chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: But chemical that was turned up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean like hairspray that had been
blasted in your face and then lit on fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smells that were penetrating, like an acre
away from where you shook the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were like, whoa, the wind moved,
that stuff was coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was these really interesting
sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we noticed that around a lot of
the potato was those deep volatile
[SPEAKER_04]: sulfurs, which is septic tank,
rotting meat, decay, really heinous foul
[SPEAKER_04]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I didn't see in the hatch was any
fuel profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked them why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, with all this chemical and
fuel, why don't I see it in the product?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, because we off gas it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We allow the plants to sit at harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We let them sit out in the cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, and that process is doing
what?
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, it's letting us get a lot of
these other volatiles off the plant that
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't like as a consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, why don't you like that type
of effect?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, it was hysterical because
it was so honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, oh, we'll get too high and fall
off the mountain and die.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to explain this to somebody,
but like we were at the Hunza Inn,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is this killer spot in Hunza.
[SPEAKER_04]: And me and a bunch of the Pakistani
brothers went hiked up the mountain early
[SPEAKER_04]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like struggling to climb this
mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden it was time to go to
school for the kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these kids come skipping down the
mountain like a bunch of fucking goats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's old men carrying children on
their back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, like we're climbing,
like we're fighting for our lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys are skipping down this
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we find anybody falling,
you die.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're cracking up because they're so
acclimated to it, but they don't like to
[SPEAKER_04]: have reduced awareness because they just
know that you can't make mistakes in that
[SPEAKER_04]: type of situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they said, no, we gas all that off and
it opens up this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it was was it was happening with
hash that had, you know, like traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: hash that you almost never see with all
these subtle fruit and floral influences.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first time I seen a lot of
fucking hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen hash when they broke up a
chunk of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You thought you were in a fruit and flower
shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was because they had off gassed all
these other masking agents that they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: like as an impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it revealed all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was just really, it was a beautiful
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really hope that, and that's what we
tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we did because they did it
again last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just couldn't make it out because I had
my farm running.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were able to get people who saw
the trip, believe that it was a healthy,
[SPEAKER_04]: safe experience, went back with them on
the journey and they went over to some
[SPEAKER_04]: different regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: To where you start being able to bring
value to the people who are trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: bring value to the farms and the farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it starts to get us in cannabis in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: to realize for so many of us that we're
not, we're not the fucking like the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a chapter of the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the ones that have the best
internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't, we don't own the cannabis
world in any way, shape or form in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of like usage or knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really we're also like Australia
are the last on the fucking list.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Eastern Europe has had fucking herb in
it for six, 7,000 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only, only, you know, herb comes into
the United States, you know, through hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: in the areas when they had to create hemp
as rope.
[SPEAKER_04]: But drug cannabis really kind of comes
into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: in the 1900s for Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that begins the American smoking
culture and musicians and that Southern
[SPEAKER_04]: California feel instantly it gets
demonized by the media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's when they start to use marijuana
as a negative word.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always tell people if you take a
look at the paper in America and it tells
[SPEAKER_04]: you the Mexicans are going to take your
fucking jobs, realize that was the
[SPEAKER_04]: headline in 19 fucking 10 too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 1910, it said Mexicans are going to
steal your jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they realized that they could get the
blacks caught up in it too, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time we're talking,
you know, America's racist, like just
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out of the fucking slave area
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got these slave master mentality
running the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh, we can go fuck the
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a benefit, we can fuck the black.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they swept the black up and they use a
narrative to go against the black.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sweep the Mexican, go the narrative
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use marijuana as this derogatory
term.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all this usage of cannabis had nothing
to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the fact that the people that were
running the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: were fucking brutal racists and demonized
the substance to get an agenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when, you know, the industrial
cronies figure out the value of it and
[SPEAKER_04]: they realize it's a replaceable product
for petroleum, Hearst, who didn't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: lose the forests, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so Randolph Hearst is the
newspaper magnate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he has the ability to create anything
he wants in the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also the world's largest timber
holder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so hemp was a direct threat to
Hearst's timber fucking production.
[SPEAKER_04]: DuPont had just came out with nylon not
that long before.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, oh, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not losing this patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rockefeller was basically,
Rockefeller is a unique fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you really look at Rockefeller and
the way he was raised by his dad,
[SPEAKER_04]: where his dad tried to fuck him over every
day, him and all his brothers,
[SPEAKER_04]: the dad was trying to teach him how to be
ruthless, brutal businessmen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Rockefeller's background is just
fucking brutal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was the right guy to be brutalized
because he internalized that brutality and
[SPEAKER_04]: then exemplified it in his business
practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he gets broken up as a monopoly
by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: is when almost every oil company in the
United States is formed because he owned
[SPEAKER_04]: the fucking country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, fuck, his choke hold on oil was
similar to Hershey's choke hold on
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at one point in time in the U.S.,
I think like 95 percent of all chocolate
[SPEAKER_04]: sold was from Hershey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you have a control like that,
you know, it also takes a certain type of
[SPEAKER_04]: individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Rockefeller is just fucking lunatic to
me when you really look at the way he
[SPEAKER_04]: approached business and crack shit down
and switches into education, the
[SPEAKER_04]: educational system he switches to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's anti-cannabis, but it's also
anti-expression because what he wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: from the educational system was fucking
workers to work in the factories.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: educational system was developed,
and I'm not an educational expert,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like, I mean, you can read this shit,
was really developed to get people from
[SPEAKER_04]: agrarian lifestyle into factories.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you get people to work in a
factory?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to bring them in a building.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to let them piss on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to make them hold the hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put standardized information in front
of them that's designed to figure out
[SPEAKER_04]: who's good at running the job,
who's good at working on the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't fit into that window,
you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis to me was a drug that allowed
people to transcend the brainwashing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that was one of the
things that, you know, we really don't
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about in terms of why it was so
easily demonized by so many entities is
[SPEAKER_04]: that they realized that not only does it
compete with these products, but herb
[SPEAKER_04]: allows you to see people in a more human
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when it does bring a racist
together, when you're all smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not Mexican, black, Asian and
white.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just four people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that herbs ability to create
these these internal ties that bind based
[SPEAKER_04]: off of decent decency is a fucking problem
when you're trying to segregate nations so
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can have internal conflict.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we just use the Internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we just throw some shit on the net.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone loses their fucking minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nervous breakdowns.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like full on nervous break.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just like, wow, you're losing your
fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing in the rest of your
day?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so it's always been done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And herb is this substance that inherently
brings, I think, really nice traits out in
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what I wanted to be
able to do, like through those medical era
[SPEAKER_04]: was to get people to be able to benefit
from the plant and its totality,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though I barely understood it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had I just know that when you have
benefit derived by individuals with very
[SPEAKER_04]: little reciprocity required, meaning that
all they have to do is basically show up
[SPEAKER_04]: and be decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows you to make massive,
massive cultural changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and I had really no idea of the
totality of Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: This usage in terms of how it was used
historically, where I mean, fuck,
[SPEAKER_04]: like we knew it was a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like when you go to Pakistan,
every single farm has a field that they
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest for the seed for food and then the
resin for medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're and the seed is critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: They stack fucking bags of that shit up
because they need it for the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's it's a life saving food
source in their world for two,
[SPEAKER_04]: three thousand years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you try any dishes that were
specifically designed around cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, we ate cannabis seeds,
but they don't they don't have that same.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We weave all these things like and I would
say you have like bong and stuff in India,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's just the milk, milk drink that
you're and honey that you're drinking
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, it was they integrated the
smoking with the tea, with the prayer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the the the prayer was heavy where like
it because Pakistan is the most Muslim
[SPEAKER_04]: country in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you get to see people who are very
religious believers of their faith and and
[SPEAKER_04]: how they enact it and how they practice
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the prayer is just to stop and say
thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm insignificant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a it's a it's a moment of
humility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the tea is tranquility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the cannabis is is like uplifting
changes your tone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you'd notice through the course of
the day, the prayer, the tea and the smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: all kind of went together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they they wove it in in this really
seamless manner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was what was so fascinating was
that they had it with them for so long
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they didn't smoke flour, but I mean,
there's nobody we bumped into that didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a fucking ball of ash in their
pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I got to smoke a lot of fucking
good ash when I showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had half a key for us, so they had
five hundred gram fucking balls and then
[SPEAKER_04]: knew me.
[SPEAKER_04]: My partner knew me, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a fucking bag from Tira that was a
goat ball, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like goat ball ash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took the testicle ball sack off a
fucking goat and they because that's that
[SPEAKER_04]: was the original Ziploc bag.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So humans, whenever you see people
drinking water in the past, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: using like a goat skin that was sealed and
and they would carry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would drink out of the goat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we consider that shit just impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the reality was for thousands of
years you were drinking out of fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: goat skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the goat balls aren't fresh in the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been going for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the bag, because of the way it holds
the temperature and it also has microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: life, it interacts with the hash and it's
almost kind of like a semi ferment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've really I've had people from that
stuff, but I've never been over to like
[SPEAKER_04]: Malawi and try to Malawi Cobb in Malawi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never fermented a goat ball sack
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're doing something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, you know, you're cracking up and
you're like, I'm going to smoke the goat
[SPEAKER_04]: ball hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you're dying because we're
showing pictures of this shit and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: new people and cannabis are losing their
minds because nobody's wearing rubber
[SPEAKER_04]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't sterile and clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: How could these people survive?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, well, they've been
smoking this shit for fucking thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if there was a mob, we'd be dead
by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking kill it with fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was it was just really just so
pure and simple and humbling.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and the Muslim culture was
really interesting because I've never
[SPEAKER_04]: really been exposed to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way they approach visitors and
tourists and strangers was one of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolute reverence to the individual,
so no matter where I went, and so it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't orchestrated because we would
fucking travel 1300 miles, you can't bribe
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody for 1300 miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no matter where we went, the locals
that would bump into you were amazed,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially because because I'm fucking
white, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't see the white person in 20
fucking years, like maybe somebody sees
[SPEAKER_04]: people over like they wanted to touch you
and see if the shit was coming off your
[SPEAKER_04]: arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this journey of like, why are you
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, oh, I'm here to visit the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, and you're having a good
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I'm having a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it almost made them look that they
were going to cry because they wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: see the image of their country change.
[SPEAKER_04]: 9-11 fucked them up when we know Bin Laden
was in the caves when we went to war and
[SPEAKER_04]: did all that and that that wreaked that
havoc.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just destroyed the Pakistani economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many people had to leave the
country to go find survival and success.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also are Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so years later, they can look back at
their country and say, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_04]: how do we do something for our native
home?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was how Land Race Pakistan and
Let's Be Friends Pakistan kind of came
[SPEAKER_04]: into existence was grown men who were
sharp, who are Pakistani by descent,
[SPEAKER_04]: who wanted to be able to do something
positive for their country and their
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could tell the purity of the the
desire from the way you were treated and
[SPEAKER_04]: the way everyone around them was treated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just it was a beautiful,
beautiful experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was 10 times greater than I
thought it was going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had dreamt of walking in Pakistan my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that you filmed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that film, is it being produced or is
it already released?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not in control of the film by
Danny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny's team did all the film work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he releases clips.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I believe at some point, you know how
it is when you do film, it's the editing
[SPEAKER_04]: that's brutal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you when you when you you say like a
podcast, when you got to cut, you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: cut and clip and break and then and then
put it all together in a form that allows
[SPEAKER_04]: people to want the the sit down time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Raul.
[SPEAKER_04]: They brought drones and the drone footage
is absolutely awe inspiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the quality of the footage that they
took.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Nat Geo level shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Raul's a really, really talented
filmmaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is John.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's read films online and he just got an
award for his his short.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd been doing some like horror shorts
and he's doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a talented young guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you had and Danny Danny's
infection.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just with his enthusiasm for what he
does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what you had was you had a really
good like media team capturing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know at some point it'll come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we've tried to do is just
basically any time they release a clip,
[SPEAKER_04]: then we just all network up to push it out
so people can get a view of these regions
[SPEAKER_04]: in a way that you normally can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there some of these clips on your
Instagram or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say go to GW Smoke Break.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then and then there's if you go over
to what I'll do, too, is I'll share you
[SPEAKER_04]: over a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send me the link later and I'll
add to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the guys that we were with there is
a professional photographer, really
[SPEAKER_04]: talented.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the stuff you see me sharing
all the time, that's him sending me
[SPEAKER_04]: footage of him exploring Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just told the guys, I said,
yeah, let's just create this this window
[SPEAKER_04]: so that people who want to see something
beautiful can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did the collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gathered up all the stock for him and it
was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to do it as a team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was talented Pakistanis,
Europeans and myself all looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: outliers out of all these fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was able to get the chunk of
the collection sent back and I was able to
[SPEAKER_04]: give it out and provide it to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I brought a bunch of it to the high T,
but I gave it out all over the place so
[SPEAKER_04]: that people could get access to things
that you normally can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get to experience a world that
doesn't exist today in terms of flavor
[SPEAKER_04]: profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gives you what I always call like
new paint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you new paint to be able to work
on things that are existing and work like
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll use like the Oreo clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Oreo clone is probably one of the
best plants you could ever grow in every.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grows well, but it's kind of bland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it has.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible agronomic qualities,
but it's kind of like Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple Punch is a sexy, sexy girl,
but she's got no flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Purple Punch has no flavor,
but I think Oreos is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Oreos is underappreciated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Oreos as a light smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we looked at it as a.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the market look at it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bigger picture than just being you low on
the appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a lot of stuff people don't like,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do is we use those products that
carry such incredible traits and then we
[SPEAKER_04]: repaint them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when your house looks like shit,
you don't burn it the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just repaint it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's the way you
approach genetics is that what we've done
[SPEAKER_04]: now is we've steered towards agronomics
and COAs more than we've steered towards
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, because the vast number of
people who shop shop off of price and
[SPEAKER_04]: potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the metrics of purchase of price
and potency, the majority and I say
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody does it, but now the fucking
majority do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That changes what fits into the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're trying to pitch money to
build an operation, you got to let these
[SPEAKER_04]: people know you're going to get 100 grams
per square.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get it every 62 days or
they don't give you the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you commit to this process,
you're kind of stuck in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it does, it only there's only so
many cultivars that give you 29 percent in
[SPEAKER_04]: 62 days that the market will take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the buyer has to be able to put
it on Instagram, too, or otherwise it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not fucking real.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you take all these new varieties that
have been steered and pushed and you bring
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the vigor, you bring back in an
outcross from separate genes, genes that
[SPEAKER_04]: are completely unrelated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get, in my opinion, a degree of
like semi-heterosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a higher level of vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not true F1 because they're not
inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your line and this line isn't inbred,
but genetically, they're as fucking far
[SPEAKER_04]: apart as you get.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it does, it allows you to start
to see what the things from Pakistan
[SPEAKER_04]: impart to the things that we have now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I use these tools over the last
couple of years, you know, what I get out
[SPEAKER_04]: of it almost always is a way better water
usage where the plant only has to water
[SPEAKER_04]: half as often as it did prior.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the uptake mechanism changes
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get an ability to produce at a lower
food load.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plants have been built on lower
humus levels because really it's this this
[SPEAKER_04]: calcium rich, sandy, I say sandy loam,
but it's like sandy loam is clay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this gritty man.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil is gritty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all it's all glacier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So very little biological matter to give
you nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get it from animal deposition when
they take the fields and compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: But where is all your biological material
that's going to break down and form it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plants adapt to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also see better cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also see profiles that we just don't
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ability to create a profile that's
a chokey sulfur that when you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_04]: that shit is grabbing you and shaking you
like a dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're not going, oh, I'm going to
take another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to find oxygen in the room
and your nose and your mouth is you're
[SPEAKER_04]: running.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of stuff is like old school
experience when you're a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what I get out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get out of the hybridization using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I do pure preservation where I take
and if you're doing preservation for
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that's like this, you really need
like 10,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that these aren't true
preservations.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're steered preservations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least we're holding something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're able now to be able to connect
like the farmers of Ghazni, Afghanistan to
[SPEAKER_04]: people in Oregon, the farmers from Nagar
Valley, Pakistan to the people in southern
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that this is where this came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the ability for you to use it as a
tool is critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only way that you can really hold
things is in seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're holding cologne,
the idea of holding cologne forever,
[SPEAKER_04]: do that shit your whole life and tell me
that's how you want to spend your whole
[SPEAKER_04]: life where you never endingly have a
fucking house full of plants that are
[SPEAKER_04]: priceless, that must be tended
continuously.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times you going on vacation?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times you it's like I've been
doing my whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what got me into commercial nursery
work is what we got me into cryo banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what the basis of the grateful head
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this idea that I just fucking do not
want to hold plants at scale personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can ask one stuff, but you're
having the fucking genetic and something
[SPEAKER_04]: is fine when we're doing we're steering
for production needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to create breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for preservation, you want as much
gene pool as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I learned from the Pakistanis and
the Afghanis, and I also learned it from a
[SPEAKER_04]: redwood propagator, which really changed
my view of preservation was that you have
[SPEAKER_04]: to make selection, but you have to include
as much as material as possible because
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't know where the alleles that are
needed for resistance in a problem in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future live.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you start to narrow a line,
it's kind of like genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's accidental.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetic drift is where you and I are
breeding a project and we have traits of
[SPEAKER_04]: interest that are our focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the course of the project,
we lose focus and we start to move the
[SPEAKER_04]: selection away from those original
selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens over the course of so
many years is the thing that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: working with is the same gene pool,
but the traits that you wanted are no
[SPEAKER_04]: longer present.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit isn't in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people like you can take anything and
get anything out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, you fucking can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that shit's not present anymore because
in the gene transfer and movement of the
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding it left, it's not present.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we want to be able to do is have
as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way the Pakistanis worked it is
even if they have let me get this plug in
[SPEAKER_04]: so we don't lose power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they had their favorite plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't just use the favorite plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just threw in one or two more
handfuls of seed into the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every female yielded seeds,
but they would just always throw a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more of their favorite shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had a little more of their
favorite shit cycling through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what they know is that when you make a
mistake with agriculture and you focus on
[SPEAKER_04]: agronomics and you don't focus on
survivability, what you get is fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: starvation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was this really, really clear
picture where for the first time I could
[SPEAKER_04]: see it in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the same with sharing genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No farmer hoarded anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your neighbor wanted your shit,
they got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was better genes in Afghanistan
and similar regions, they brought it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody hoarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each person, every village, I'm like,
what's your lines?
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, oh, we have we have just common
gene pool and we share and we always try
[SPEAKER_04]: to steer towards best diversity,
best outcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why this is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in this kind of cultures,
everybody relies on the neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody relies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the survival in these regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot survive without being,
you know, normally this is not the Western
[SPEAKER_03]: culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Western culture means like you have
your door closed and locked down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in these cultures, like also my
culture was like this in Yugoslavia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even now we don't have our door locked.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a very different culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions this way, this way, because all
those we're just running on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're similar to Michael
Wolf Siegel that you talk and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, for us, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just sitting on the couch listening
to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when I want to ask a question,
I realize I should probably just shut up
[SPEAKER_02]: because if I say anything, I'm just going
to throw you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost him again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to technical difficulties,
we had to stop the recording here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we got back on a week later.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode will be continued next week.
