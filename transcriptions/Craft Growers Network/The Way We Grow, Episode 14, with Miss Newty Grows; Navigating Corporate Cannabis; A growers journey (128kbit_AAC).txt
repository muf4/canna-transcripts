[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast, a production of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Nick Wolf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, our guest is Genevieve,
also known as Miss Nudie Grows on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genevieve, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful sunny day here in Eastern
Canada, and the snow is melting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out in western US and Oregon,
and it is a dreary Oregon day out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm jealous of the sun, actually,
but it's probably a little colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little colder, but we do get a bit
more sun in the wintertime, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: than you folks out there, just based on my
experience in BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's anything like Seattle,
then it's dreary and grey all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fun fact is when I turned 40,
which was almost seven years ago now,
[SPEAKER_01]: my treat to myself, it was 2018 in
California, had just become recreationally
[SPEAKER_01]: legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went down there for 420 to San Francisco
with my Jeep that I currently have now,
[SPEAKER_01]: rented a pod, threw it in the back,
drove up to Victoria from Edmonton,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's where I was living,
and then down the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon became one of my favorite places,
and I definitely want to go back there,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was just driving down that
coastal highway through Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drive through Oregon is a lot nicer,
in my opinion, than the drive through
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Highway 1, or I think it's
sometimes 101.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get them confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I didn't say it, because I've
only been down it once, so I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: act like a pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lived here my whole life,
and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The parts in California can be kind of
treacherous along some of those extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: hairpin turnbacks through the hilly
mountainside there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all sheer cliffs and stuff,
and I always get almost like a panic
[SPEAKER_03]: attack driving through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot like BC, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through at night to the big
redwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, you come up right up to
one, and you can literally, if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: paying attention, go right into it,
which I'm sure happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's new in your grow world?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that for a while there,
I'm not sure if you're still working with
[SPEAKER_03]: the same commercial facility, but you kind
of went from a home grower to a commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: grower in somewhat rapid succession,
very close to around the same time that I
[SPEAKER_03]: did personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fascinating to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's new in your grow world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been exciting from what I hear to
watch, but also to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quickest recap would be, pre-2018,
I was a social worker working in the city
[SPEAKER_01]: of Edmonton in Alberta, which is on the
western side of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of hobby growing and blasting into
the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much that I moved into corporate
cannabis, so jumped around in Alberta at a
[SPEAKER_01]: few spots, and then was transplanted out
here for a really good opportunity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and did that thing for a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a crash course in corporate
cannabis, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was managing B2B sales, not just
domestically, but internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped basically mold and bring that
team from, we were just little weaklings,
[SPEAKER_01]: to like all the way up into all the best
provinces in Canada as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So BC and Ontario with a craft grower
designation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose that Fino that was winning awards
around Canada, the Daily Grape,
[SPEAKER_01]: and pretty much made the cultivation
department what it is, that Daily Grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that we had other partners so I
was managing other micro-cultivation sites
[SPEAKER_01]: across Canada, so as far as BC,
so western to eastern allies, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout Atlantic Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I moved out here, I got to travel
everywhere in Atlantic Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a really cool experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did resign from that position at the end
of last year because I was really burnt
[SPEAKER_01]: out, and that I just needed to recognize
that I'm an older lady, gonna be 47,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I know and recognize those signs
and symptoms, and I pushed through it for
[SPEAKER_01]: a good year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, built out that cultivation
and post-harvest department, it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: A grower's success really is when you
can't grow enough of the product that the
[SPEAKER_01]: people want, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a problem in itself, but that was
the biggest problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, I passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got down to the young man that I was
mentoring, and he does amazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what I'd like to do
continually, is just find another spot
[SPEAKER_01]: where I can learn things for myself,
so I do have a specific list of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'd like to experience at scale,
and make a little bit of money this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working strictly for passion,
and honestly, the industries, the best
[SPEAKER_01]: word I can use is raped it out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My creativity, just a lot of things were
intellectual property, just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: really learn lessons as you come up and in
through any probably fast-paced,
[SPEAKER_01]: ever-changing industry with so many
transient people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies I worked for don't even
exist in Alberta.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was only a few years ago,
so it's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds a lot like the restaurant
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of people compare it to that
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work in hospitality and
restaurants in the city of Edmonton,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a huge, over-a-million-people
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough, at Atlantic or East Coast
bars, and I wasn't even from the East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast, but now this is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like money is the number one thing,
and it's ever-changing and over-regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working in the bar industry and
serving industry when the rules were still
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more lax, and it was a little
bit more fun, and there was culture to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this and that, and then it started
getting over-regulated, and I dipped out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so coming back into that corporate
scene has been a little bit trying at
[SPEAKER_01]: times, but you have to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you do is you learn to work with that
type of mindset and those types of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a chef for like 10 years and worked
on the West Coast and the East Coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I feel like there's a lot of
similarities because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: passion within the people that want to get
into those industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of glamour as well in the
restaurant industry, bar industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the industry events, like you
probably know, that would get put out,
[SPEAKER_01]: red carpet events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're very glamorous, and I feel
like a lot of people think that by working
[SPEAKER_03]: hard or working with the right people that
they're going to be the next sensation,
[SPEAKER_03]: or have some sort of big payout from just
being raked over the coals consistently
[SPEAKER_03]: for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if you work towards those
accolades, sorry for cutting you off,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is real steaming about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work towards those accolades,
for example, and win Top Grower 2023 in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, people don't give a shit in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either telling you you're paying
to play, which I didn't because I'm poor
[SPEAKER_01]: as F, and so is the company, or you don't
deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, what do I need to show
you to prove that I deserve this award?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not based on just growing good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on leadership and other skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's just because I'm a
female, but these accolades just get
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've won awards for my strains and my
phenohunting Canada-wide and in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Brunswick and in Alberta when it was
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was winning Home Grow awards,
but people just don't care, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't usually mention them except on
podcasts to validate myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it is important to bring up
what you were saying there is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, accolades.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like so much more to it at this
point now where you have to be like
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing yourself and doing it in a very
specific way to follow whatever people are
[SPEAKER_03]: like wanting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that kind of reduces the, you know,
like the essence of why you're doing it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the first place, almost to like to meet
these demands of the consumer and the
[SPEAKER_03]: public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not necessarily sustainable for
like a mental state or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: even just like doing what you want to do
or doing it because you have like the
[SPEAKER_03]: passion for it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be muddied very quickly that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, yeah, it's, it's hard to,
you know, if you're chasing awards and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, it doesn't, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to stay authentic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm hearing because there's no
payoff for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what the people say they
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've provided it, but there hasn't
been much reward, whether it's the reward
[SPEAKER_01]: is likes or engagement or pay,
money would be nice, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it just hasn't been rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you scale back on that naturally as a
creator because you want to get paid or
[SPEAKER_01]: you want some sort of win-win.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's happening really fast too,
where it's like almost, and I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be associated as an influencer either,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's dangerous ground too with all
these different documentaries coming
[SPEAKER_01]: about, not even cannabis related,
but you know, like I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: influence other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm just trying to portray or show
authentic life, you know, just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are the struggles of trying to get
through this corporate world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we do at the job that I'm
at wherever that job is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before this job, I was dancing in rooms
with plants in a vertical spot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like I'm looking for the,
I guess, the next place to go dancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do, I've started to get some
interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have been looking at outdoor
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so relocation will probably be in my
near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next couple of years, I've turned down
a couple of things already that just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: align.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you've been in the industry,
even though it's only been six years,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a small short, I guess, what am I
trying to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a small industry, but it's a it's
a baby still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been around that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the industry is really young.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the word I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, I guess I want to make sure
that, yes, I'm jumping back into corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but I want to make sure that
it's going to be something that I can also
[SPEAKER_01]: put some passion into as well.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if that's, I feel like everyone
has their own sort of drive for what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're desiring in a position if it's
for, you know, the unfortunate
[SPEAKER_03]: capitalistic means that we all are
currently surviving off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if there's like part of it
where, you know, if you love what you do,
[SPEAKER_03]: you won't work a day in your life is what
I've heard time and time again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is some truth to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then also, you know, like we've talked
about earlier, there is a lot of potential
[SPEAKER_03]: for people being taken advantage of if
they are like highly passionate for a
[SPEAKER_03]: position and will sometimes, you know,
do anything it takes to get into an
[SPEAKER_03]: industry or a position because they feel
like they need to get their foot in the
[SPEAKER_03]: doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you said there where you're still,
you're turning down positions because you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to make sure it's the right fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people should take note on that
because that's a very important thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: know your worth as a grower, especially in
an industry that's going to take advantage
[SPEAKER_03]: of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the possibility, if the opportunity
arises.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so guarding yourself against that is
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're what I'm noticing the shift and
it's good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shift that's happening in in
corporate cannabis cannabis is good for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to look for leaders and
managers and head growers that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to manage teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's been probably my biggest
success is that I had a background
[SPEAKER_01]: previous to this interview industry where
I was managing, you know, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of thousands of caseloads of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So managing is is something that I'm
really good at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so before, though, there's so many
loudmouth, you know, men and women,
[SPEAKER_01]: but mostly men that were like promising
the world to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing for 30 years like yet a
classic, you know, and didn't follow
[SPEAKER_01]: through and have a follow through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the last place I was at, I was coming
in like the sixth person after five men
[SPEAKER_01]: that just didn't want to get on the floor
with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three to four years later,
that's still what CEOs are coming to me
[SPEAKER_01]: for, saying like, hey, we're looking for
that manager that's wanting to get on the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor with the plants and and manage the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we that's what's wrong with this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're an American podcast,
but it might be similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we usually are following right behind
the trends there and the culture in all
[SPEAKER_01]: these facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it's profit over people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's no longer craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As my mentor, Kevin Jodry would say,
it's quality over profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people, if you go on Indeed and see
the reviews for a lot of these places,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're taking note of that and they
need to switch that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of leaders like me and a
lot of them are female that know what to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, have more empathy, I guess,
can work with the young people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a very young industry,
but it's young people that are in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to be, like I said,
forty seven, but I'm more rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's I'm working with 19 to 30
year olds generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a different generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is it's really interesting to see an
emerging industry that has this legacy
[SPEAKER_03]: market and groups of legacy growers who
like to use the term master grower or
[SPEAKER_03]: expert gardener or some of these terms
that kind of are there to almost inflate
[SPEAKER_03]: the ego rather than to provide an
explanation of what their capabilities
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing that a lot of those
people that are trying to maintain
[SPEAKER_03]: standards in this industry as the price
continues to drop, as labor prices
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to go up, as the overhead cost
and the the cost per goods, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything is going in the wrong direction
for profits to go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to have people who care about the
plant as well as make wanting to be there
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure that the people that are
taking care of the plant are also taken
[SPEAKER_03]: care of is extremely important because
most industries fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the if they don't take care of the
workforce, especially when there is so
[SPEAKER_03]: much labor required within agriculture in
general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these places are 100 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that not agriculture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in even in small like boutique
farms for, you know, farmers market style
[SPEAKER_03]: farms where they're small enough to keep
things, you know, maybe they do one style
[SPEAKER_03]: of crop or they only do a small amount per
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still fairly craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at cannabis as
comparable to the agricultural market in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, then you start to see that these
these differences in scale do end up
[SPEAKER_03]: prioritizing difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: They prioritize things differently where
you can be small and you can prioritize
[SPEAKER_03]: the workers because that means that the
workers are going to prioritize the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of the product because they feel
like they're being taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's this reciprocity
there, whereas if you're in a very large,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, hundred acre or, you know,
giant greenhouse facility or some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: massive, you know, multi hundred light
room indoor facilities and you have these
[SPEAKER_03]: these teams of workers that are trying to
accomplish all these different tasks,
[SPEAKER_03]: but are constantly being marginalized
because the, you know, the overhead keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: going up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was saying, the price per pound
keeps dropping and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone wants a raise each year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really hard to keep up with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so sometimes I've seen a lot of places
have the policy of like either up or out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you either need to continue to rise
up and provide a better like a better
[SPEAKER_03]: worker.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the company, or you should go find
work elsewhere because we need to hire new
[SPEAKER_03]: people that are cheap enough to maintain
the just the amount of bodies that need to
[SPEAKER_03]: be thrown at a task.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like de-leafing or
transplanting, a lot of these things are
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly simple to understand and to get
really good at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't have someone doing that who
is making a whole lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's where I feel like you have like
craft farms versus these massive
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's just a different
requirement and the labor and having
[SPEAKER_03]: someone with your understanding of how,
you know, humans work, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you're going in there to make sure
that they feel heard and understood and
[SPEAKER_03]: cared for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also understanding how the plants
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can have that sort of like
it's almost like a parental nature,
[SPEAKER_03]: it feels like, where you have to be like
guiding, but firm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have to make sure that the stuff
gets done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to make sure that they
understand that, listen, I know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, we're all tired today, but we got to
get through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, tomorrow we'll have a
more chill day and we can go over some
[SPEAKER_03]: more fun practices and learn some new
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a balance and not everybody has the
patience, I think, for that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll just bump us right up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be floating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it does remind me a lot of
kitchens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing that if you have a good
reputation for doing certain things,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're still going to be relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when I quit, I've been off for
six, six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I left, I was like,
oh shit, like I can't be off for too long
[SPEAKER_01]: because I need to stay relevant coming off
of like a big win and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last six months, I have been doing
a lot of back to my roots home growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm still like having some genetics
that I've had for a long time and just
[SPEAKER_01]: like really dialing them back in and like,
maybe as you know, you might neglect your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants at home because you're giving all
your love and passion to the plants at
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I noticed that when I had the time
off my plants outside, we're just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to pop off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was August.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best, the best outdoor I've ever had
was last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built a bunch of hugel bed boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing that since I started,
you know, in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing in the city of Edmonton when
it was illegal in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just not that long really since 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each year outdoor growing is like
fabulous out east, fabulous out east
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to sort of where I was before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the tent growing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I popped a few new seeds and I have
been trying to grow sacred tobacco for
[SPEAKER_01]: offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last six months, my partner in crime,
Katrina Jackson, we sort of developed a
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're not incorporated or anything
yet, but you know, it's hard to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: delve into consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't feel honestly ready for it
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have more experience to gain and
I'm ready to go get that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a few more years out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, Katrina's got a whole
side that compliments my cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: skills and experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's doing product development and
some of the products she's developed for
[SPEAKER_01]: the Canadian market have and are still top
selling products, topicals, 2.0 products,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were working in some indigenous
communities out here in New Brunswick
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to, I guess, get some workforce
going on out in those communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing the youth back onto the
reserves by offering them like a cool
[SPEAKER_01]: place to work, like a weed facility,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on the fact that there is some
funding money out there for indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: communities and things like harm
prevention or like what I just said,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing the youth back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought, wouldn't it be a cool
idea to help the community build their own
[SPEAKER_01]: production facility so they can
manufacture their own sacred products for
[SPEAKER_01]: sovereign ground or jump into the legal
industry really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's two separate ones out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be something that I'd love
to keep doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it's like relying on
government grants and funding and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just so not stable.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairly sporadic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the money does come, you almost
have to be there at the front of the line,
[SPEAKER_03]: snapping it up as quick as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did get lucky enough to sort of
collaborate with the doctor, Dr. Shelley
[SPEAKER_01]: Turner, who's like an addiction specialist
physician out here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been working with people trying to
get, or has successfully gotten people off
[SPEAKER_01]: opiate therapies like Suboxone and things
like that to cannabis treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still going to work on that and
try to pursue that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you know,
it's time to get back to work and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: real job and like put that stuff to the
side for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like we've had a really nice
sort of like catch up to where you are
[SPEAKER_03]: right now in terms of what you're looking
to do next and make some moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like to find out sort of where
the passion started and where the interest
[SPEAKER_03]: in plants started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like all the way back, what were
some of the first experiences with plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that you had, whether it be cannabis or
otherwise?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if if it was cannabis,
that was kind of your first interest in
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, then how did that potentially
evolve into vegetable gardening or
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if it was perhaps some like vegetable
gardening with mom and dad or grandma or
[SPEAKER_03]: grandpa?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if it went from there into
cannabis, let's hear the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my grandpa, we used to spend like parts
of the summer with him and he had always
[SPEAKER_01]: had this big garden in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were always my sister and I were
always helping him back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like early on really had a good
connection with with plants and just like
[SPEAKER_01]: a basic understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was an avid gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also growing up and but I was kind of too
cool for gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my dad was always trying to get me
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just like gardens, a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's weeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I wasn't grasping the
connection piece or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really just like didn't do
anything until I owned my own home in
[SPEAKER_01]: Edmonton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the domestic thing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I own my own home,
I was like, I should have a garden because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just what people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like so I called it like hate gardening at
first because it was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way harder than I expected it to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually had to like learn about the
vegetables that I was planting and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about what they shouldn't be next to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I started learning more about
each thing, I really started getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: trees and I had just had a lot of fruit
trees in my backyard for being in a city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was learning about pruning and
probably did like 10 years of just sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: practicing in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like every year I'd grow new flowers
because flowers are hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone's tried to grow
like, you know, flowers that you just get
[SPEAKER_01]: in the in the greenhouse place,
just like you grow vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers take longer to germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, it depends, but they can be
tougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just looked at weed as another
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just another chemically complicated
flower, but it was still a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hadn't really just decided to grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I started to grow weed was
because I started to need it in abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got really sick back in like 2015,
2016, and it ended up being colitis and
[SPEAKER_01]: like just some ulcer stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lost a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going through a lot at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been sober from drugs and alcohol
for four years at that time, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four years, like abstaining from
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to treatment for cocaine and booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddies were telling me to like,
you know, smoke cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to help you with your stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, no, like back then,
like even 2016, I mentioned it to my
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, whoa, like,
no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a psychiatrist at the time because
like I was really well wrapped in
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment and, you know, maintaining and
doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's hard to stay sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure people know addictions
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my psychiatrist who is really helping
me along with like, I also have ADD,
[SPEAKER_01]: ADHD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know, enjoying to keep
going with her, but she cut me right off
[SPEAKER_01]: when I admitted to using drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was using cannabis to treat my stomach
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is that the doctor,
the gastro people were trying to give me
[SPEAKER_01]: like chemo meds and things like that and
things that I was more scared of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: addicted to, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, they just make you really dopey
and out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was still just abstaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I believe it was Christmas time
or I know it was Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just desperate and my buddy was
like, here, smoke this, like enough's
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did and it changed my life forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That night, even I felt a little bit of
hunger, like appetite, like to not have an
[SPEAKER_01]: appetite and be chronically nauseous for a
year is I was suicidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the start of when I started to
heal my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went into the system to try and get a
legal prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really hard to navigate as
somebody who didn't, wasn't legacy or
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had a drug dealer, of course,
but it was like a nice guy that I trusted
[SPEAKER_01]: in the social work biz.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did it on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know any like black market
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did eventually get my two grams a day
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember taking almost a year to
convince this fricking doctor to let me
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow my own because it was costing so
much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, yeah, 2016, 2017 at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was pre-legalization here in Canada,
but there's still a long medical history
[SPEAKER_01]: here since the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just trying to navigate sort
of the end of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was difficult at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that the cannabis clinic
that I was attached to that I was referred
[SPEAKER_01]: to from my doctor was actually owned by
Aurora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as a consumer, you don't know that
these clinics are owned by these big,
[SPEAKER_01]: huge corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they're pushing you in that
way to you can only buy these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the time you have to get a
prescription for one licensed producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd kind of go through the rules of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually I navigated that system for
about a year and it was so expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: like $700 a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to get what I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I was infusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fun fact is I started educating the
community on YouTube in maybe 2017,
[SPEAKER_01]: 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look back, it's a lockdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're embarrassing so I barely go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But infusing, that was my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2016, which is only eight and a
bit years ago, you couldn't get any
[SPEAKER_01]: information from anybody's grandma or
anybody about how to get weed butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to figure it out yourself or know
somebody that knew what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did the whole butter with water with
like, oh, I went through so many gross
[SPEAKER_01]: things that it made my friends eat because
it would get you high, but it tasted
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad or didn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was sort of my jam then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was going through a lot of weed
infusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started like delving into the,
the unregulated market a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: selling my edibles and my infusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it did eventually get really good at
it and kind of dwelled into CBD because at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time my dog had been diagnosed with
epilepsy, a really severe type of epilepsy
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone had recommended CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus you didn't even know what you were
buying back then, unregulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I decided to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the very first CBD that I ever grew was
called Candida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was popular at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest CBD on it was something like
90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was considered a hemp variety
because the THC was under 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually won an award with that Candida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the highest CBD in the comb grower
competition that I was enrolled in at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time through hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD is something that I still continue
to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a Deadlights now, which is sub
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really awesome strain of CBD as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the closest thing I found since I had
the Candida that I had that I lost a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just, I guess just really
getting into pop, popping off is the word
[SPEAKER_01]: I use for educating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether that was teaching people how to
infuse, I just really wanted to give back,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to, to help what I found hard to
find for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those videos got some pretty
good traction at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't monetize on anything now
because it's away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 10K.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nothing now, but also because I was
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all age restricted and it's
just old news.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old days, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we still will even put that our
content that we make isn't made for kids
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's so many different laws
and, you know, depending on if it's Canada
[SPEAKER_03]: where you have to be 18 or the U S where
you have to be 21.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, you know, there's still a
huge stigma.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just try to protect ourselves as
best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought up a lot of memories with
making cannabis butter and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and my partner would always make it
using a crock pot water and butter and
[SPEAKER_03]: the, you know, all the extra trim or we
use like a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like all the pre-vaped weed just goes
right into it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have not found one way that
someone's mentioned that I haven't tried
[SPEAKER_01]: to either decarb or infuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've done milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done like keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can put keef in anything like,
and it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good recipes because it wasn't
anything that I was told by that magic
[SPEAKER_01]: butter machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just using them as an example,
they're a great machine, but by trial and
[SPEAKER_01]: error.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just knowing and feeling what works
best for me really, like I still have
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated clients that want my CBD oil
and my gummies because they are most
[SPEAKER_01]: effective for them just based on probably
the way I infuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we, we make fudge with the butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can just stick fudge in the
fridge and it lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, like we're having like
little tiny pieces, like quarter,
[SPEAKER_03]: quarter of an inch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're just so small and because
it's, it's so potent, but I don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't really find that on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everywhere has like regulations on the
THC, um, like the grams of THC or the
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams of THC that can be in the
edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, you're making me eat
a whole bunch more sugar than I want to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get the same results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of my colitis, I have a sugar
cap, like literally it will send me into a
[SPEAKER_01]: puking fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go above say like 18 grams in one
serving, which is not hard to hit because
[SPEAKER_01]: a pop has like 50, I could never have a
pop or I'd start vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, those edibles are not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I couldn't even have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I don't like is a lot of
regulated and unregulated edibles on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market are distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not a super big fan of distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I like a full flower effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's harder to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my stuff is always just like,
it's the guts, it's everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I, I like, we'll always make the
butter now with stuff that's like been
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting for a year or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always, you know, fully oxidized,
like extremely old cannabinoids that have
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly converted into whatever their final
form is going to be already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll, I'll decarb it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit, but sometimes I just
will let the crock pot go for like 24
[SPEAKER_03]: hours and I'm like, yeah, that's,
that's enough heat to decarb it all the
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the kind of, uh,
that's how I make my death brownies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's why it's such a small
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what I want, but it's happened
before because yeah, exactly the old stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even really need to decarb it
cause it's already oxidized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And degraded into CBN and then yeah,
it just hits you so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: A funny story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, maybe like 10 or 15 years ago,
I had done just that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: used a bunch of old weed and made butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I made, um, rainbow rice crispy
treats with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I cut the squares into what I would
think people would want to eat for a rice
[SPEAKER_03]: crispy treat, not thinking about how much.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC and, uh, cannabinoids were going to be
in there and I gave my dad one and he ate
[SPEAKER_03]: it and got so high that he like passed out
on the couch and then crawled to the
[SPEAKER_03]: bathroom because he had to throw up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just so intense of a, of a high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ever since then, I've been like
extremely careful with my portioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think that was when I was like,
you know, 17 or 18 and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, you can take it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, just eat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've death sentenced my friends by
accident before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's funny though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so with, uh, with some of your earlier
grows, when you were just doing the home
[SPEAKER_03]: grow thing, what were some of the methods
that you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: What sort of style of growing were you
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like to dabble a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main style would be cocoa coir and,
um, sort of any, any of those pre-made
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've used advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's what I started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was emerald harvest, um,
just like all the fancy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, I started buying just like
general hydroponic because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn like, um, at the time I was a big
fan and still am, I don't follow much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, Dr. Coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned like by watching his
tutorials, like even if you go back into
[SPEAKER_01]: some of my old tutorials, they're like,
I love Dr. Coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how embarrassing, like shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I ended up on a podcast with,
with all those guys, which is like
[SPEAKER_01]: something cool that, you know,
um, I used to be on growing with my fellow
[SPEAKER_01]: growers lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with the guys at the beginning for a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with the Shane and the guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I think I first
encountered you was with the growing with
[SPEAKER_03]: my fellow growers podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that was one of the, those are my
old G's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it was one of those
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, um, I feel like I, my podcast also
kind of falls within the same category of
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to be educational where we're
trying to like not only allow people to
[SPEAKER_03]: tell stories, but to get information out
there that they feel would benefit the
[SPEAKER_03]: community of both growers and consumers
alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they were definitely some of the
earlier shows that you could listen to and
[SPEAKER_03]: really pick up a lot of great information
that you could then apply to your own,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, either home growing situation or if
you were taking notes of all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different things that you were learning
and you could cross reference it based on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this panel of people that were
providing their insight into like specific
[SPEAKER_03]: topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think one of the first ones I
ever listened to was their indoor versus
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor, um, grow talk, which to me was
just such great information to help,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, teach any new grower about like light
cycles and, um, substrate needs and
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements and electrical needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, if you are trying to remain,
um, on the cheap home grow side of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: then how you can accomplish that without
needing to invest all this money into
[SPEAKER_03]: tents and lights and nutrients and all the
expensive gizmos and gadgets, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was, it was refreshing to hear
that because so many other places were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you have to buy a air conditioner
and you need to seal your room and get
[SPEAKER_03]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, with that tape and shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To this day, like giant zip ties to hold
up my fans in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things are ghettoed up to make it as
cheap as possible, but I learned so much
[SPEAKER_01]: from those guys and they continue to learn
from those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they are some of the top OGs like
still fucking committed and every single
[SPEAKER_01]: week, you know, like, holy, no matter
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In their lives, like especially shout out
to like Jack and, um, Russ and like the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are there, like every single
week, like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've both done an episode with me and,
uh, I've also sung their praise because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've taught a lot of people how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could do that for a living and
make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what, that's the dream,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what I came out hopping to do
was like, I have posts on LinkedIn that
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, fuck government weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's home grew together and I'll
teach you how, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody wants to pay me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I got to go back into,
into the old money bags, but it's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: dream would be, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The passion is aligned with the home
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the heart of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will always say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's such a battle for me ethically to
work at scale and export and live behind
[SPEAKER_01]: these regulations and stand behind these
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And know that that's not the heart of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the companies aren't smoking the
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go, you get that guy in a room and you
smoke them under the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll never let you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're drinking alcohol and snorting
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar all over.
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm lucky to be in a, in a position with
the companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Company that I'm at where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I'm proud to, uh,
consume the cannabis that we produce
[SPEAKER_03]: because it is, it's small.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little four room facility,
12 lights per room, a couple of large veg
[SPEAKER_03]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we also do two acres of outdoor
where we take a lot of good care on our
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor plants and, um, use non-toxic and,
um, you know, regulated, uh, regulation
[SPEAKER_03]: approved sprays for pests and pathogen
prevention.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we turn it all into fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all gets processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's some of the, like the better and
stuff on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, you're leading me into the
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have interviewed for a couple of places
that basically grow biomass in a good way
[SPEAKER_01]: for inputs or, um, to make, um,
yeah, inputs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we use a lot of general agricultural
practices, um, cause we do row cropping
[SPEAKER_03]: basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's very satisfying to be able
to accomplish so much with such a small
[SPEAKER_03]: team because sometimes I feel like the
outdoor places, they think, Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to just get a bunch of labor to
throw at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm going to dry it all and trim it
all up and sell this flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, that's just not necessarily the
move for outdoor cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I feel like concentrates and,
uh, extracts are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a green house.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a green bout going on in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really good climates to grow
even here in New Brunswick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if I had the money to get
something started on this land,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's 60 acres here I could grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it's tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so with your, um, it, so it sounds
like you've mostly done salt based,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, simply organic or like solely organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the last like three and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indoor and outdoor always outdoor has
been organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've always been interested in
learning about soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hang around with the guys that
have taught me how to build my own soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I've always been interested in
it, but I never understood it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as a salt grower, I was always trying
to control everything and add everything
[SPEAKER_01]: up by math.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'd be like, you know,
like I just didn't understand how the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant was just picking up the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it wanted, you know, like,
or when it needed, you just had to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, the plant happy in the root
zone and how simple it is to do organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just really started diving into
that more indoor, um, as I was able to at
[SPEAKER_01]: the facility that I was at, plus doing it
at home on a smaller scale in my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeing the variation to some of the
same genetics even, um, between salt
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor facility grown with like some of
the best equipment and then also just in
[SPEAKER_01]: my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see like different variations,
but so organic is new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's where I align now as far as the
best quality cannabis is organic living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil grown cannabis, in my opinion,
based on doing my own experimenting with
[SPEAKER_01]: the same genetics in organics,
in salts, using different fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: even organic synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the best quality in my opinion is
always going to be the living.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and even more so like the Huey culture
stuff that I grow outside, as long as it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a genetic that's for outside because it's
been bred outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something from California or even the
East coast over here, that is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a lot of people, um,
sort of say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but I, you know, I, I always like to
ask though, when was the last time that
[SPEAKER_03]: you took, uh, you know, the same care for
a small number of plants and grew them
[SPEAKER_03]: with salts at home?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it sounds like you've been doing
organics for three years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to just say, well,
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I switched back to salts, uh,
at the end of this outdoor season,
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided I was unpracticed and so I
wanted to get back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's harder to find the inputs that I
need just living really where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, that's kind of been that
I'll just do, you know, make my own shit
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can get it here, but so,
um, I, I've always used Canna Coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just stuck with my Canna Coco and
then, um, I'm using like a local
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer company called rise nutrients
and it's working really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, just like what I'm trying to say
is that these part A and part B nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, like I I'm using rise nutrients
right now and it's working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, previous to that, I was using Remo
nutrients and they work really well with
[SPEAKER_01]: the same Canna Coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily see different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find them to be all very similar and I
like ease of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to always usually be my
go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like rise because it's local and I can
get it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remo, I can also get here, but you know,
there's a chance a kid, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shipment could not make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could drive to the rise guys house,
probably be like, hook me up, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to choose local.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um, I've been a huge fan of,
uh, JR crop tech for salt based nutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't believe that they're available
in Canada yet, or they might have just
[SPEAKER_03]: recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it, they have like one bag for
flour, one bag for veg and you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, either use the salts,
um, directly into your reservoir and mix
[SPEAKER_03]: them up, or you can make a stock solution
and dose them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they, they don't sell their own
calcium nitrate, which is really nice
[SPEAKER_03]: because brand name calcium nitrate,
when it's under a hydroponic nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: label is always more expensive,
but you can get really high grade calcium
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrate for extremely cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, they like promote that you do
that, which is really nice because it
[SPEAKER_03]: really reduces the overall cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Per gallon mixed, even at high strengths,
like, um, at the facility that I,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, help manage right now, we're running
between 4.0 and 4.5 EC input, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's, it's really high and a lot
of people get like, Whoa, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, yeah, but we have
really high PFD, CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked at a place that also ran
really high like that, or like where it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't read it's like five plus or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I mean, we, we try to keep it
within there and then by using substrate
[SPEAKER_03]: monitoring, we can detect that,
you know, that the poor water EC is
[SPEAKER_03]: staying right around there, which is
really ideal for like a bulking phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can raise it up really
quickly for, um, a finite, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, a ripening phase or a stretching
phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get those generative and
vegetative cues and, uh, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: turn on a dime a lot quicker with that
high EC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's easier to reduce and,
uh, increase based on your substrate
[SPEAKER_03]: management.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've seen people also crash and burn
really quickly when they don't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: correct monitoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, like the different like substrate
meters and whatnot to be able to tell when
[SPEAKER_03]: their plants are getting out of a safe
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what worries me right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big facilities is just like,
they don't prepare as well for the dry
[SPEAKER_01]: out, I guess, like, especially in
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're using high EC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always suggest Coco because Rockwell,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get too dry, then you're never
going to really recover from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some things in some big
facilities, uh, out, out west or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in a 500,000 foot facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just pods, pump pods, pump pods,
just weed fields of weed inside and
[SPEAKER_01]: walking into a room where the staff the
day before forgot to like switch the
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation to on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a transplant or whatever,
and like the whole one side of the crop is
[SPEAKER_01]: just like laying on the ground basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also seen it where they quickly
like burst the juice in and come back in
[SPEAKER_01]: two hours and they're like, they're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're like, you know, it's like
amazing how resilient these plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: when you think of plants dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of watching some of those,
like what not to do has been like,
[SPEAKER_01]: very beneficial and helpful for me to like
be like, okay, so that's the extreme of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you learn a lot from the
different failures that you witness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, sometimes the successes go under
the radar because things are just working
[SPEAKER_03]: as they should.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't necessarily catch that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one thing you did really helped set
it off right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, uh, throughout your growing
experience, both, um, indoors at,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with your home grow outdoors
with your home grow at the different
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities that you've helped,
uh, run manage and work at what were some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the successes that you found in your
growing experiences there that helped you
[SPEAKER_03]: learn something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the flip side of that coin,
what are some of the failures that you
[SPEAKER_03]: witnessed that helped you learn something
kind of within the same vein of thought
[SPEAKER_03]: that we were just talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, probably one of the most like,
kept me up at night, but was the most
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting and best learning experience was
at the last facility I was at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came there to basically develop the,
the, um, cultivation department.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so first thing we started with was a
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I came out here,
part of it was that, that genetic library
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of the genetics, and I'm just
choosing not to say the names of places
[SPEAKER_01]: that I work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the genetics people can figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetics that were at their 20,000
seeds, 500 different strains, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and literal cuts too, that were shipped
over here, like somehow, some way all from
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Jodry, California, like huge genetic
seed banks, like just stuff that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, holy fuck, like this guy doesn't
even know what he has, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he probably does cause he got most of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went on a big thing anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's, that was like 300,
over 300 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a small phenohunt when you talk
about like what people do out at scale or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but like, you know, 30 seeds
each, 14 different strains, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: all researched by me and my team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picked out a 500, which is really hard
when you have like, it's an overwhelming
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of like research and okay guys,
like we're just at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's on this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to figure out what your CEO
wants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like not what I want, but what he
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gives me this, like, I want fruits,
give me all the fruits, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that's the first hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting apples, we're getting
bananas, we're getting grapes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you want, there's all these different
strains of all those different fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, you know, trying to narrow it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just from the very day one,
I was never, that was my first big task
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was responsible for that much
genetic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it kept me up at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what if these seeds don't pop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've always been really good at it,
you know, but I've never been able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this because facilities out here aren't
popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're just going in, you're working,
you're doing your nine to five and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so it was like unbelievably that he
was trusting me with this, but we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a 98% success rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was exhilarating, exhilarating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause these seeds were all different ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't know, some of them we didn't
even have history on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just like heaven days bank,
you know, like cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that, that whole process from
eliminating like, so we, we like it was
[SPEAKER_01]: over 300 seeds that survived all these
little seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have pictures of school's thing to
go in every day and be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, getting them past that
first transplant and then you start
[SPEAKER_01]: sending them in for DNA, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That all, that whole process is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was very successful that whole
year, just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ended up getting really like 20 solid
genetics to add to his library and only
[SPEAKER_01]: they've used one really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the top one just for what was
trending at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the grape because it,
we picked that, I picked that because all
[SPEAKER_01]: through the grow, it was the only one that
smelled like real grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew it wasn't terpenes and I knew it
was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it dried, it smelled like
grape candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you smoked it, you got so
high, it was high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a really, it was easy to
grow low leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just obviously a good choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was probably my biggest
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that one awards, um, there was
the very first legal cannabis cup at one
[SPEAKER_01]: third.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that's a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to win first every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also in New Brunswick,
um, it was runner up for top sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think last year or the year before,
they do a cannabis cup out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that genetic, um, first, like a first
time gal just, you know, no 30 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic hunting or growing here,
but you know, having obviously Kevin at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time to help out here and there,
he's a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever I really truly needed it,
um, but that was probably the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you get into the biggest failure,
um, I, I love the conversation of feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, hunting because I feel like it's
one of those things that are, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like one of the last real sort of
like passionate, um, things that people
[SPEAKER_03]: can get into with cannabis is like
breeding and phenol hunting because you
[SPEAKER_03]: can have such unique tastes that are very
subjective to yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're kind of following that,
you know, call it passion or call it
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want of I like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to follow it to try and find
the best iteration.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so many times you can find something
that is just exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but a lot of people will do phenol
hunting in different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was curious, what were some of
the practices during your phenol hunt that
[SPEAKER_03]: you took that, um, other people might be
able to learn from?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about phenol hunting and I
don't pretend to be a master or an expert
[SPEAKER_01]: at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, most of my experience literally comes
from my own home, growing outdoor indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then that, that experience as
well, and just all the different genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've grown in the last six years to
scale, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something to that, but
basically the, the thing that is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: simple that made me understand it the
most, especially when you're doing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to be good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, I'm going to use my
intuition and what I like as a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: a daily smoker, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in this, like, I am a consumer too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I am like a, I'm an elite
different, like small make note,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't buy weed from, I'm not the
consumer that they're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to like, um, figure out what
your project is first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this advice comes from Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who is like a world renowned breeder,
breeder, teacher, phenol hunter,
[SPEAKER_01]: mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that simple as like you phenol
hunt based on whatever your goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you make a goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether that's your goal, so that's
going to be for, I'm gonna be phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting for a medical strain for effect,
or I'm going to be phenol hunting because
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to look visually great,
or I'm going to be phenol hunting because
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm phenol hunting because I want all
those things, you know, and I want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: smell like a fruit, my boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, so it almost became easier
at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out my own rating charts just
based on the, um, the directive that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting from different mentors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like all my mentors, I was like asking
and pulling information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the guys I was just speaking of,
um, they let me stay in the group chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though I'm not on there every week
with them, I can still read and learn what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're popping in there, or I've gone in
there with questions, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based on all that knowledge and just
like my own research, I created a rating
[SPEAKER_01]: sheets, which I find is really helpful to,
to write things down as home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do it enough, I think,
or people just maybe don't think of it as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as important as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I always started with like
journaling and writing it all down because
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working on a forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was posting this stuff and then
eventually it turned into notebooks that
[SPEAKER_01]: were just like records of what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically keeping records, however,
that looks for me, it was a checklist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who doesn't love a check,
like a check board where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: checklisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I'm looking authoritative to the
plants, like, hello, yeah, I'm the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got the, I got the clipboard today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like based on what you're looking
for, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So visually you're looking through them
all the way from seedling development to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to flower, which is the most important,
obviously, but you're looking for vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in bed, you're looking for vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing that you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, you can see that by how fast
the plant's growing, how, how dry it's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: More quickly, how much more you have to up
pot it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's bigger when a plant's just
like, let's get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to grow into a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good plant right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you don't know if you have a male
or female maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it depends on what your project is
again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you are looking for a male cause
people are pheno hunting males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Royal Kush pollen because I did a
male pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, probably the biggest thing for
people that they can take home and use is
[SPEAKER_01]: record keeping and then following that
along and not doing too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to keep your plants as healthy
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't want to be survivor hunting,
not in the first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want, you want to be looking for,
for fabulous and you can't look for
[SPEAKER_01]: fabulous when they're on death's door.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're like, Oh yeah, I'm going to
starve these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, not on the first run,
not on the first run.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I always tell people they
need to create a baseline that they need
[SPEAKER_03]: to follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: In all of their practices when pheno
hunting and they can't baby any of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't treat any of them special.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to just perform on their own and
you have to choose them from that
[SPEAKER_03]: performance and document it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, one thing that I
always like to ask, because I have my own
[SPEAKER_03]: very specific practices for this,
but what do you like to flower out in a
[SPEAKER_03]: pheno hunt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like to flower out the seed plant,
like the plant that was produced from the
[SPEAKER_03]: seedling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you like to clone it and flower out
the clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, for me, it would depend on what
I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting something that is going
to perform well in a facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can clone and see how it's going
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then just keep repeating it
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd say if you're looking for a
unicorn and you're, you're able to really
[SPEAKER_01]: follow that seed right through to flower,
that's your mother, like your first
[SPEAKER_01]: mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you, um, when you do that,
when you flower out a seed plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: are you usually taking cuttings and saving
the cuttings as your mothers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first mother that you're
flowering out, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then her babies are waiting in lieu to
either be called or move on to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: um, flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting to see, I guess it's
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying is it's valuable to see
that seed product turn into a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in my experience, that seed plant is a
stronger, that's the most vigorous the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just like the stocks are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just like, it's an amazing thing
to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if anyone can do it,
um, most facilities can't because they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have, you know, four or five rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then one of them is probably for moms and
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're on a tight schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times you're not even
going to, you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: see any of those seed mom, seed,
seed plants become the flower goddesses
[SPEAKER_01]: that they deserve to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um, it's, it's for that exact reason
that I always suggest people, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: flower out clones because sometimes when
you have a seed plant, right, and you grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it out and it's super healthy,
super vigorous and you, you flower it out
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get this awesome expression and
structure and you saved a clone of it and
[SPEAKER_03]: then you go back and you flower that clone
out, you might be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the, the vigor changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the flower morphology especially
will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've noticed sometimes that the
terpene profile will change from a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: plant to a mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could just be due to, you know,
whether it be the taproot or, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the overall root structure and the
vigor of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, I see the value in it, especially
for home growers, because it might be the
[SPEAKER_03]: best iteration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they just are going to be popping
seeds every run, then why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: But definitely in like a commercial
setting, it almost makes more sense to
[SPEAKER_03]: flower out the clone because that's what
your act, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what your successive or
yeah, successive crops are going to be,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, how they are going to be best
represented is, is from the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if your goal is a factory setting and,
and sometimes even a small place is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, everything is a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still sort of mini factory setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else to call it,
but you got to make sure that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to perform like their sisters,
like it's all going to be very,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, homogenized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like for, for people that
are growing for medicine too, it's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the reasons why I never suggest auto
flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people that are growing specifically
for medicine, because if they find an auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flower that produces this awesome
cannabinoid and terpene profile and they
[SPEAKER_03]: say, Oh, this is the best medicine I've
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some tough news, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be extremely hard to find
that again, because you can't clone the
[SPEAKER_03]: auto flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, unless you're working with a
really refined company like Mephisto
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics or something, you're not going to
be able to necessarily find the same
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype within that same pack of seeds
or even in 10 different packs of the same
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's where I always am telling
people, you know, like run your clone,
[SPEAKER_03]: because if that's the unicorn for you,
then you know that you have it and that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a faster way to get to that goal too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what I'm hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they do it like that in,
in regulated cannabis or in facilities is
[SPEAKER_01]: because exactly you want to make sure that
it's going to perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're using your, your,
like I have the same weed, I have some new
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but I have the same stuff that I
know works for me for the last few years
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep doing its thing for,
you know, and the point of getting ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: is the uniformity is what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the consistent medicine, exactly what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even as a home guard, if you're
medically minded, you might want,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is my strain for daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my strain for nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the two I like to mix
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the one I make for oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there's, there's so many
different avenues that we could go into in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of maintaining that genetic stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where people need to keep the mothers
healthy, keep them happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to, you know, if, if they are
keeping moms around for a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: they need to know the risks that they're
possibly going to have to face through
[SPEAKER_03]: that through, you know, different
pressures building up within the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it be viral or a fungal or
pathogenic pests, you know, all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different things that keeping a plan
around for a long time, which was a very
[SPEAKER_03]: common practice in the traditional market
days of I need to keep this mom around
[SPEAKER_03]: because she's the one that produces the
clones that I like to run versus
[SPEAKER_03]: successful successively cloning them at a
regular interval to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have fresh, vigorous genetic material to
make your production clones from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this is super relevant,
relevant for home growers who are growing
[SPEAKER_03]: for medicine, as well as then,
you know, anybody that's wanting to take
[SPEAKER_03]: those practices, like you took your
practices, like I took my practices and
[SPEAKER_03]: translate that into a commercial space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning some of these things is extremely
crucial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen some definite like,
uh, missteps where people will try to
[SPEAKER_03]: enter into the commercial space and take
their, you know, I baby this one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and make them my everything for
this three or four months that I'm growing
[SPEAKER_03]: them and then go into a facility and get
really disappointed by the fact that they
[SPEAKER_03]: can't baby every single plant because
they're responsible for hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a real shock as a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a huge shock for me as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, uh, even the first, yeah,
even the first facility I worked at,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything was hand watered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, and I was like, oh, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to spend time with each plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I looked back and I'm like,
how, how did we even afford that sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: labor for the amount of product we are
producing?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irrigation has been the one thing that's
trended in all my positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was an irrigation lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this one spot who I was hired on
to help get the automation going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a vertical grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we were hand watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am trying to remember how many plants
are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three tiers, dude, three tiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we were using a, um, the zoom boom
to water the plants with buckets and
[SPEAKER_01]: ladders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one time where I was in the
mother room and I swear to God,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had this footage, but I was on
this rickety old ladder with my five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon bucket, dragging it up to the
second level.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even have a hose and a pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because of the weird concoctions of
things that were going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even get into that, but up on a
big ladder with my lab beaker,
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic beaker, like watering these three
gallon three hundred and seventy five
[SPEAKER_03]: milliliters in each one, five times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No human error.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you kind of go log it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, that's not even my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell off the ladder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything went down and I was like
hanging from the second tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hand watered like 900 plant rooms,
like three tier, 900 plant rooms like that
[SPEAKER_01]: for six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder, how did I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just made me think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must have blocked it out, but it's like
a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think of actually like setting up
the automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were using Netaflex and it was my first
time it was during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they got the Netaflex machine into
the facility, but because of COVID they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't send a, uh, it was cause it's
from Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was nobody coming over from
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they couldn't bring out any texts to
like train the staff on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that had all sort of happened before I
got hired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got hired and they're like,
here's this kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll teach you stuff and then set this
up, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was lots of experiences where you
send the water out and it goes up and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, oh my God, I hope that went
into the right room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're running down the hallway
to the facility and people are yelling
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's like, oh my God, the store
just in their storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like so many crazy irrigation
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's crazy floods, floods,
floods, like 500, like how these were 2000
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons tanks for RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, how does it, how is it not
automated to shut off when it hits the
[SPEAKER_01]: top?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you'd like to go back and
be like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole place to be like so flooded.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always did that with acid once,
like for, um, um, phosphorus acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: it like exploded out of the Netflix
machine and the whole place was flooded
[SPEAKER_01]: with acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like eight months later, still cleaning up
like pieces from the ground that were like
[SPEAKER_03]: chewed away.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the net of flex is the, um,
like the fritigation skid, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it has a few different input
channels that you can put the different
[SPEAKER_03]: like acid or the, your different MPKs and
whatnot into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then send it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we use one of those for our field
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the craziest part to me is that
the software that the thing runs off of is
[SPEAKER_03]: from like the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say it looks like an
old computer when you're on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the, yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to like, the, the screen is
like that green with like black block
[SPEAKER_03]: letters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably have pictures on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can find some, I'll send them to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use the same machine every summer and it
works great when it's correctly
[SPEAKER_03]: functioning, but it took us a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my boss had, you know, a manual this
thick that he read through to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that he understood it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then only taught me the things that I
needed to know and like distilled it down
[SPEAKER_03]: to, okay, these are the only functions you
ever have to mess with because there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get the little piece in there
that you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember it for the summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like right now, cause we're going
to get ramping back up to get our crop
[SPEAKER_03]: going for the summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, Oh, I don't, I would have to
go and stand in front of the machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, for an hour to just remind myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The memories came right back to me for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wondered why does this machine
seem so old, but it's like new technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, it is really strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because it's been used for so
long in, in greenhouse, uh, irrigation and
[SPEAKER_03]: applications, um, where you, you know,
and the thing with it is, is you need
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity to run it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I always suggest people,
if they are setting up like a commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: facility or even like a an advanced home
grow where they have, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few lights in a, in a room built out
that they could just go with something
[SPEAKER_03]: simple, like a dosatron where it's all
hydraulic and it all just doses your
[SPEAKER_03]: system through the water pressure itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just, if you have clean water
on your main, then you can run it from
[SPEAKER_03]: your main and you don't, you won't ever
lose water pressure unless the entire like
[SPEAKER_03]: district you live in loses water pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that happens, you have a whole
bunch more stuff to worry about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some crazy learning curves
out here for weather shit, like hurricanes
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing shit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or freezes as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure because you probably have to keep
your lines, like your, your fill lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything's running outdoors,
you got to keep them wrapped in some sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of heating cord or have a, we,
we, we've had some like crazy ice storms
[SPEAKER_03]: out here in Oregon where we had to set up
like a, a drip setting in our different
[SPEAKER_03]: irrigation systems where we would have it
burst little amounts of water through the
[SPEAKER_03]: system every couple minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very small amounts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just stuff like that, that you start
to learn the, you know, how the facility
[SPEAKER_03]: operates based on all these other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you start to become that like
universal key where you're, I can fix that
[SPEAKER_03]: really quick or I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it does come with time and with a
lot of, uh, failures, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you don't know that your lines are
going to freeze until one of them explodes
[SPEAKER_03]: on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, we kind of got a little
bit off track there, but I think it was
[SPEAKER_03]: great, you know, with the Fino hunting and
irrigation stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of stuff that people should
know is, you know, it takes a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out and to experience based for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not learning by the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that manual did nothing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was scary because I didn't have someone
visually showing me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a different, um, with,
with that being, you know, we were at,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, where your successes were,
and then we were going to go into what one
[SPEAKER_03]: of, uh, your setbacks were that you
learned a lot from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead and share that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably my bae, my first big setback
or, um, where I was disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was also in the first year of the place
when I came out here, um, it was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: spot where I was like fully in charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any crop failures would be me,
um, facing the consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had some challenging in input
issues and S and like I had alluded to
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, um, it was a big shock to come
from Western Canada to Eastern Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: East coast specifically where,
um, the biggest city for me is an hour and
[SPEAKER_01]: a half away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not even that big of a city
compared to what I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and just not being able to get the
things that I need, especially at a scale
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, was working with different soil
companies because it was a living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was aquaponics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to find a living soil that's
also going to be complimented by our fish
[SPEAKER_01]: poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or second, I can't remember if it was the
first or second, um, flower grow where it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, um, monocrop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dosy cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the soil, the soil that we were
using ended up being, um, like the batch
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had made was extra hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants were just getting fried.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were getting ammonia burned and like,
so it was like hard to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it Brown town cause it was like a
section of the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just turning Brown and we had to,
to get rid of some of those plants early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't all die, but, um, it wasn't,
it wasn't a good crop and compared to when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm used to growing or what we had grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just got to take your dumps with
your successes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not all going to be roses and
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it is going to be
disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, at that point we were just
trying to do our best to like get the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the other thing, because from
that crop, we didn't use most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, most of it went to garbage,
but that the other big fail that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: think of was, um, managing the grow where
I have full control because I'm there
[SPEAKER_01]: every single day versus managing the same
strain at a different facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two provinces away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not listening to me or
updating me or keeping in touch or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, it's just like hard to
work with this man who just won't work
[SPEAKER_01]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so we had just gotten into BC
here, which is hard to get into for all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way from the East coast, this little,
but I had sent the buyers, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dose of cake and I had sent them like
the weed and they were just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the batch went over there,
it was, uh, mixed with a crop that was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it was our crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the quality was different and like,
maybe not to, to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my boss would look at it and go,
it's exactly the same, but to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: like me or you would be like, no,
like I don't want to sell this mid,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll sell this good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people can see the difference,
smell it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what went out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to literally face to face that buyer
because he's like, I went out and bought a
[SPEAKER_01]: dose of cake and he's like, it was not
what you sent me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was hard to talk to, you know,
like to just like be the grower and be
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible, but not throw people under
the bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's not that, cause I did,
I let it go out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was in my control or I thought it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so it's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that makes the job harder,
but like I said, you take your dumps with
[SPEAKER_01]: your success and it's not as often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find that the job is more rewarding
than it is not rewarding.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really great point that you bring
up that just because two people are
[SPEAKER_03]: growing the same strain with the same SOPs
and, you know, attempting to mimic the
[SPEAKER_03]: styles as exact as possible, the end
product can turn out vastly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe it's an environmental
factor that's slightly different,
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe there's an input factor that's
slightly different, you know, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's, that was what I noticed was the
biggest thing was the different irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lazy version versus consistent
irrigation, like just tip, just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people just, it's a labor of
love, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hand watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: The irrigation practices as well,
especially if you are in a living soil
[SPEAKER_03]: situation, then the nutrient availability
is going to be highly dependent upon how
[SPEAKER_03]: that irrigation is applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, not only is it just
irrigation, at that point it's the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient density within the root zone and
the, you know, percentage of different
[SPEAKER_03]: constituents that are making up that
nutrient package for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all going to be adjusted because
irrigation can affect, especially in
[SPEAKER_03]: living soil, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It can affect the pH of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to let it ride it out in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not like, that's what I missed
about salts, you know, just being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: flush it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush and control versus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can flush it and reset it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like watching Browntown just slowly die
before my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's gotta be really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was coming from like strictly going
automated salt places, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell, Coco to like, this is living
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and then also this was with like a
dual root zone aquaponic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were hand watering in the fish poo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah, we were doing a bunch of
actually research studies with the
[SPEAKER_01]: government of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were maximizing on funding through
certain tax benefits that you get for
[SPEAKER_01]: doing R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead of it costing a lot of
money, we ended up, you know, it paid for
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was through doing effluent
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working with a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were using actually the dosey cake to
replicate, you know, is this making a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference basically by adding this
effluent?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in this poop?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, we had sent it away for
microbial analysis, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to get because you can go to
your basic cannabis lab or any lab really
[SPEAKER_01]: and get a microbial analysis that'll tell
you like your CFU or exactly how much
[SPEAKER_01]: microbials are on something, but it can't
tell you what microbes those are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are they good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was through a university in Halifax,
I think Dalhousie, it's a good popular
[SPEAKER_01]: one, that we got our affluent and our soil
and like the scientists led that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: research project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were actually on a couple of
the world aquaponic, the virtual
[SPEAKER_01]: conference too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the scientists on there talking about
what they found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is that there wasn't
really any rare or like unique microbe in
[SPEAKER_01]: fish effluent that was doing anything to
create like higher yield, higher quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, any microbial input will help
break down what you need and will work the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, whether it's fish poop, worm poop,
teas that people brew based on those
[SPEAKER_01]: things, compost, that kind of thing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always listen to, or I used to listen to
a lot the growing with fishes podcast with
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Reisner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always wanted to try out like the
dual root zone planting where you have
[SPEAKER_03]: your little fish tank and you just run
almost like a thin nutrient film tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have the plant planting
technique with the plants sitting above it
[SPEAKER_03]: with the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can visualize that diagram right now,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted the Tilapia home when they got
rid of the fish farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, can I have like, they're three
pound fish, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my fish guy, Gary was like,
I'll tell you a sad story, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you don't want one of those in
your living room because you need a big
[SPEAKER_01]: pool and you'll find it on the ground dead
one day, which I did always find lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: dead fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just hop out of the tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they lose oxygen, those suckers
are jumping out there and it's aggressive
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, you have to have netting on our
genetics anyways, the Tilapia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, they like a warmer,
a warmer, a warmer water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, um, I feel like anybody that
hasn't really heard much about,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, uh, aquaponics should go and listen to
the growing with fishes podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they are the experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had very basic knowledge of it,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want me on there that I've asked to
be like a speaker and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I declined because like, it's not my
forte.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I did that, but it was very
ghetto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not, you know, but it was a good
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fish actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a picture of them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a couple more questions to go
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'll ask them and then,
um, we'll just go from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, with all of the,
um, experience that you have had,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, especially it sounds like you've seen
some of the practices within the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: that a lot of people might be like,
Ooh, that's something that I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as well as some of the things that
you've seen that are fairly successful
[SPEAKER_03]: within the industry and, and, you know,
running teams that are highly productive
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and really helping hone in those
different aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what are some of the things that you
would like to see change within the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, honestly, uh, the most important thing
I think that needs to change is just what
[SPEAKER_01]: we were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in regards to, uh, positive
leadership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there just needs to be a bigger
shift in management and leadership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that needs to trickle down into
productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I feel like any, any facility
or any industry or any workplace is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to need to incorporate that, um,
type of, you know, newer style leadership,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to get anywhere and to get people to
stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want, we're seeing more transition and
less, um, like staff retention because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just not being treated properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the generation of today is like,
fuck you, you know, like they didn't do
[SPEAKER_01]: not give one shit about paying for rent or
like they'll go live in an RV by the
[SPEAKER_01]: river.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people just won't put up with shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that managers need to follow that
trend, you know, because it's just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's such a waste of, um, a per a
company's money and time to be replacing
[SPEAKER_01]: these people constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you need to get the right
people in and do the right things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to pay them properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Communicate more, more transparency,
honestly, like, but I don't really see
[SPEAKER_01]: those things changing quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just going to be like,
that's how I see, um, changes happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't necessarily mean that
that's where anything's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so slowly, but surely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, in the same line of thought,
uh, what are some of the pitfalls that you
[SPEAKER_03]: might be seeing in the industry or perhaps
things that are being swept under the rug?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, are there any other, other things
there that you're seeing other than what
[SPEAKER_03]: you've talked about pitfalls?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess for me would be like regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, the tight regulations and the
amount of tax that, um, that is being
[SPEAKER_01]: taken from cannabis is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I know at the basic level
from being in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in Canada, you're having to feed
all the different provinces separately
[SPEAKER_01]: like separate, um, buyers, they all have
different rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can't mess up at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're, they're taking all your
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things are, are starting to get known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're seeing like leaders in this
industry shouting out about it and wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: excise reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's going to stop a lot
of these smaller businesses from being
[SPEAKER_01]: taken out honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so the pitfall is the changes
are, are coming too slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so companies are just expiring because
they can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't wait for the changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the people are getting taken out and
it's just not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like going to be a monopoly,
just like every other industry where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all these corporations that own
everything and everything's being exported
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't want to pay the excise
tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you like good weed and you,
you want it from this guy, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't get it from this guy because he
needs to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's exporting it to Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any good weed, you're making more
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know this for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making $2 a gram for dank ass weed
in Canada domestically versus four plus
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars internationally at their like
American or Australian or you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: euros, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's even more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no excise makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like supporting the local consumers
and community over your, um, trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the highest dollar is something that a lot
of people should think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's, that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so having been a new grower,
uh, and trying to, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: successfully entering into the commercial
space, um, what are some, what is some
[SPEAKER_03]: advice that you would give to new growers,
whether it be, um, in a home grow sense or
[SPEAKER_01]: in a commercial sense, new growers,
so much, so much, um, the best advice I
[SPEAKER_01]: can give to new growers is to start with
good reputable genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, invest in yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So figure out research, um, find out,
come to me, even come to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure ask where people are buying,
um, their genetics and how, cause
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't mind having those
conversations, but I think that's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can get so turned away by having
just someone's son, someone's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, basement unstable genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would, I would give a new grower
those and let them know that's what they
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, this is a good
learning curve too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's watch for everything,
you know, like, so there's benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wouldn't, if you're just doing this
on your own and you're like, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make your own medicine and you want to
learn and get on as quickly as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to start with good quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's genetics first.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, genetics always
tend to be at the forefront of what's
[SPEAKER_03]: important for a new grower to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one thing that I do like to add to
that is that I think it's beneficial for a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of new growers if they have it
available to grow a clone rather than a
[SPEAKER_03]: seed, because clones that are tested and
proven, you can have certain expectations
[SPEAKER_03]: on exactly what it should look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas with seeds sometimes, even if
they're really refined and from a really
[SPEAKER_03]: reputable breeder, there can be different
morphologies that the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that the phenotype can take that might
throw you off from thinking that it is
[SPEAKER_03]: what you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you grow a clone and you see it
grow out and you do it a few times and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can kind of see this is what something
that is supposed to produce really well
[SPEAKER_03]: does in my setting and environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can then start to look through
seeds and find things that are you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: comparable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go, this is where my baseline
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how it grows here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start looking through seeds
because I do want to try something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a grape flavor or maybe find
something that's an OG or a GMO or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just something that you,
maybe if it's flavor forward that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: searching for or a specific cannabinoid
profile that you're searching for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can at least still know what you can
do with the, um, the setup that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, this has been a wonderful
conversation, Genevieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate you joining me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I do like to wrap up the show with a
couple of questions that I ask all of my
[SPEAKER_03]: fellow growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what is your favorite strain of all
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love White Widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not growing White Widow though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a good one though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I just need to invest in my
favorite White Widow that I've ever grown
[SPEAKER_01]: is from Amsterdam, Amsterdam marijuana
seeds, um, out in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually my favorite genetic seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do their own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they have the best White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like their White Widow Extreme it's
called.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that one I, I grew so long ago that I
was pre before I was like getting a lab to
[SPEAKER_01]: test anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the terpenes are on
it, but I can guess that limonene is up
[SPEAKER_01]: there because of the euphoria that you
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I haven't felt a lot of strains
that give me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely need to invest in getting
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had White Widow in probably a
decade or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love a good skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, every time I hear skunk,
I, I, I just can't ever, I can't remember
[SPEAKER_03]: ever having something that did taste like
skunk because the closest thing that I
[SPEAKER_03]: could, yeah, the closest thing I can think
of is like a good GMO or, um, like one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the different burger strains from,
from Skunk Master Flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried one of those,
but GMO for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, those, those are always
like, I think that that's what skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: tastes like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to get out there and buy
some White Widow Extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a really unique, like I'd say
like a burnt rubber, I still remember
[SPEAKER_01]: like, but almost like lemon, burnt rubber,
hazy smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does sound good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, along the same, uh, line of
questioning, what is your favorite breeder
[SPEAKER_03]: of all time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who is your favorite breeder of all
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard, hard, hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd probably be what I've grown the most
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to think like collectively,
like what, where do I go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've grown a lot of Barney's Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown a lot of Dynafem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Jodry is also a favorite breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some of his, um, genetics,
not just from, you know, where I worked,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also seeds he's given.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm trying to think of a Canadian
person that I want to pull up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like sometimes it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black cherry punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only because they didn't come to
my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, geez Louise, I've already grown just
like in commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a breeder out here, Mother Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've grown Black Cherry Punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got from in-house genetics,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the whole story of it,
but I've grown it in different facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: because these facilities have bought it
from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're located in Saskatchewan,
which is where I grew up and was born,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could ever get a job working under
Brian, who is the CEO and founder or like
[SPEAKER_01]: on their science team as like someone's
assistant, I would love that job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just how much learning, the tissue
culture, like banking, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: like breeding, phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, imagine going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you do every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's probably paperwork
involved, but yeah, definitely a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, so I'm going to say they're my
favorite because I have experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have tissue culture come up a lot
on the podcast because, um, so many people
[SPEAKER_03]: are getting into it and I think it's
really important experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, there's like a lot of calm that
you have to maintain in order to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, tissue culture very well, because so
much of it is very fine motor skills and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your facility needs me, Nick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we, we are so small, but, uh,
international here I come.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I not, not currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, so last question then on sort of
these, these, uh, wrap up questions is
[SPEAKER_03]: what is your most memorable cannabis or
smoking related experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some people, it'll be their
first time smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really that first like joint that
I, my buddy forced down my throat when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, I'm going to kill myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, that's pretty out there,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that joint saved my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in like a really hopeful, but like
desperate that, you know, that's it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a fun way, I was trying to think of
a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I guess it would be that trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking, I called it, um, like the grand
weed tour 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was literally driving down the
coast through Washington, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California, stopped in weed,
California to look for weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, sorry, we don't have any
weed and it's dangerous for you to be
[SPEAKER_01]: asking that, you know, why, you know,
like probably should have been killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few times on that trip, but God's with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creator, thank you protecting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of those experiences,
I was on hippie hills smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We missed 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we got there way too late,
rolled into town, but we were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what, you know, a little bit later
rolled in and still is like very solo,
[SPEAKER_01]: but smoked my own joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably one of the most memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's history.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our history has been, you know,
so that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's different for people who live
closer, but like, I just thought that was
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in the Bay area and,
um, it was, uh, cannabis is a huge part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the culture there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, smoking up on hippie hill is
definitely something people should
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel grateful for having experienced the
little that I've experienced in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: eight or nine years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not.
[SPEAKER_01]: An OG or a legacy grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a new bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, I just happened to like whip in and
like work my way up and win some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, like I am so grateful to
have gotten and had the blessings that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had in such a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like your experience speaks
volume for your own capabilities as a
[SPEAKER_03]: grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, a lot of people can learn a
lot from yourself if they do want to enter
[SPEAKER_03]: into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just want to thank you so
much for your time today, telling your
[SPEAKER_03]: story and getting this information out
there to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like, I like to say, getting this
information out there to the community
[SPEAKER_03]: helps us all grow together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way we grow, uh,
just like, uh, the title of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
