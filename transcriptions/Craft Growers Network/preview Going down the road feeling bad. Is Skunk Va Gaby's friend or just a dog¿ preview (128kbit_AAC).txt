[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Gabby Staten Island coming to you
from beautiful California, and I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: another video that I want to make for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may have seen the short that I
put on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made an hour long podcast about the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I get into it, I wanted to make
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made the video about me and VA a
couple of weeks ago and didn't release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure that I got it all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, the other day,
I made a short video, 15 seconds on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, which got a pretty huge
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of it was positive, positive in
the sense of people were glad that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the news out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the topic is kind of negative,
and people were disappointed in VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did get a small amount of people
that said, Hey, you know, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that Instagram or YouTube is the place for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were saying that they didn't
know if I should do it on the craft
[SPEAKER_00]: growers network, because they felt that
I've been keeping it positive and having
[SPEAKER_00]: good stories and that this would bring it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to respond to those couple of
things prior to putting out this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I made this podcast channel,
my goal was to tell my story because
[SPEAKER_00]: people like not so dog who I love dearly
were quoting me or giving my opinion and
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing it exactly as I would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided to make my own podcast,
I decided that I wanted to tell my story
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a place where it lived forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, this grew beyond my
wildest dreams, where it's become a place
[SPEAKER_00]: for many people to tell their story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, the original goal was to
have a place to tell my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, something that you guys
don't know is that I'm also recording with
[SPEAKER_00]: my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I thought would be really
good to do would be to have my dad and my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandma and my aunts and uncles,
you know, record podcasts, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: private, where we talk about our family
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole idea would be to pass it to
future generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, my seven year old daughter
never got a chance to meet my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want her to know about my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell some stories, but I also wanted
my mom's mom to tell some stories and her
[SPEAKER_00]: sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: About them growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm lucky I have a 98 year old
grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked her if she would do this with
me and she said yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got really emotional about it,
was crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that she said was
that she didn't want to tell the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That she wanted to leave certain parts out
because they were sad stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, I don't even
know what she's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about my great
grandparents on my mom's side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know much about my
grandma's life when she was growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her, I said, hey, you know,
I understand that it's difficult,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I reminded her that on my dad's side,
pretty much everyone was wiped out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather and his brother and my
grandmother and her sister were the only
[SPEAKER_00]: ones from a very large family that were
able to escape the Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I told my grandma was,
hey, you know, the sad stories are
[SPEAKER_00]: important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just not tell the stories about
the Holocaust because it's sad,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in regards to me telling my story
the stuff that's not positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I can sugar coat my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can tell my story accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I wanna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I want to tell my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna document it so that I can remember
it and so that anyone that's interested
[SPEAKER_00]: can hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't just leave out negative stuff
or drama because people think it brings
[SPEAKER_00]: down the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be true to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I wanna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when I made this podcast,
one thing that I told myself, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a little bit of a defensive move,
was I said, I don't care if people like
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I'm making this for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, my opinion is that the
podcast became like a runaway hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten pretty much nothing but
positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that defensive mode,
like oh, people don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already so many people that enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't wanna do anything to turn
people off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I can't be true to myself
and be true to my story if I decide to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the sad parts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I'm gonna release this
podcast and if you guys don't wanna listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the drama, don't listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys will respect what I'm
trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the feedback that I've gotten from
my podcast is that people have told me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they feel that I'm genuine and that
they're getting to know who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not happy about something,
if I'm upset at somebody, those are all
[SPEAKER_00]: real feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I react and express this,
this is who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I wanna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna be genuine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna be true to my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you guys will listen to it and
not think that I'm bringing down the
[SPEAKER_00]: channel or my show too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I kinda feel like it's what I
gotta do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate, I've known Jason
since 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, even with all this, something that
I tell my kids, it's only people that you
[SPEAKER_00]: care about that can hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody was talking shit,
if somebody wronged me and I don't care
[SPEAKER_00]: about them, then it doesn't affect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you care about somebody the way I
do for VA skunk and they hurt you,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it hurts much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm gonna tell this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys will appreciate it for
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this channel to tell my story and I
haven't had a chance to do it because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been so involved in interviewing people
like Jorge Cervantes and Kevin Jodry and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the great people that we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to interview, but I am gonna try to
put a little bit more effort into telling
[SPEAKER_00]: my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to say I appreciate all you
guys for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you'll continue listening and
supporting our podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
