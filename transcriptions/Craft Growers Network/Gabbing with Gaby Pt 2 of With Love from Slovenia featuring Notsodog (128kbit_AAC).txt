[SPEAKER_03]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_03]: Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are the only place that you can
get the Gabby Staten Island Collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Gabby from the Craft Growers
Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joined with my co-host, Nick Wolf,
and my good friends, Not-So-Dog and Sasha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sasha is my hobbit brother from Slovenia,
is how he likes me to address him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we're super excited about this
show today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do part two of our
interview with Sasha.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we were talking a lot of
strain history, I decided to invite
[SPEAKER_03]: Not-So-Dog, who is a specialist at
conversing about these topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to get started right
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll let you continue saying what you
were saying before we started recording
[SPEAKER_03]: Not-So-Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, I was just saying like on the
on the other podcast and stuff that I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the whole goal of it was really to
just try to like bring like a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversational element to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because, you know, when you get
into when you get into weed or cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it, it's not
like you know anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you know what your friend group
knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start getting little bits and
pieces of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know how correct it is or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you start reading some like high
times or, you know, you get a hold of some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning, you don't really
know what's right and what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, for instance, going back to
like olden times, Gabby and I used to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: around his house and smoke joints and read
every entry in every seed catalog that
[SPEAKER_00]: existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like knowing nothing about those breeders
really or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to drool over, oh my God,
this thing's going to be done in six
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to think that like, you know,
breeding was like every line was like well
[SPEAKER_00]: done and well thought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would almost memorize that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would dream about going to Amsterdam,
you know, and a lot of the early strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no evidence behind any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just hearing the story from your
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be like as accurate or
wildly inaccurate as imaginable,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just some random stoner
telling you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, later, I mean, I used to
think when I used to read high times that
[SPEAKER_00]: every month I was gaining new knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm like horrified because because
there's so much in there that would like
[SPEAKER_00]: send you in the wrong direction,
you know, but you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like in Wikipedia, anyone can post.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually kind of the thing now
where it's like even with all the Internet
[SPEAKER_00]: and even with all the information out
there, it's you still need a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience to navigate what like is really
true and amazing and what is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, man, that is not what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it makes me think of how like
when you're like a beginner at almost
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, you're just like trying to
vacuum up as much knowledge as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you get to a certain point where
you have like a good standard of knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: and you start to feel like you know even
less than you should because of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: you've absorbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start looking at everything
skeptically and start to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I know that this other thing wasn't
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can I look at this with a skeptical
lens?
[SPEAKER_00]: In America, people talk about bro science,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the science of weed,
but like without like the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: method, but that's kind of like all we
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't so much like we were wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that like we couldn't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby and I couldn't go in 1998 or nine or
whatever and be like, what's wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like go to a university and be like,
oh, analyze this and see how different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we couldn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have any of like the tools
that you other people could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it ended up just being observation
and stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example of that is nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, you want to hear the classic
example?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to take the nicest nog out of the
sack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I when I was in high school and put it
in this resin chamber in my pipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that every time I smoked it,
I was getting hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that nice nog would be coated in
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I finally smoked it, it would be
better because it'd been infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like this was the top secret
tech like you'd buy a special pipe with a
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber that you could fit it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone thought you were cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like later on, obviously,
we realized that's garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like, that was well known
that was told to you they had a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes built for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a resin chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me think of the it makes me think
of the like millennium blunts or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: people would call them, where they would
take the roaches from all their joints or
[SPEAKER_01]: blunts and then roll them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it gets me higher because of all
the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of that kind of thing,
it's like you don't realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the crazy part for me,
too, is like, if you go back all the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the first books I bought,
like Rob Clark, Marijuana Botany or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give mad respect to that guy because
nobody even knew the information he put in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do you get a plant to flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are the different parts of the
plant do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they respond to stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when something's illegal and you
can't just go read about it, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like, you know, you have to figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask you a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so it's like, where did you get your
first cannabis seeds from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so that is interesting because Gabby
will laugh at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in high school, the only import
that I was aware of in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, because I was from Chicago,
right, which is like smack dab in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got green colored Mexican and brown
colored Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't I don't tell this story too
much, but like my I used to when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: high school, I used to sit in my room at
my parents house and like pick all the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and stems out of the weed that I had
bought and throw it out the window so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could clean it up before you used it
because it all came with seeds and stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my very first grow, I actually took a
picture because my parents just moved out
[SPEAKER_00]: of their house this last spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my very first grow was I was mowing my
parents lawn in spring and I came around
[SPEAKER_00]: the corner and lo and behold, underneath
my window where I've been throwing all
[SPEAKER_00]: these all this all the seeds and stems,
there was three or four Mexican cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants about two feet tall growing out of
the bushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they lived about before you notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just they lived about 15
seconds after I discovered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that lawnmower dude and I hammered
him as hard as I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had nowhere to put them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no one to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just knew that like if my mom or dad saw
it, I would be grounded for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, my first, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old were you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have been a sophomore or a junior
in high school at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 14, 15, 16, 16 right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to actually answer your question,
though, is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, Gabby and I used to go to dead shows,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Grateful Dead shows, there would be
people would bring their nice weed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: parking lot or to the concert and you
could bump into those people sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bumped into someone and I got what we
now call as kind bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very expensive and I didn't
know how to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that I knew that knew how to get
it was at Grateful Dead shows and all my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that I had back in Chicago,
they knew how to get Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, dude, when it comes to first
cannabis seeds, I went out to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty early because I didn't know
anywhere else to get good weed besides
[SPEAKER_00]: literally wandering around a Grateful Dead
parking lot and trying to make friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: going to Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first went to Amsterdam,
which was, I believe, the summer I turned
[SPEAKER_00]: 18, which would have been like 1994 or
something like that, I knew nothing about
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew enough because the high times I
knew that you could buy weed and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know there was a red light
district.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know there was smart shops that
you could buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walked in as like, dude,
as a Grateful Dead hippie kid walking into
[SPEAKER_00]: a shop where they had legally growing
living psychedelic mushrooms, like in a
[SPEAKER_00]: case, I was like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: They banned it after, you know,
because people went crazy a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're a touristic place.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing what you tell me now,
it happened to me in 95 or 96.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that time, we were planting
backseeds all the time, like you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Backseeds from all the weed that you could
back, you know, from from weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have seeds and then you make or,
you know, my cousin, he was like a really
[SPEAKER_05]: like he was a Hendrix fan and Jenny Joplin
fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like he marked it with
Hendrix and Joplin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, some remark about some
party or I don't know, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just to have a to have a breach that you
remember it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the weed, you know, on that
party.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it has this this smell or a
particular taste or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's how it went.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got so many different phenotypes,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every seed that you were putting in,
it turned out different.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, but then in 1995 or six,
I went to a pizzeria here in my town,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was the first stone oven pizzeria.
[SPEAKER_05]: A guy from Sicily came to make that
pizzeria, you know, the oven and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything to make this Italian style
Calabrese pizza, you know, and the guy
[SPEAKER_05]: that was the cook was a guy that traveled
all around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he came back to Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was Slovenian, but he was a cook on a
cruise ship, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he went he went everywhere,
you know, like in the 70s, 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was, you know, a cook on the ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well traveled.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he saw a lot of wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he came back, you know, he was the
first guy that put a catalog on the table
[SPEAKER_05]: when I was there for a pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, Hey, little one, you want to
see this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he put the catalog of sensi seeds,
catalog of 1994 or 93.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: The catalog was there, sensi seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had all of these, you know,
wheat strains with fucking all the data
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, like the like all we know
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next year, this guy had already,
it was in in German, because he got it in
[SPEAKER_05]: German.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to somewhere in Austria or
Germany, maybe at that time, because seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: were allowed at that time in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, there was a very big wheat scene
in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that time, you could buy there was so
much wheat in Switzerland until 2001 2001.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stopped in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were growing high potent THC flowers,
putting them into bags like, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: like you had pillows, they called them
pillows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said it's aroma therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, yeah, they were selling them
in few.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Switzerland is in three cantons.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you have the French speaking
canton, the German speaking canton and the
[SPEAKER_05]: old Roman speaking Italian and Roman.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, and in few contos,
they have this law that you could actually
[SPEAKER_05]: sell the the the wheat, the the bots for
aroma therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you get into this little shop,
they have buckets of kilo of wheat inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've said if you ask them what is
the best to smoke, they were not selling
[SPEAKER_05]: you nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is not for smoking,
they say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just for, you know, because this
aroma therapy, they sell you the pillows.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, behind of this was a really
big wheat scene, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in in America, we used to have
it used to be really hard to get stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in that era, it was really hard to
find the crappiest papers you could
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine at a gas station.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to drive to a different state,
Wisconsin, to even get pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you because it was all illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you went in like everybody,
everybody in America of a certain age,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you went in, you were buying the pipe
to smoke tobacco.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you so you had to call it a water
pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you called it a bong, like for smoking
weed, you could be an undercover cop
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get the store in trouble for
selling gear that was used for drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would throw you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would have big signs on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only ask for water pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not sell anything but for tobacco
use only water pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like even just saying the word bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would get you tossed out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: For us, this is totally on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would never happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would never they would never arrest
somebody for selling bongs or something
[SPEAKER_05]: because you have shops here that sell
cannabis plants in Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also have shops that are not
selling cannabis plants, but they sell all
[SPEAKER_05]: the other stuff for paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: All this, you know, they sell only for
consuming.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for example, in my shop, we don't sell
anything, not even papers, nothing to
[SPEAKER_05]: consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a gardening shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't sell, you know, we have you have
soils, fertilizers, we have seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have, you know, pots, we have,
you know, all kinds of stimulants,
[SPEAKER_05]: everything, mycorrhizal fungi,
everything, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't sell you bongs, papers,
something that you would consume wheat
[SPEAKER_05]: because this is not our way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a library of, you know,
makes a connection.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, we specialized on the
library, you know, to keeping genetics,
[SPEAKER_05]: keeping good genetics in a very good form.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also the old ones, which everybody
threw away in Austria in the last 10
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all the shops got rid of the old
cuts, which I was like crying for me was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, what are you doing, guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you forgot about the codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, they what I didn't
realize as a kid, and I think this is like
[SPEAKER_00]: true of almost anything is that I thought
that the weed scene would stay relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: static.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that, like every five
years, there was going to be a sea change
[SPEAKER_00]: in what you could get, what was available,
what would be common and easy would become
[SPEAKER_00]: rare, you know, or impossible or even
legendary as time went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I understand weed people and I've
spent my adult life in it, I get why
[SPEAKER_00]: things happen the way that they do and the
various things that get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can say from my experience,
people laugh at me, dude, because they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, how did you collect all these
amazing genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be like, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just hold on to things for years when
nobody else wants them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's the thing is it's like in all
cannabis scenes I've seen, everyone wants
[SPEAKER_00]: what's popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's easy to sell or move or grow at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens when something goes
through a period where people don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: it for a while?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not have anything to do about its
quality or whether you like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you might go through a period where
like it's just not popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people will dump whatever it is
if it's not popular and they just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold on to the things that are currently
in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what you were just saying,
where it's like there's, it's almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: a, I don't know what, when you want to
call it a disease or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well, I just, I just laugh that it's
like, I mean, I literally, because I live
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendo and I had the ability to,
I just started holding onto things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I, we, I'd grow whatever it was
that needed for the market, but then we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have a section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, Gabby and I were
talking about it the other day,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that he's really famous for
bringing the chem dog west to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never cropped a ton of chem dog because
it was really ugly and most brokers didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would grow it for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would grow a few pounds for like us and
our friends and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were typically growing something
else to make the market happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on people were like,
Oh my God, you have this legendary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, it was so legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a hundred percent true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people that had smoked it,
people that wanted to smoke, they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but people that wanted to buy a weed
to sell, it was a little bit risky because
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't as just like today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it wasn't as pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legitimately it's, I mean,
it's like, like I have bulldogs and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like so ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cute, you know, but that's kind of
like the, that's kind of like the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, like it, but to me it's like all weed
looks the same when you roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is my point too.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second thing is I believe in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabby last time told me another theory
like, you know, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: we are all the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you have sex with a woman that is
not physically attractive to other guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe to me it is, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my own taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, you know, that's a funny
analogy, dude, because I actually say
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, I think there's like,
there's, there's weed out here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really gorgeous and doesn't do
anything for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll joke to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having a super hot girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really mean to you, you know,
like everybody else is oppressed and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're all like so pumped that you
pulled this girl and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, she actually isn't, she doesn't treat
me very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she might be pretty to look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brother, brother, you suffer, you suffer,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you were with her,
you actually suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody thinks you are enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, no, it's not like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when it comes to humans,
80% of like our nerve and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much connectivity between our
eyes and our brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our eyes for people are way better
than our nose or our sense of taste or our
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically like, our species is
really about here, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like visually, things are really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see social media,
you can't see, you can't see like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you can't sniff it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke it, but you can see it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even think talking about those
catalogs high times went in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties, late eighties from like very
poor pictures to probably by like the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you and I were talking about it,
full glossy pictures in the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine of white widow and great white
shark and Cali mist and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would drool over those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would look at these pictures of these
buds and just be entranced by like,
[SPEAKER_00]: could I get that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, brother, it is like also,
yeah, we didn't have internet at that
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have cell phones, you know,
we have to tell people also this in mind
[SPEAKER_05]: that there was no internet, there was no
phones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you basically was on your own
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw what you saw from year to year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you made a picture and then
everything else, you know, over grow.com
[SPEAKER_05]: when that shit came, you know,
we were all there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so I think to Gabby, you were there
over grow.com before it dropped.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2006 it dropped, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was four, I think maybe there was
this, there was this seed seller in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: called heaven's stairway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that was to heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the play on Led Zeppelin song or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got raided by the by the
government for selling tons of seed
[SPEAKER_00]: because the big market is always America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these seed companies, they all get
in trouble for sending tons of seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that overgrow and
cannabis world were both tied into that
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they got busted, like the two
forums that everybody was on and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating fell off because the parent
company that owned it all of a sudden was
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there was, I mean,
Mark Emery, Mark Emery, who used to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis culture magazine in the back of
the magazine would be like a two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: page, you know, catalog of everything he
was selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was where I mean, we had to,
you know, that that was where you got
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wish that all of the stuff that
like we had done when we were younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like put a pack or two of everything
I bought in the freezer for later me
[SPEAKER_00]: because I blew through so much stuff,
picking, choosing, killing males,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of anything I didn't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize that, like,
I wouldn't be able to go back later on and
[SPEAKER_00]: get that same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the stuff that, you know,
when I was talking about the catalog,
[SPEAKER_05]: that the guy showed us, you know,
at that time, we started to buy seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: never bought seeds before from from a
catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those genetics, not only we bought it
and we have the same thing like you,
[SPEAKER_05]: we lost things and but other people like
like lucky when I was telling you from the
[SPEAKER_05]: last podcast, you know, he was also having
some of these strains, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the skunk number one, for example,
he bought in those times in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my guys had like a selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the number 11 and the number 16
was very popular in the clone form in the
[SPEAKER_05]: underground scene when it was grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people tell me now it was all skunk
number one, but they were very different
[SPEAKER_05]: from each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was another one which was
actually very recessive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the stripes like you see on Dr.
Greenspoon pictures today, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: this kind of, you know, when you have the
plant, you just have the sack underneath,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, where the one seed should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the whole bot was consisting only from
these little sacks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, it was stripes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We called them the they called it the some
Jerry, some something with Jerry,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, the genetics that came from
those three years, I think you told in
[SPEAKER_05]: another podcast that those was those was
naval stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stock that was still from naval because it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, after since it bought the seed bank,
they have still his stock, which they
[SPEAKER_05]: directly sold, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't realize that for the longest
time, but from basically from when they
[SPEAKER_00]: bought his stock in 1991 till about 1995,
they literally just sold seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville had already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first four years that since he
was selling all that, that's making any
[SPEAKER_00]: new stuff, they were just selling like
what Neville had already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they ran, when they started
running low, they hired him again and he
[SPEAKER_00]: came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where like the the Jack Herrera
and the black Domina and some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that they started adding new
stuff to the catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get a ninety one, ninety two,
ninety three, ninety four edition sensei
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog, it's literally the exact same
listing of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: No change.
[SPEAKER_05]: One question.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would have somebody in the world
now that is listening, if he has a pack
[SPEAKER_05]: from ninety one till ninety five,
for example, of sensei seeds in his fridge
[SPEAKER_05]: or even not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, they probably probably
they are not going to sprout.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the question for you, not so would it
sprout with the help of gibberellic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that if it was if it was
stored well, there is a chance that it
[SPEAKER_00]: will sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's stored poorly or something
happens to it like physically,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of yeah, that's kind of a
tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gabby and I did all this work,
all this breeding work for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lost mine in an unfortunate event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he was on vacation in Jamaica
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had all of his stuff in a fridge or
freezer and the breaker popped,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I remember right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just the seeds got hot in a
garage for X number of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've taken 20, 30 year old seeds and
I've gotten some of them to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just depends on how they're stored.
[SPEAKER_05]: Temperature that is not fluctuating too
much from plus to minus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is something stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll tell a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I told it a little while ago,
but I'll tell a different version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first moved out to California,
my ex, my ex lady with the reason why we
[SPEAKER_00]: moved is she had cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we moved out to Mendocino County
because it was like the most California
[SPEAKER_00]: passed the first laws in America where if
you were sick, you could have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had just done that the year
before in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ended up planning in 97 to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved in 98 and I had a friend that
blew glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he realized that like blowing glass,
like spraying all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spraying all that golden silver on your
pipes was unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hired this old H this old like HVAC
heating and air conditioning guy to help
[SPEAKER_00]: us build like a hood and like all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little bit more professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he ended up being sick with cancer
and I felt really bad for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind of poor to be perfectly
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was kind of struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was going through it with my ex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I gave him a quarter pound of weed
or something and some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him, you know, don't even worry
about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just hopefully it makes you feel
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he felt so, he wanted to do
something for me, but he didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: anything really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time I saw him, he brought me
a couple of seeds in a, in a medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, man, he's like,
I, these have just been in my closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to grow weed a million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what you'll find of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sprout these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes out the most, the only, the only one
that lived came out the most beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up being called what now what
we call the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I brought it back to him and he was
like, Oh my God, this is the point of the
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it back to him and he was like,
Oh man, I only grew purple weed once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in the summer of 77 in
Kovala, which is this podunk little town
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really like the moral of that is
that those seeds, when he gave them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 22 or something and the seeds were
21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had 21 year old seeds and he had just
tossed them in like a cool closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on his mountain house and he lived on
like the, when you live on like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast side of a mountain up in the
Hills, you don't get very much sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, it's like, you really don't
like, and he lived in the woods kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause he was a logger and some trees or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, yeah, I took 21 year old
seeds at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Nepalese, but I, I'm just
guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why I say that is
because once I met like real collectors in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland, I started getting taken back to
their flats or their apartments or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would like smoke weed with me and
we would chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nicest hash they had was they were
all trading these Nepalese temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They felt like that was the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smoked that it tasted to me
like the Mendo P, but I have no idea what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do think, I do think it's that
old too, because it's really low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of fits that era of cannabis,
you know, in the sense that like most
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the seventies was between
seven and 12%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, and so it tests kind of
like between eight and 12, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Gabby and I actually became
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and when, like, when we first started
becoming good friends, me and my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean, who's passed, we left a couple of
joints of the Mendo P on like Gabby's
[SPEAKER_00]: windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember like on his windshield or
something like that and left our number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, yeah, that's literally how we,
we, that's, that's literally how we became
[SPEAKER_00]: friends is we talked all this stuff and we
wanted to leave them a little gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we left them a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, you can improperly store
seeds and then you might need like
[SPEAKER_00]: embryonic recovery or something that's
beyond my pay grade to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it through like tissue culture
and you can pull the embryo out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to find somebody to help us get
this done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, this is, this is the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the not so dog got his name right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I, um, we, Gabby and I did a
ton of breeding together and through a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of unfortunate events, a bunch of
it got lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what got survived at Gabby's went
through a heat treatment and we would
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost a rest in a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, uh, I want to change direction real
fast, but before I do, I wanted to say
[SPEAKER_03]: that, uh, I thought the question that
Sasha was going to ask was if you could go
[SPEAKER_03]: back in time and get any one pack of seeds
that you could from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, the answer would be sensey
seeds, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's like not even a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's other ones like that I'd
really want, but if I, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you had to be on a desert Island and
you could only bring one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sensey seed, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have two or three, but,
but yeah, that would be, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to choose one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Sasha was asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a, I mean, what's funny
about it too is the way seeds are is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could go buy a bunch of legendary seed
and get all crap or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one pack and find a gem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, the super skunk from
Neville was so consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to hold the magazine up against
our flower, every crop and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abby and I, we had, I think it was the
1990, uh, seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, had a nice big picture of super skunk,
but, and it was the first year it was
[SPEAKER_00]: released and you could take a side Nug off
the super skunk that Gabby gave me and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could hold it up to that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had picked the bud that he had used to
take that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like, it was, it was a,
we used to joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a perfect example,
but it was also, it was also a bust
[SPEAKER_00]: because Gabby has a different memory than
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember having carbon filters
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like, I would have,
I mean, I don't know that I didn't buy
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I remember like those like ozone
generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember having an ozone generator and
then venting and then having like it go
[SPEAKER_00]: through 25 or 30 feet of ducting before it
went out the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when that, that super skunk was a
bust, that turp that everybody's after
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That exact picture, that turp that
everybody is after right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a stank up your whole house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stank your stank outside your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like pull up to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when I lived in that red house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of Willets, Gabby, I would pull up
to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pull out of, I would pull into my
driveway with my windows down and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, and like, it wasn't that chill to
have that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, yeah, I didn't even see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to like choose joined us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do want to, I want to make it a
little bit more of a Sasha story time
[SPEAKER_03]: where we ask questions because I've been
talking to him, you know, you missed last
[SPEAKER_03]: week when he was talking about the Santa
Maria Plunk and then also the Shiva that
[SPEAKER_03]: he has.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want you to be involved in that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in the last few days, he's been
telling me stories about traveling to
[SPEAKER_03]: Mongolia and finding weed there,
and then also carrying his ice water hash
[SPEAKER_03]: bags throughout Spain and, and making hash
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the purpose of this is to
let Sasha tell some of his story.
[SPEAKER_05]: The short version of Mongolia,
for example, you know, started to study in
[SPEAKER_05]: Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a really good friend, which is still
a really good friend today of mine,
[SPEAKER_05]: a brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, you know, having like a night where we
were getting drunk and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: then we have this idea, where are we going
to travel together?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, you know, we're going to travel
this summer because we have like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, between the studies,
you have time, you know, he said,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is nothing and to Mongolia by a
plane ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have an invitation letter from a
guy that lived in Ulaanbaatar.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the, the capital of Mongolia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was in 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2001 that I was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a weed head before that already,
you know, in the nineties, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, this was just like if traveling,
you know, like do some shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: some crazy shit in your life that then you
will never forget.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unforgettable experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we were two months in Mongolia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hitchhiking horses, you know,
no, you know, you have, you have like the
[SPEAKER_05]: capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like they don't have like
public transportation there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you have it, but it's not,
there is no roads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they are, they are them on the stars
and on, you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so vast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like three time of France is
Mongolia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's 2 million people like Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's like, I mean, and 1
million of people live, live at that time
[SPEAKER_05]: in Ulaanbaatar in the capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like, uh, the only land world
that did not have possession of land
[SPEAKER_05]: because they are nomadic people that hang
around, you know, like where the ass is,
[SPEAKER_05]: then the cattle will be fed and,
you know, continue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very harsh environment to live
in really harsh, but you have certain me
[SPEAKER_05]: when I was traveling there, 18 years,
18 years old or 90, 19, 19 years,
[SPEAKER_05]: 18 to 19.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 19 at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, we are many places in
Mongolia, like in the South, in Gobi
[SPEAKER_05]: desert, and then in the capital,
of course, in Ulaanbaatar first and
[SPEAKER_05]: traveling North and North is a goal of
elevation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have sea, which is drinkable
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, you know, in Russia, there is
this Baikal Lake is one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: lakes in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So South of Baikal Lake is a lake called
Hovsgor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hovsgor Nur it's called Hovsgor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like 40 kilometers in or 30
kilometers and 50, 60 kilometers long
[SPEAKER_05]: lake.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's 1% of all the drinkable water
supplies on earth there in this lake.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the way to this lake, there is a
town called Erdenet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this town, you know, we were
walking, you know, this was 2001 and my
[SPEAKER_05]: body and another friend were traveling,
you know, together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were like walking through,
you know, this little town, the white
[SPEAKER_05]: guys, you know, and because we are
Slovenians, we stand a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: Russian because it's like, I don't speak
Russian, but it's a Slavic language.
[SPEAKER_05]: My language is a Slavic language group.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand Russian because I don't
know to speak Mongolian.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like Mongolian is a really
difficult language.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hungarians have among Mongol root of
language, like near me, where I live.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a really, it's a Ungro-Finnish
group of languages.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, to go to wheat, you know,
I'm too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wheat is grown in Mongolia to the border
to Russia.
[SPEAKER_05]: From that lake on, there is wild feral,
which is actually out of flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the basis of actually out of flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a Siberian type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It grows there in abundance.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot even know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is white trees, you know,
how you call them in English.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is this white trees with white,
you know, they have this white skin and
[SPEAKER_05]: then it's only cannabis underneath.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have this Aspen forest in Siberia,
which are like, you can drive with the
[SPEAKER_05]: train through the Trans-Siberian.
[SPEAKER_05]: You drive days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Through these forests, so much of that
wood is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to understand how big this area
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's vast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, Mongolia and then it's
Kazakhstan next to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kazakhstan is really huge also.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, and these areas are so
uninhabited.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that live there, they don't know
about cannabis or even if they do,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a total different approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be ruderalis?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is absolutely ruderalis, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like, it never grows more than
40 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's knees maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's flowering because it has no
flowering time because of the short winter
[SPEAKER_05]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short, we have the short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to get, it has to do it quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And THC levels are really low.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that is weird that there's maybe,
I don't know, 5%, 4%, something like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just get to smoke more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extract it, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's growing wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, like it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have access.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it's interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody talks about land races,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which that obviously would be just like
wild, feral populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think most people realize how
much work it would be to like take a land
[SPEAKER_00]: race and bring it into something that like
modern style we would consider to be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a lot of work, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times we're just taking work
that's already been done for decades prior
[SPEAKER_00]: with different people and adding our own
little flavor to it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you want to take,
like you were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: like some haze weed that had just like one
little calyx, two little calyx,
[SPEAKER_00]: three little calyx, you know, just big
enough for one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what growers want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have to take that and like breed
it into something and over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like hard to reinvent the wheel
because the wheel takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but so did you, was there people
selling weed in Mongolia?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no one.
[SPEAKER_05]: They give it to us, you know, we were
smoking joints in newspaper, no smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: papers there, you know, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like even cigarettes were rolled in
newspaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, of course now it's 2024 and it's a
different story.
[SPEAKER_05]: To also know that at that time,
80% of the population was under 20 years
[SPEAKER_05]: old when I was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they died.
[SPEAKER_05]: 80% of the population was under 20 years
and 2,400,000 people was in all Mongolia.
[SPEAKER_05]: The land is like three times front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just huge grasslands going off in every
direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, 27 million in the land,
you know, they have 2 million people,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they have 27 million horses because
this is the land of the horse.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they live with horses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They survive with horse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is with horse.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the culture is about horses and the
history is about Genghis Khan and the
[SPEAKER_05]: conquering and everything, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of the stories,
you know, in Indonesia where I was,
[SPEAKER_05]: the wheat is there is absolutely illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I didn't smoke wheat there for a
year that I was living there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't smoke wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even search for it, you know,
because it's so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is wheat there in north of
Sumatra is feral cannabis, sativa,
[SPEAKER_05]: high in THC and they use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is that in Indonesia they use it
also in kitchen for food as a medicine,
[SPEAKER_05]: as a herb, they put into the food as a
traditional food in north Sumatra called
[SPEAKER_05]: Banda Aceh, the region.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very orthodox country Indonesia,
but in Banda Aceh, they are the most
[SPEAKER_05]: orthodox.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have jungle there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiva is there, you know, it's kind of
sativa that is there feral, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's so forbidden in Indonesia to
consume cannabis even or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, if you don't like
your life, then you have deal,
[SPEAKER_05]: then you deal some cannabis in Indonesia
because they get killed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you get killed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's death penalty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Death penalty.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even tourists, you know, that smuggled
cannabis through, you know, there was
[SPEAKER_05]: cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't talk about this now, but there is
cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so hardcore penalties that is like
you don't, you don't, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the land, you know, I travel there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not traveling, you know, then I need
wheat, you know, all the time when I was
[SPEAKER_05]: traveling, you know, when wheat,
the wheat, it was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was no wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was just no wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you live your life, you know,
it's also a great experience because
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not so alike.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, I like it when there is
wheat, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, in the nineties,
you also when being there for us is the
[SPEAKER_05]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go there, you know it from the
catalogs, you know it from the seed banks,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's like, wow, I've been
waiting for this moment so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I buy bubble bags there in 2005
or something when I was second time there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, bubble bags from from
bubble man, you know, for the ice water,
[SPEAKER_05]: the harsh technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're talking about like your,
your worldly travel, Sasha, where is the
[SPEAKER_01]: craziest place that you found weed and
were able to smoke it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mongolia.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the craziest place I saw wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, that it even exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like, where was it like something
where because it sounds like in Mongolia,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't but but for people to have to
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like wildly growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like was there any place where you didn't
expect to find weed that you found it
[SPEAKER_01]: other than Mongolia?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and but like found it in like a
smokeable, not just growing out there in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere I travel there was cannabis
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Antarctica, it does not have
wheat, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but all of all the you know, but wheat is
everywhere, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wheat is all around the globe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's so spread now, because wheat
actually controls us, the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: We die, we become the food for those
plants, then, actually, they eat us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes people are like this in the
romantic fashion that like you are like
[SPEAKER_05]: have you are the whisperer of the plant or
something, you know, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, yeah, you can be the whisperer,
but she will eat you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there's this,
there's this cool book, it's old now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's called the botany of desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by this guy, Michael Palan,
and it's a plant's eye view of the world.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of like focusing on us,
it focuses on like, which plants used us
[SPEAKER_00]: to spread all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is one of his main examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other ones is apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because apples just come from
Kazakhstan, like you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they and apples used humans to go
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they exist everywhere where they
used to exist just in this one zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting to like think
about it from like, well, what does the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant want from us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what cannabis gets from us is
we have spread it all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like when people were growing hemp,
hemp was one of the main things that
[SPEAKER_00]: sailors used to make rope and sails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read that most sailing expeditions
would have hemp seed in case they got
[SPEAKER_00]: shipwrecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could grow a crop and turn the hemp
into fiber so they could make sails or
[SPEAKER_00]: they could make ropes and they could try
to get the hell out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could make rafts, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hemp seed and taking cannabis with
them was important to sailors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably also useful as a trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, yeah, you can trade,
you can make, you can grow this thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make ropes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they brought it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of like, it seems like
it went everywhere based on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as wherever sailors went,
it went to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it was spread actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the first seeds that we got
here, you know, before we went to
[SPEAKER_05]: Amsterdam and the catalogs, it was
actually land races because our guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, here from Yugoslavia,
they could travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were not under Russian administration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yugoslavia was its own land.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were the independent, you know,
the ones that, you know, I told you last
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast already about this little bit,
but we could travel all Africa,
[SPEAKER_05]: all Asia almost because we were,
you know, Tito is the leader of Yugoslavia
[SPEAKER_05]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like a superstar, you know,
like a God.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a really, really good friend of
Haile Selassie the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was pals and Tito was like that,
you know, into Tito's funeral,
[SPEAKER_05]: all Hollywood came, you know, all,
all everybody from all the leaders of the
[SPEAKER_05]: world came for his funeral because
Yugoslavia was at that time, everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: knew what will happen because it was,
you know, and then when I was young,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was one car in America from
Yugoslavia, the Yugo, the Yugo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they sold the Yugo over here and
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap and efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only car I've ever seen in my
life where the backseat was an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could get one without a backseat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could just be, you know, like it was
there, but yeah, it could just be,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so yeah, but you know,
it was affordable and you could get from A
[SPEAKER_05]: to B, you know, story of Yugo,
but actually here it's a national,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like a Yugo was the only car,
you know, that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I have a question for you then,
right, which is kind of related to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the whole, when I first went there
was before the Euro where everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the countries had like their own
currencies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there'd be Deutschmarks in Germany or
there'd be Gilder, in Holland or Franck's
[SPEAKER_00]: in France or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when I first started going,
like the iron curtain had just fallen and
[SPEAKER_00]: like Eastern and Western Europe had been
sort of separated by politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or governments for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once that started opening up,
you know, like what were you restricted
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were young from like going to
like West Western Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, never, never.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go wherever you wanted.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the difference between Yugoslavia
and other countries that was under Russian
[SPEAKER_05]: administration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of, for example, Poland, Czech
Republic, Czechoslovakia at that time,
[SPEAKER_05]: countries were under Russian
administration.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could not travel to the West,
but me, but you could, I could because
[SPEAKER_05]: West was here like few meters away from my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did that, was there, as far as weed
goes, when that opened up, was there like
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of exchange and different things
going on because all of a sudden Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: was like more integrated?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, interesting thing, you know,
we never exported weed to, to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like, you know, I mean,
some people did, but it's like more or
[SPEAKER_05]: less weed from Albania.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was your Mexican for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was kind of getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was your weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where, where, where was weed being
able to be grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when things opened up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is, you know, Albania it's in a
place called, you can Google YouTube it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's a place in Albania that was
really growing amounts of cannabis under
[SPEAKER_05]: also, you know, the government knew for
that Albania was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they, you know, this, this place was so
poor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before it grew weed, that it became the
most place in, in Albania.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were growing so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole village grew, the whole
surrounding, all the village grew weed and
[SPEAKER_05]: the neighboring villages also did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then politics pressure on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course it was shut down after some
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, if Amarat was shut down,
that does not mean you know, that other
[SPEAKER_05]: places are still operating, but it pops
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is only that these people,
you know, they have genetics maybe that
[SPEAKER_05]: were good there to grow and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is for the transport to,
to, you know, to get to certain places in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe, they were using like fuel tanks of
trucks and, you know, and then the weed
[SPEAKER_05]: was like, you know, that you could smell
the, the, the fuel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, it was totally seeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never consumed this in my life because I
was always an enthusiast, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the nineties already, I was home
grower, you know, and in the forest also I
[SPEAKER_05]: have my patches as a guerrilla grower,
you know, I, uh, economy was like
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine, you know, you cannot do this
with medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you, let me ask you a
question then when you were growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods, you know, and all that,
like early on, like, um, when did the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: need to finish before your weather got so
bad that it was like, cause you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it varies obviously, depending on where
you live in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some, some places it's really
hard to like get weed to finish in other
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot warmer and a little bit nicer
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, when did, when did weed
finish for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of weed were you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you getting Amsterdam seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you getting Holland seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you trying to grow local stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you, this is a very interesting
because, uh, you know, in our places,
[SPEAKER_05]: the, in three was the winter came earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cold temperatures were not like now
that you have in October, for now,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we have in October, we have a
weather like California does, like we can
[SPEAKER_05]: grow late strains for, for my perception,
which was in, when I start to grow weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could not grow that kind of late.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to finish until end of September
because then the rain came, you have mold
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also there is another thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started to realize that there is some
strains, some genetics that is also
[SPEAKER_05]: produced in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of those companies or two,
I will mention now one of us, the Alpine
[SPEAKER_05]: seed company and the other one was green
Hornet.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was from both of them were from
Switzerland and they used genetics that
[SPEAKER_05]: finished earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were bred in the mountains outside in
Switzerland in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, famous strains of Switzerland is
called air barely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called strawberry, strawberry,
you know, that's where the strawberry
[SPEAKER_05]: comes actually from, because this is the
air badly.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was grown in the nineties in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a very fast finishing indica
strawberry plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had no mold, no issues with mold
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was absolute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a very fast rooting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good for production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And presumably they found it.
[SPEAKER_05]: On a field because they could grew fields
of plants at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the selections was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: People who was doing this are,
uh, was national already at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's had opportunities.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Shanti Baba, when he moved from
Amsterdam, where, where did he go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland, of course, because the
opportunity was there until 2001.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could, I think he's still in
Switzerland and I don't know, but he made
[SPEAKER_05]: a legal business.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a legal producer now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a legal business in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because he, he was in that time
also when it still was legal before the
[SPEAKER_05]: illegalization with the criminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Gabby and I used to go to these
like harvest festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Festival might be a big word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest gatherings where a bunch of
growers would like, they'd rent,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd rent a huge house and everybody
would bring their weed and they would all
[SPEAKER_00]: talk shop kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still early enough that like
overgrown cannabis world hadn't been shut
[SPEAKER_00]: down yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll always remember there was these
guys, one of them was this gentleman named
[SPEAKER_00]: Chip, who later on made the soil company
called Royal Gold in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had gone to Switzerland right when
they first opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always remember he had these
pictures because in America it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had these pictures of himself standing
in these fields and in these huge
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, like with his hands up like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see that he was just in this,
you know, football field sized greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: full of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll always remember like at that time
that was, that was the biggest I'd never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen weed grown on that scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard about a strain from
Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was originated from Switzerland called
purpurea tichinensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, purpurea tichinensis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very often that people stump the
genetic experts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can Google it purpurea tichinensis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a little bit of outlier from hemp
fields, I think, you know, it was very
[SPEAKER_05]: low, low actually, but it was found in
some Alps region in the Switzerland region
[SPEAKER_05]: of Alps.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lady that had a really old garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can Google that story.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pupurea tichinensis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will tell you that story.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was found in a garden patch of an old
lady.
[SPEAKER_05]: A characteristic of this strain that it
has really red stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has no deficiency, but it has really
bloody, poor, poor red stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland breeders tried to breed with
it and they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did many, many crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: To get these red stems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it has not red stems, it has green
stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the red stems, these poor,
poor red stems, popular in 90s,
[SPEAKER_05]: early 1000s.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you Google this, then you will find
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not high THC strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really low THC strain actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for breeding purposes, that you want
to take some certain phenotypic
[SPEAKER_05]: characteristics and, you know,
to want to have it in your line,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to repeat it with a combination
of... It was adapted to the mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was adapted to the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would grow well for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was adapted to the region.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it finished in, I mean, in the
beginning of September already,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it was so fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Erdberle, you know, like Erdberle
was also absolutely really fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then those guys from Alpine Seeds,
you know, which is a guy, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: can show you a book again, because I'm a
book lover.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a book called Der Cannabis Zucht,
which means Encyclopedia of Breeding,
[SPEAKER_05]: a guy that is called Mike Mott.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy who is Mike Mott is actually
one of the main guys from Alpine Seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: from that company, that it was Switzerland
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also had some, you know, they had
this Larry, lemon Larry OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they had like some cams also,
but they don't have the cam dog,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, they had some really
good genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were really on the right path having
having a production of regular seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and then green hornet also.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was also some others.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know these two for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They there is a Bushman Sativa clone that
is still circulating in Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Bushman Sativa clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's one of the things maybe I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out of left field for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to talk genetics,
tell me, OK, we're just sitting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are what are what are your favorite
genetics over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are legendary clones for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are things that you really love that
you wish you could have again or that
[SPEAKER_00]: still exist out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were famous clones that were passed
around and grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in America we have our own list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with with Hollis, Holland and
Amsterdam and different things getting
[SPEAKER_00]: passed around and all that, you guys have
your own stuff and they're not exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same by any means.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like what are what are the things like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you name some famous strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will know that were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name some famous stuff that people really
liked over there that had their like time
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell you, for example, for the scene of
Austria now, you know, because in Austria
[SPEAKER_05]: is a legal market of cannabis clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have them as ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sell them as my company does as a
B2B supplier to other shops or,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to a private person,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was so many shops already.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this Plank Santa Maria I got
from another shop when I was a customer
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So but I am an enthusiast and I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as I tell you, the strains that
you like, you keep in your library.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how until today it's still
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a clone called, you know,
Jagan.
Jagan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a big producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jagan is a clone of Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: A strain from Senses Seeds, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jagan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jagan was found.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jagan, you know, for you maybe to read.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we call it Jagan and Jagan was a clone
only that was produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: A guy named Dr. Knospe found it and Dr.
Knospe is the founder of a forum in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany called Hansburg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that guy died very early or continued
years after he passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he had, you know, he it was just
written that he slept or woke up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they found him, you know, maybe he had
a stroke, a brain stroke or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not tell because there are people
out there maybe who listen now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm somebody who never met him,
who never.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know his clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like my story of the Shiva,
the lucky clone is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: These people are they passed away.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for your place, Mandel, Mandelbrot,
you know, or somebody, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: People left something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the guys who are, you know,
who are like minded like us now,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you're like if you get that
genetic, of course, I will be the
[SPEAKER_05]: librarian again, you know, I will keep it
forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will until I die.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hopefully somebody keeps it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jagan is one plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from Jagan was Grüne Hessein,
the green Hessein was a really big
[SPEAKER_05]: producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Grüne Hessein is a offspring of Jagan
because somebody had Jagan plants and they
[SPEAKER_05]: were pollinated by a warlock male.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Warlock was by Magus Genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a company that then Simon from
Sirius took under his, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: he took the genetics because I don't know,
Magus in one moment was not Magus again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the strains for Magus was with
Sirius seeds, you know, in one moment.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this Grüne Hessein was even a bigger
yielder, Jagan.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jagan is a beast when you see it on
seed fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the production, but I don't like
my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has this, it was a sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a really sativa flavor and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, you know, for example,
that is also not my cup of tea,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it was called Ivory.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a clone only.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just called Ivory.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also find it to the seed finder.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was clone only.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ivory.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a really like taste like,
I mean, it tastes like mushrooms and it
[SPEAKER_05]: was, it was purple, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have the Mendo perps,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: For strain, for example, called Shaman
from Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My guys from mountain region grew it a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was a, you know, this low THC
sativa with really purple, purple buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sell it today as the regulars also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's one of the only genetics that
is still really original with Dutch
[SPEAKER_05]: Passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to insult nobody or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like none of the, none of the
seed companies ever like to admit that
[SPEAKER_05]: their mix has changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's not a problem for me to,
you know, I will not go in details now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not the guy, you know, who will like,
like others that the genetics are not the
[SPEAKER_05]: same, but I know that they are not the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 plus years ago, something like that,
I can't remember who they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Gabby had some good friends of his and
they gave us a warlock cut and we grew the
[SPEAKER_00]: warlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew the warlock for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know where it came from or
whatever they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a black Domina too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something else I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were some friends of his from Sonoma,
but yeah, the warlock, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Sasha, if, um, if you could get
one strain back that you've lost over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the two male plants from yeti OG that
I got from Lumpa farms, little pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother Ziggy that makes these papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told last time this is Ziggy papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to Colorado in 2015 or 14,
uh, before the legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's a, he sold his papers there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So somehow he got these seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it was little pack with this ape,
you know, a Lumpa farms, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, uh, for me, you have to understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never tasted OG before because
everything on the market in Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: what was called OG at that time,
when you already had it, it was not OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_05]: When was this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, didn't you just say, yeah,
yeah, 2014 for 15.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because 14, uh, uh, everything is like,
I was already, because I was a enthusiast
[SPEAKER_05]: of other strains, you know, Switzerland,
ultra races, you know, like I told you
[SPEAKER_05]: early and then the amnesia, we grow a lot,
you know, the, the, the core cut that is
[SPEAKER_05]: circulating still in Austria, high pro,
uh, genetics is from high pro.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talked to Shanti also about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, you know, still a rose,
you know, for silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a really nice phenotype to the
conclusion that is, uh, yet your G,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, you know, is from a pack of seeds that
Ziggy from USA, from Colorado brought them
[SPEAKER_05]: and had them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he called me, uh, his place and,
you know, I got something really
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting for you because actually you
will be the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that we'll do something with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gave me a few packs, not only that,
because he was the guy that also made,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, for Soma.
[SPEAKER_05]: He made packs like, like that,
you know, and then inside hidden here,
[SPEAKER_05]: hidden Soma and Ziggy are friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are Rasta culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Soma and business with Ziggy at that
time, because that were sold and you had
[SPEAKER_05]: like seven or five seats in, in the back
also in the pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: By Soma seats.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a pack here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I can show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Soma, uh, Ziggy sold at that time,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these packs were, um, were seeds also.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ziggy is the guy who gave me the yeti
OG seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I heard about this before what
Lumpa farms, which seed company,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I'm a nerd and I Google it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I wanted to know everything
about them because when I, I got three
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and another friend of Ziggy also got
three seeds from the other one.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got three males and I got two males and
one female.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was only one female in six seats.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had no selection, nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just the only one plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the yeti OG that we knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, it had golf ball, hard nuggets,
stinky as, uh, I mean not stinky,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it had a, this certain, certain aroma,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain aroma.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never smelled something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never even saw a plant like this before,
because it was so aesthetic for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, wow, it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the world picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the corners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the darker leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it is, and then, you know,
uh, while a clone, you know, at my
[SPEAKER_05]: facility, but it was very lanky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really fucked, you know,
like what, you know, but I threw away the
[SPEAKER_05]: two males because when I grew this,
you know, there was two males,
[SPEAKER_05]: I threw them away, you know, like,
okay, that's two males.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that plant actually, uh, you know,
I realized genetics at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started to study Mendel, you know,
the first and the second and the third
[SPEAKER_05]: rule of Mendel, you know, the genetic
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kept the plant and we crossed it to
skunk the ace gear to double crush male.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I keep and everything that comes out is
actually very dominant in the yeti.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had a very big selection and the
yeti OG that I have now in my facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now is not really Lumpa farm yeti OG,
but it's a Lumpa farm yeti OG crossed to
[SPEAKER_05]: double crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I just looked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think yeti OG is a back cross of a
headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know, yeah, yeah, you, you know,
this plant with, uh, with bent and I know
[SPEAKER_05]: not so from all your talks in the podcast,
that is one of your favorites.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are a few, one of the hard
parts about the American weed group is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we make nicknames for everything and
we're not very good at like lineage or
[SPEAKER_00]: any, like we, so it's like one group can
call something one name and then it'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: shifted to another group and they'll have
a different nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can get really difficult to
figure things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people sometimes rename things to
create confusion, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I'm not supposed to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't call it this, but I'll call it
that and they won't figure it out type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you do like strain history,
like I do, it gets really difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: because basically like every American
group of dudes that like to smoke weed
[SPEAKER_00]: like nicknames.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Lumpa headband, in my opinion,
is a very OG, um, very Kush, very OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what people know is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I have a, one of the guys,
that was in Lumpa hates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is one of my better
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, but yeah, like Lumpa OG is,
um, it's basically a Lumpa headband is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a really good OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a really strong,
really potent, really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody, if anybody in America was to
get like a pure Lumpa OG, uh, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately just classify it as some kind
of Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely, I mean, I'm, I supposedly
have the headband, uh, which, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he renamed it to underdog OG
cause he originally thought it was Dave
[SPEAKER_00]: Racker, Lumpa, Lumpa, the old man who,
who ran the company for a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: he would make different names for
different brokers and different customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to some people, it would be the
underdog OG to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be Lumpa headband to other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what makes it confusing is that
people like to name things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes their life easier for sale?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the same thing happens in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, when I used to go in
Amsterdam, you'd go from one coffee shop
[SPEAKER_03]: to another and they all had the amnesia
haze, but it was labeled something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was, it was funny story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to integrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got texts of, you know, some
friends, not me, you know, they got,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they imported wheat also from
Netherlands, you know, and on the packs,
[SPEAKER_05]: normally it was written.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the early days, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really the first conks that we
saw.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a certain place in Slovenia where
they had this import at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the connection somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They imported a lot of wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the packs was written NL and all of
us, everybody was thinking it's
[SPEAKER_05]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Netherlands, but not after
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We came to the idea that that was Northern
lights, actually, you know, we don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: which one, but it was Northern lights,
most potent shit in that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want you to talk about that
Shiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Shiva skunk or Shiva Shanti or just
Shiva?
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it Shiva skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know, after the podcast that
we had, you know, came to me and he
[SPEAKER_05]: brought the old catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were looking through it and it's the
Shiva skunk picture looks like this plant
[SPEAKER_05]: when it's finished.
Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's like, like, wow, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one actually, you know,
which is like so similar that I was I was
[SPEAKER_05]: bluffed, you know, I was like,
no way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Shiva skunk sensei renamed it when
Neville sold it under his brand and his
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Big Skunk and it was Big Bud
by Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since he since he didn't really
want people to realize that they just
[SPEAKER_00]: bought Neville's company and just sold all
his same seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they changed not all, but most of the
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Big Skunk became Shiva Skunk and
L5, L5 by Skunk One became Shiva Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And L2 became Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just kept they kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was weird about it, though,
is that the drunkards were lazy and they
[SPEAKER_00]: kept this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they kept the same pictures
from Neville's earlier catalogs and they
[SPEAKER_00]: even kept some of the same verbiage in the
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just made it shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a do you still have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a nice Shiva?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about it for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God, you know, I did before in the
other podcast, but I will tell you the
[SPEAKER_05]: story again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe now because it's the same story,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they called Lucky in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a legend in the sense of hardcore
punk scene here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he was a guy that didn't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even one one guy, you know, a friend of
mine told me, no, yeah, that is the gabby.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the picture of the cut yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I how it looks now in this moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It in 97 from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Lucky was one guy that never stopped
partying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he studied and not he studied 10 years
before me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was end of the 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a roommate of a guy that of weed in
Yugoslavia times and that weed dealer quit
[SPEAKER_05]: dealing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he got access to his customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started to deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was also because he was so crazy
after the war, you know, in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_05]: we were open for traveling so he could go
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he traveled and he went to,
of course, to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in 93, 94, he was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, 95 or 97, he went
again, you know, he went many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in 97, he brought this cut back home
and he was like, he tell us like a guy
[SPEAKER_05]: that I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: He told him also that he had a cop in his
jacket with water prepared and he cut from
[SPEAKER_05]: that plant and he stole it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you know, he stole it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He nicked few that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can realize that not
many people understand that if you cut a
[SPEAKER_05]: branch of a plant and stick it in a cup
with water, you can actually for two,
[SPEAKER_05]: three days, you can drive around with it
and you can still route it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went with it from Amsterdam to
Ljubljana and he had an indoor already
[SPEAKER_05]: there, you know, because he was already
growing indoors after.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he bought a judge pass to be on
the high times economy scouts.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went from coffee shop to coffee shop,
you know, to test weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But somehow maybe he got in some,
we bought it together from the scene and
[SPEAKER_05]: he was so crazy, you know, so interesting
also for those guys, because there were
[SPEAKER_05]: not so many people from Yugoslavia at that
time traveling, you know, or even Slovenia
[SPEAKER_05]: because we were a new country at that
moment, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Independent Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were in the news.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Balkan war continued in Croatia.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had really big war and Bosnia after
and Kosovo after and it was a bloody long
[SPEAKER_05]: war.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but, but the Shiva, the Shiva came
because Lucky was not only growing the
[SPEAKER_05]: Shiva, you know, he bought seeds,
you know, in that times already in the
[SPEAKER_05]: nineties, he had a really selection of
different strains from the nineties from
[SPEAKER_05]: Amsterdam and they make mother plants and
they cut from those mother plants and they
[SPEAKER_05]: repeated the product, you know,
he wanted to standardization that you have
[SPEAKER_05]: all the time the same product for the
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was not really breathing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just taking the seed,
making them a mom from the selection,
[SPEAKER_05]: cloning it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than, rather than growing a bunch
of seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would pick a phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would pick a phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then make a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would have a consistent crop that would
all be the same looking thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the story is that there was skunk
number one, which was there with also with
[SPEAKER_05]: him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a number 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: One was very piney.
[SPEAKER_05]: The number 16 was absolutely fucking
piney, you know, like the pineyest plant
[SPEAKER_05]: ever that I smoked in my life in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the number 11 was sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, wow, it looks like a
sativa, but it flowered like an indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had almost no leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it has lived very thin,
you know, like a like a sativa ish,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he has indica flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very interesting plant, you know,
you know, for some other plants that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have in the shops at that time in the
early 2000s, you know, I will ask me not
[SPEAKER_05]: so before was sensi star from Paradise
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one, man, is a legend in Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also a legend in Slovenia because a
lot of people grow for Rick Simpson oil
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they start to grow, everybody knew
that this plant, this material,
[SPEAKER_05]: the biomass will give you two times more
oil than the normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so it was so potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it still exist there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if I were to say no now,
there will be I hope no, it does not
[SPEAKER_05]: exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now somebody should write in the comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we still have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we still have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some says it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the last time I got it, you know,
it's not in condition that I would say
[SPEAKER_05]: that it was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know about the whole Platanus
virus at that time or something,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, but I realized because I grew it
so long time, you know, and many others
[SPEAKER_05]: did a long time years for the same cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you, you know, when we talk about the
master of the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: of growing, you know, maybe master of
growing of a particular phenotype,
[SPEAKER_05]: a cut that you have for many years,
that can be you can not even be a master.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have, you know, a really good
recipe for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get close.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get close to the to the ideal
situation that you can do the best end
[SPEAKER_05]: product is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have like my own funny analogy
on it, where I feel like each strain I
[SPEAKER_00]: have is like a this might sound weird,
but like is like a girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like this living female and I
need to figure out a way to make it happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you can't treat sometimes you
have you have something and you treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You treat this new thing the way you
treated the old thing that made the old
[SPEAKER_00]: thing really happy and the new one isn't
as happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really do feel like when you grow
different clones, you have to build
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to figure out like how they like
to be fed, how they like to be grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much light they like to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really have to get to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what you're talking about,
like to get the kind of phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: expression you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you have to know how to
treat her in order to get her to express
[SPEAKER_00]: in the way that you're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I almost feel like with most
strains, it's like the first couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: times you grow it, you're just winging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then if you pay attention,
you start to learn things that make her
[SPEAKER_00]: happy or make her unhappy and you can sort
of adjust what you do based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very similar to like being in a
relationship with someone, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have to, you know,
if you want what you want, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out a way to keep them happy,
keep them, you know, because you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: them real upset too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and that's the only way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question for Francis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's polyamory, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyamory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I, you know, I just look at
it as, as plants, but that's the thing is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that I, I mean, obviously I'm not like
engaging in any kind of those activities
[SPEAKER_00]: with them, but it's, you know,
like cannabis love your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the love factor matters,
but it's also like, you can love something
[SPEAKER_00]: and still really screw it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and cannabis, you know,
cannabis, like they require very different
[SPEAKER_00]: things sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, you have to screw it up
because if you don't make mistakes,
[SPEAKER_05]: you never learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you have to make the first,
you have to make the mistake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mistakes are so important.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like without mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you don't do a, there is an old
saying in my country where it say,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, that are without mixed mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of times, like I worked,
I worked with Gabby at Gabby's shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we gave a ton of advice back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you hear so many of the
same mistakes over and over and over again
[SPEAKER_00]: that just like life, probably half of
growing is just avoiding any way you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up or you've seen other people fuck
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of life is just avoiding screw
ups, you know, by what you've seen and
[SPEAKER_00]: learned and you see some screw up and
you're like, Oh man, I never want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the diagnostic must be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you have to know what you did
wrong in the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you see something wrong, you have to
analyze it and they say, Oh, that why not
[SPEAKER_05]: that you fucked up and then you don't know
why and you make the same mistake again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not how you, how you do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to figure out a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But normally it's like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are quite focused on the thing that
you do, I mean, I mean you up,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you meet someone, like let's say,
let's say you and I were talking and you
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a strain, like say the Shiva.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've had a long relationship
with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell me a lot about what she
likes and don't like and how to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big to get her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does she like to be topped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does she not?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different little things that
might take me multiple years of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: her to slowly figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be like, Hey, I've, I've grown
this strain a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I've learned about things she
likes and dislikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that person has like a huge head
start because they don't have to observe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can just occasionally make her
happy, make her upset, figure out why they
[SPEAKER_00]: can just learn from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a clear example of that is,
is just flowering height.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what height should you flower this
plant that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if someone, if someone just
tells you that simple thing, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you flowered at this height,
it's going to get to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, you know, that was like a,
you know, because we're trying to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: it out and then we'd wait too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the plant would be like eight
feet tall and not wanting to stop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or we have this, or we have this
strain a long time ago called the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it barely grew slow as plant on earth
to grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of had to grow it to get to be
two or three or four feet tall before you
[SPEAKER_00]: flipped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you flipped it small,
it would grow like that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, and you'd be like,
Oh my God, I had this like rinky dink
[SPEAKER_00]: little thing where there's other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other strains that you could flip
them that big and they'd get, they'd grow
[SPEAKER_00]: another two or three feet and branch out
and like, and be so, I mean, I'm,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a really big proponent of that,
of like, you need to learn your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes them happy, what makes them
unhappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are there, are there any practices
that you've found where you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have to do these certain things
to make sure that I preserve some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: older genetics health, because it sounds
like some of the stuff that you have is at
[SPEAKER_01]: least like 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, doing anything special to keep
their, their health.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, two examples, we talked about
the plank and the Shiva cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the oldest cuts in my facility,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut is very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: To keep a perfect shape to, you know,
it has this, you need to, to know about
[SPEAKER_05]: trace elements and you need to renew the
mom in every three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have a really perfect cut with
this particular strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it's really hard to grow it for
six months in a small container as a mom,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I do normally with other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until six months, we can keep them in 11
liter container with for production of
[SPEAKER_05]: clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, we are feeding Kana nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kana nutrients is, you know, I've been,
we do, we did a lot of different nutrients
[SPEAKER_05]: in the past, a lot of brand you could
imagine, you know, try it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is the, like we say,
organic products, products that are
[SPEAKER_05]: certified that are not using animal
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, you know, fermented additional
matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the best one of your country is
dragonfly earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, countries there is
others, but we don't have a so specific
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis, you know, some nutrients
from my guys from Slovenia, there's young
[SPEAKER_05]: guys, you know, they still development in
development, but they are successful and
[SPEAKER_05]: good material.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good what they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in my facility, I cannot use those
products in that sense, because it's a,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, organic product in actual
container under artificial light,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, facial environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is, who is, uh, you know, uh,
with himself here, you know, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, like what's the purpose of going to
purpose is to grow outside with those
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really good for growing outside and
in greenhouses, you know, when you put it
[SPEAKER_05]: in soil, it's really good, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kana nutrients, for example, have been
there since I've been a young,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Holland?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a class, uh, miss Dieter
Klassen Klassen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So traveling around, you know,
Europe all, and I mean, it's a big company
[SPEAKER_05]: today, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Kana.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really huge company that,
uh, in lines of different uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: for, uh, uh, uh, for, uh, aquaponics for
hydroponics, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The science behind it, it's all there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did this totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Austria, they are really strong
also.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're supportive also.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we use now because also of the trace
elements, because the thing is when you
[SPEAKER_05]: grow for a long time in closed containers,
plastic containers and feed, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, time with, uh, you know, with
nitrogen, phosphor, and callium.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, iron, zinc, sulfur, mangan,
molybdenum, uh, other trace elements start
[SPEAKER_05]: to hear your moms, uh, start to die.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to feed those trace elements
to be aware about the water.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lock here because we have really
good quality of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: All Slovenia and also of part of Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Austria is also really good water is
drinkable from the tap.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plants like to drink it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where you live, but the water is
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: My facility, you know, it's, it sounds a
little bit primitive, but we grow it on
[SPEAKER_05]: soil on light mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use light mix and we are the masters of
the recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a peat based formula,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is formula also containing perlite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, you know, Connor has its own,
uh, you know, if you want to go pro,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can go, you know, if you want,
you can, you know, but it's all there
[SPEAKER_05]: still, you know, you have, I will not name
all brands now, but you know, Connor for
[SPEAKER_05]: me is one of those brands that is stable
and they know, uh, they sell those few
[SPEAKER_05]: products that they have in line.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 bottles of one line of one,
you know, how can I sell this to a
[SPEAKER_05]: customer?
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to sell it also to people also to
explain to them why some certain stuff is
[SPEAKER_05]: good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why the, I use the, we call it
in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use the bio Kana like the organic?
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to use bio Kana, but now I use a
Kana Tera and Kana Aqua for the,
[SPEAKER_05]: when the mom, when the mom gets older,
I Kana Aqua.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mom is young and you built up the mom
Kana, uh, Kana line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So me and, uh, not so dog, we used to sell
the Kana line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're one of the, I think it was first
seven stores in the U S so we're familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that Kana Tera is designed for
use in a fortified soil because they,
[SPEAKER_03]: they sold Kana Tera soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I'm experimenting right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, you know, I have Kana soil a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought now to see if it's, you know,
you have to try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also, I always tell to people that you
need to try certain things out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also not, I'm not a God.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot know if it's good or not until I
tried it and I tested it and then I see
[SPEAKER_05]: the results and you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried it on my mom's here, you know,
so I'm not going to flowery stage and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything, but that's the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm not, I'm business in
Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sell clones in, you know, we produce
10,000 clones a month now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the, in the season when the,
and, uh, in May and June, we produced
[SPEAKER_05]: 20,000 clones a month because we are
retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much you're producing 10,000 and $19
in clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're producing 10,000 clones a month
and are you selling them?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have many shops, you know, I supply a
lot of shops in Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of, there is a lot of shops and most
of these people, for example, I live on a
[SPEAKER_05]: very rural area and the square meter that
I pay for the facility that I rent is very
[SPEAKER_05]: low cost for me, you know, not,
it's not low cost, but it's reasonable
[SPEAKER_05]: price.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you live in Vienna or if you live
in Salzburg or Linz or Graz on these
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger cities, the square meter is like
four times or five times more expensive
[SPEAKER_05]: than for me to produce the clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you have, if it's not your,
uh, if you don't own the place,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to pay rent and the rent will
kill you with, uh, with, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: with electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need helpers, you know, people who,
you know, you cannot have only friends
[SPEAKER_05]: that come to your place and they will help
you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the employees, this is a legal
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the government wants to have taxes from
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they are having.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: People buy CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot of CBD production also,
you know, there's a lot of CBD plants for
[SPEAKER_05]: Austrian market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, two years ago, our, our company
produced almost 80,000, 80,000 CBD plants
[SPEAKER_05]: there and CBD, CBD, CBD in a very big
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so, but we have the smaller facility
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is our library from that library.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have this CBD strain that we produce in
80,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have now like three moms, you know,
because the month is not there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot of other strains coming,
but this particular strain is very good
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's a stabilized producing a
product for, for example, we sell to
[SPEAKER_05]: Croatia to a certain farmer that produces
CBD and CBG high, you know, it's like 12%
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he produces it in Dalmatia,
in Dalmatia coast, near Dubrovnik.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy has also one of the best
restaurants around Dubrovnik.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, he's like, wow, you know,
and this guy also, everything he puts on
[SPEAKER_05]: the table is a quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he wants clones for production of his
CBD and CBG oils, which we also produce
[SPEAKER_05]: for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like places where we can export
to Croatia, but not THC clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not, he has a permit for CBD and
CBG clones that we can produce for him and
[SPEAKER_05]: that we produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're, we sell them to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also it's like, you know, as I said in
a lot of postcards, I have a European
[SPEAKER_05]: passport for the plants, but I can sell to
companies that have the permit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or to Germany to a home grower now from
April.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is really, really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, it's going here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like opening up now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's like, it's starting,
you know, this is 10 years ready,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like your orders go from like
anywhere from one to two plants all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way up to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, plant to plant, of course.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mothers and grandfathers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can not talk about it flowering when
people come to me in the, in the shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And normally people understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just say, which one is best?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they, they asking for plants,
but I'm not the one who will tell anything
[SPEAKER_05]: that would be illegal for them to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You understand one time, you know,
I assume that it was, uh, they were police
[SPEAKER_05]: and they came into the shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing what they were asking me
of something for smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was never a customer in the last six
years that would ask me that he could get
[SPEAKER_05]: something to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, you know, and then this lady went to
this, to this plant and she asked,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, when I flower this, I want to
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was so obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really like pissing against the
wind and smelling a policeman,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like, like, you know,
if you see the police call a brother,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, but you will not fool me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I have a very good relation
to the police.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, because we don't, we don't do
anything illegal now, but that was time,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they come to check you,
which is actually legit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they come to check if you're
selling drugs, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom, uh, is a cancer patient survivor
and she cured her, uh, three times having
[SPEAKER_05]: cancer on her womb and on her left breast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after a few years of her right
breast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last time when she had breast
cancer, she said she will not take any
[SPEAKER_05]: chemotherapy, any, any, whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we made Rick Simpson oil for her and
she's still alive today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 15 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: She still takes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, she still takes the oil and
people know her about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody says she's Rambo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like she's like a Rambo, you know,
John Rambo, you know, my mom, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yeah, that's what she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's Rambo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the cops coming in is cops
going into like, like I said, that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could only buy water pipes in head shops
back in the day when it was still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cops would come in undercover
and they would be like, I want to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best one that's going to give
me the best hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what if they would try to trip people
up and get them talking about it so they
[SPEAKER_00]: could get them to admit that it was for
like a purpose that then the cop could be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, you're not, that's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's two things I want to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first a quick story in New York city,
you could ask for a bong at the smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved to California and I went to this
head shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the mighty Quinn in Santa
Rosa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And first thing I do when I arrive,
I go to the head shop and I asked the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: for a bong and he literally freaks out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He like freaks out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I mean, I just didn't know,
you know, there was something saying these
[SPEAKER_03]: are water pipes, but I've called it a
bong, you know, so far all my life,
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the guy freaks out and you know,
then I learned the program and I just say
[SPEAKER_03]: water pipe, but then I see him at every
single Grateful Dead show that I've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: been to in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, I mean, man, this is over 30
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still go to the same place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same smoke shop and the same guy,
he doesn't own a place.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like one of the main workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He still worked there till just recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would tell all the staff that works
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this guy, he used to freak out on me
if I come in here and ask for a bong
[SPEAKER_03]: because now they don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's like, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back then, and they all, you know,
they all laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is it was the same thing
at the grow stores because after Operation
[SPEAKER_03]: Green Merchant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you went to a grow store,
back in the day, you definitely didn't say
[SPEAKER_03]: you were growing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people would say, yeah,
I want to grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, you would, you know,
you would, you would, they would,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the grow stores would sell seeds,
like flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, like I'm talking like,
like, yeah, like not, but I just mean like
[SPEAKER_00]: you would often buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would recommend that you buy some
flower seeds or some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brussels sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some this or some that or whatever,
because you had to have a purpose for why
[SPEAKER_00]: you were growing this, growing this,
you know, buying this grow equipment or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even then, like when I,
when I first started growing, we hired a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend who was totally safe and was down
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would drive us to the store in
their car because the cops would record
[SPEAKER_00]: your license plate to figure out who you
were sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to like, you had to have
someone else bring you there because if
[SPEAKER_00]: they would write your license plate down,
they could find where the grow was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it was sketch in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of had to, you know, at the first
Gabby knows what I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was this store called the Brew
and Grow in the Midwest and they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a robust amount of, you know,
actual flower, you know, like lilies and
[SPEAKER_00]: this and that like tons of different
flower seeds and tons of different like
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs and, and, and vegetables and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would always buy packs of seeds
with your purchase because you needed a
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, Oh, what are you going to
grow this with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so you spend whatever five or 10
bucks extra on some random packs of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you had like a reason to buy the
grow light and the table, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for your.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many pounds of cherry tomatoes do you
think I can grow under this?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these places, you know,
a lot of growth stores, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information they had was rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could get hassled and there was this
cat and mouse game of like the owner would
[SPEAKER_00]: try to tell the buyer as much as he could
without getting entrapped or in trouble,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because people didn't know what
they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would come in and they'd be
like, I want to grow, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it all goes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the system, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, there wasn't internet
or anything like that, or it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: young still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even just figuring out the basics
for a lot of people was new.
[SPEAKER_03]: When, when you and I were working at the
garden spout, that's exactly what was
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: People were coming in and saying,
I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like back then we were able to
actually give people, I'll tell a funny
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very brief, but because
Gabby and I, like when you worked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth store, it was kind of like,
in a way it was sort of like Gabby owned a
[SPEAKER_00]: porn shop or something like that,
where it was like, I'm dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you would see people,
you would see people in the grocery store
[SPEAKER_00]: that absolutely would not want the public
to know that they shopped with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would give you fake names or
nicknames because they didn't want the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth store to know their real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes you're in this little ass
town in Mendo and you're like rolling down
[SPEAKER_00]: the aisle of the grocery store and you
want to say hey to somebody and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: with their buddies or their family and
they do not want those people to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they shop with you or even where they know
you from, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might just know their nickname or
whatever name they decided to give you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might not be at all their real name
or what other people call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on occasion, there would be some
awkward, unintentionally awkward stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because people did not want to get in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want their family to know what
they were doing maybe, or their friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe they had a regular job that it
wasn't cool to do what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we knew about their secret life and
they did not want everyone to know about
[SPEAKER_00]: their secret life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Brother, there is still one customer that
comes to my place.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's from Hungary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hungary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he comes over the border from Hungary
and he never buys clothes, but he always
[SPEAKER_05]: buys seats, you know, at my shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a mask all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know his eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen his face ever because he
started to come to my place when there was
[SPEAKER_05]: coronavirus epidemic, you know,
pandemic, you know, everything was closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when he came first time, he already had
the mask.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he kept this mask.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, you know, he's by, he's never
bought plants, but he buying seats,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he's still keeping the mask when he
comes to our shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even today, when there is no more
resistance or nothing, because,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like, you know, but this guy is
like, so for him is like, when he comes,
[SPEAKER_05]: he wants to finish it in five minutes,
you know, like what you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want, actually I want something for you,
but I want to get out of here as soon as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is like, you know, his mask on when
he drives away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With a mask in the car by himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's still here like this,
but it's, you know, Hungary is a different
[SPEAKER_05]: place for cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really strict, very strict.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even we are in the European union,
but Slovenia will legalize soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Germany has already legalized and
other, other countries will follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there is Luxembourg that only they
all grow for a few years now and Malta
[SPEAKER_05]: that can grow for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spain has so many, I mean, Spain is not
legal, but it's, it was always in Spain
[SPEAKER_05]: like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I traveled with bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the story from maybe before we
want to tell you bubble bags for the ice
[SPEAKER_05]: water hush.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I traveled with this in Andalusia,
which is the place where normally the
[SPEAKER_05]: Moroccan hash comes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's very neat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, Morocco.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these guys have a really old hash
culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not, they, at that time,
they were not used to smoke flowers so
[SPEAKER_05]: much because I know, you know,
we had some flower and they were like,
[SPEAKER_05]: wow, somebody has flower, you know,
like we will smoke marijuana, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, and that is like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the hash, what they got, of course,
is for all from Morocco, but I have these
[SPEAKER_05]: bags and I told them what I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one guy of those guys had a,
because in Spain, even today, I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: and in this time also, you have this law,
you cannot go inside in somebody's house
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's his privacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have this Hacienda, you know,
which is like an inner garden always from
[SPEAKER_05]: outside, always walls.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you enter in Spain, a traditional
house for in the south of Spain,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Andalusia, you will always see,
you know, a garden inside and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, normally it's a garden for
shadow and people can have a rest there
[SPEAKER_05]: and their own privacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, these guys were growing
cannabis as much as you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like even today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have clones which they put out
and they start to flower first because
[SPEAKER_05]: they were putting them out too early in
the season.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the light was too, you know,
so they start to flower, but then they
[SPEAKER_05]: re-vegetate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, re-vegetation, they made these
strange mutations, la, la, la.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after three weeks, they start to put
out the vegetative state again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they came and I said to
them, cut all of these undeveloped,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, fresh buds that are there,
cut it from the plant because they will
[SPEAKER_05]: have, you know, also for the plant is good
to do that, you know, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cut the nails, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So she can, yeah, so she can perform like
she should.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a lot of this biomaterial
with a lot of crystals on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in July, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we made ice water hash for them there
in Malaga.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, you know, those people were
traditional in hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their father and their grandfather already
smoked hash, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how integrated they are,
hash smokers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the culture for hash is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I make the bubble hash and I saw
it and I tried it, they said it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: zero, zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it zero, zero quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like the hash that you would
normally get.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot get it because Moroccans
normally don't import zero, zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is for the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grades keep going down the farther
away from the farm it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's commercial stuff that's made and
there's the high grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: So bubble hash, of course, didn't have
this aroma.
[SPEAKER_05]: That they were used to normally from the
dry sift pollination of hash
[SPEAKER_05]: traditionally, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They beat it, you know, in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not gravity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It falls.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like a different flavor,
but it was so strong for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say it is like, man, it is,
and I show them the bags and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course that was like bubble man,
you know, and Mila, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: before him, that, you know, with the
extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: But bubble man had so many different
grades of the silks, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: different screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many, you know, Moroccan hash typically
made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, where you were traveling,
you know, in Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hash hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moroccan pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can break it with your,
it's like very brownie and you can break
[SPEAKER_05]: it apart very easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like cacao, you know, like you have,
you know, like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, and it's very tasty and it's
not strong, the pollen, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pollen is really like the day smoke,
but then the really black that they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that time, you know, like there was
like, I was a street musician with a
[SPEAKER_05]: friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were traveling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing didgeridoo and he was
playing drums on the streets with me and
[SPEAKER_05]: we were earning money like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, to survive on the streets,
you know, just to travel, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: not even not having a bad time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We having, we are a tourist, but we were
tourists on that kind of that we are
[SPEAKER_05]: connecting to the street people there,
you know, we have in our own show with
[SPEAKER_05]: music and we're connect with the locals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were guys from South America,
some Colombian girls from, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful girls, you know, like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a really good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spend a really good time in Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this was months, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I returned home to my studies
again, you know, it was, it was like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the, the, the thing I saw there,
you know, because in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_05]: when I come there, me and my friend get
some hash and we were like trying to roll
[SPEAKER_05]: a joint on the, but you know, somewhere in
the sea, we eat something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we old guy came, you know,
old fisherman and his, his motorbike and
[SPEAKER_05]: he came and he were like hiding first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody came and that guy was like more
than 60 years old, you know, like hiding
[SPEAKER_05]: our joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and then we saw that he eat
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, he started to make a
joint in his hand because Spanish people,
[SPEAKER_05]: they always make joints in the hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make the hashish and they rub it into
the tobacco or they rub it into the
[SPEAKER_05]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they, how, how they, they smoke hashish
with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is Europeans do that, you know,
but they really rub the hash into the day,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, like massaging it into it,
you know, and this 60 year old guy made a
[SPEAKER_05]: hash joint there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In front of us and you were like watching
each other, like, are we fucking idiots?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like if this guy is smoking like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, we, we saw that guys
are smoking joints in the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: The police walks by.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's watch this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in that time today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course we have the social clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have everywhere around Spain and the
Canary Islands and everywhere you have the
[SPEAKER_05]: social clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of wheat has been bred there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of seed companies that you
think that they are in-house production.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's from Spain, from closets,
from houses, from, I don't know what kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of places, you know, maybe I won't tell
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I assume that it's like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I assume because of so
many years of experience, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is, for example, seed,
banks that pop up, you know, every day
[SPEAKER_05]: here that is like just having a few
strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know, just like we popped up,
we have like five strains and nobody even
[SPEAKER_05]: heard about them ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is some random peaks, you know,
some, you see that it's white label
[SPEAKER_05]: actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you ask them, is it white label?
[SPEAKER_05]: Seed banks come to your shop and he tried
to sell to your shop that you would resell
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So normally I ask those kinds of seed
banks, do you, white label, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: normally they say it's not white label,
but we buy from friends from Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's white label.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbie's is centered in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard of herbies before?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it is attitude, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Attitude seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because genetics from original sensible
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Original sensible seeds.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all white label though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they had a bunch of stuff like I,
I got their Bruce Banner, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as we know, Bruce Banner is
actually from Dark Horse and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually still have the plant to
this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a phenomenal plant,
but it wasn't, you know, exactly,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it wasn't the Bruce Banner
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just their combination of the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything that I've grown from,
you know, what I've got from Spanish
[SPEAKER_02]: companies were, it were all excellent
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys know Gene's proof?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know him very well, but I know who
he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, I got a link, you know,
some people asked me already for some of
[SPEAKER_05]: his trends here, but in some time,
a Spanish resellers, you could get his
[SPEAKER_05]: gear, but now it's almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the same thing for DJ short
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could get them at a certain point of
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The old world genetics that he has now or
DJ short label that he has cannot get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from American genetics,
what we can get here, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: from the, from it is few seed banks,
but mostly it is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we look to America and you look to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want our strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want your strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it is a very funny situation
actually, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want your clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want mine clones actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I would like to try them
because it's so different from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I know, you know, I was talking with
Gabby about the Amnesia Corkut,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it is all around Austria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost every second shop has this cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all common here Amnesia, the super
silver Hayes cut, you know, we feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way like with Canada because
obviously there's a border and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of communication now
between Canada and America with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting and all the forums and IG and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a bunch of stuff up
there that people are interested in and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that's down here that they're
interested in that borders just make it
[SPEAKER_00]: tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis isn't free,
you know, it's not, it's not free moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has issues and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's pockets where, yeah,
you look over and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what do these people have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's survived?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, and then all that
stuff to me is like with all the changes
[SPEAKER_00]: and legalization, like it's still hard to
hold on to stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reasons why, because right now it's
like an, I would say in California or
[SPEAKER_00]: America in general, there's this phrase
purple candy gas, which is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want purple weed that smells kind of
candy ish, but has some gassy OG notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of dominates everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's people are people get,
it's tough to, there isn't like a
[SPEAKER_00]: repository yet where people can just like
store old strains and come back to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, you, every time there's a
huge like wave of popularity and
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you risk a lot of other
diversity, just being lost, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's easy to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to grow what brokers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to grow what the market wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you know what else
happened, Francis, when, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: Byroyd came around, a lot of people got
rid of their genetics and didn't attempt
[SPEAKER_03]: to save it, you know, using Maristem.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, Oh, this plant's sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder how many genetics we lost
that way of just like, In the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community, Hop Layton was like our AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that people realized it was a
problem, it was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people saw things, plants getting sick
and issues happening, but they didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what was causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what the transmission was
like, so how to stop it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But can you, can you tell me that it was
the damping effect?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just see how a wildfire goes
through a facility with a damping.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like that because I never thought
that, you know, for me, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we test, but for us,
we are lucky on this moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we are trying to prepare for what is
coming, you know, like, you know what I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back when Gabby and I first became
friends, you would just take a razor blade
[SPEAKER_00]: or a pair of scissors and you would just
cut off whatever plant you wanted until
[SPEAKER_00]: the razor got dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never considered anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I would say once, now that we've
learned how Hop Layton works, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit like getting a tattoo where
like each plant needs a fresh blade or a
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized blade or scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's various techniques
you can do, but that wasn't the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when it was starting to spread,
people were just taking the same dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors or the same dirty razor and
cutting dozens of different plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: plugging them and not realizing that they
were spreading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what really messed us up is that
people started buying clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just like growing their own
moms in their own houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once it got into a nursery,
that nursery might sell it to thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: customers for years before they even
realized they had a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're taking steps to make it
not that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it was spreading the first four
or five years, it was percolating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was taking any steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like black cart nursery out of
Harbor Side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark cart nursery and then selling out of
Harbor Side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the epidemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're like, I'm going to make
sure for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back again, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids are calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the plants got sick before they
knew it was Hop Layton, they might have
[SPEAKER_03]: thrown it away because the plant was just
growing shitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after when they knew it was Hop
Layton, a lot of people destroyed plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were just going to go move on
to something else that wasn't sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how a lot of genetics were lost,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today that we know that we could have
saved them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have saved them with Meristem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, actually, you know that you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you do Meristem extraction,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you do it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, and it's all because of HLVD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier this year, I was informed about
this clone company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And initially we thought it was OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I placed a big order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got the order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, after talking with the
community and people recommending I test
[SPEAKER_02]: it, I said, you know, let's just take a
step further.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get it tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, four out of the 12,
you know, were positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm sitting there freaking out
like, oh, I just spent a grand on these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and now I got to throw them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I had it quarantined the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw out those four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I waited another two weeks and I retested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another four popped positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, you know, shit,
like this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all my hard work after these years of
phenol hunting and selecting these strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wanted to work with, you know,
they're all in jeopardy because I have
[SPEAKER_02]: these, you know, these sick plants in,
you know, inside my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're quarantined in their
own separate tent and everything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I ended up throwing all those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it really didn't sit well with me,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of started me on my path of
learning about, you know, how can you save
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant that's infected with, you know,
a disease, you know, because as we know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not just HLVD, but it could be,
you know, Fusarium or any of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal infections and everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the positive thing is one day
we're going to get to a point where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to trade a lot more
freely, maybe among states and countries
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that with a lot less risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside of that is that we're going
to definitely end up having that continue
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's going to be way more risk of
pathogens, fungal diseases, viroids
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading around, which may be localized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're just going to end up all
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like hop latent, there could be
something right now percolating around
[SPEAKER_00]: that people don't know about and is
unidentified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like hop latent is the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at it, I treat like I have a
bunch of moms and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat my moms like I'm a tattoo artist,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where every single plant gets its own
sterilized scissors or razor or gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to take all these different steps to
like prevent transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I don't have it,
I think, I assume I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's how you have to treat your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume like I do, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, it just is,
it's crappy because, yeah, I can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glory because of how wet it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need to actually kind of attend to
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have several different samples in there
that I'm going to be kind of taking out
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, putting it into their own
containers and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one I started probably about the
end of August and it was all from Mary
[SPEAKER_02]: Stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you show people what a fresh Mary Stem
looks like so they can see how much that's
[SPEAKER_03]: grown?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a, it's like a sliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a speck of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not so dogged.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, most people, most people look at
it and go, that's just a little plant
[SPEAKER_03]: growing in there, but they don't realize
that came from virtually nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like she has to do these
cuttings under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's one from the seventh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little dirty here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just right there.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tiny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what almost 20 days,
you know, so tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to use a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in front of a laminar flow hood,
you know, to make sure it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as sterile of an environment that I can
work in, because, you know, as far as the
[SPEAKER_02]: media that you're using in here,
if there's any specs of anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll take off, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have a sterile area of
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for micro propagation, you know,
as Gabby says, he's talked about before,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you work with essentially a
still air box, and it's not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a perfect still air box because you don't
have like the gloves in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that you could do the
same with Mary's stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mary's stem definitely would
require a flow hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the contact time alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working with it for longer than a
smaller cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely quicker at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can extract a Mary's stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd say anywhere from five to 10
minutes, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's still a long time if you're not
sitting there in front of the flow hood.
[SPEAKER_05]: But actually, it's great that it's coming
this age where home growers will also do
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary's stem extraction or nodule maybe at
home.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That we have a possibility that,
you know, there are systems out there that
[SPEAKER_05]: allow you to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these small, you know,
one came out from this guy, from American
[SPEAKER_05]: guy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Will Graham, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's crazy, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have photos and I'm going to share them
in this video of tissue culture that I did
[SPEAKER_03]: with his kit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the one thing about nodal
tissue culture is while it may not remove
[SPEAKER_03]: virus, you have clean clones of like
mildew and bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like if, you know, everyone that
shared a plant with me throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: years had given me a plant grown even with
nodal tissue culture, that would have
[SPEAKER_03]: saved me a lot of headaches from,
I mean, got spider mites countless times
[SPEAKER_00]: from people sharing plants with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pluses and minuses with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely think it has its uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd say another huge one,
especially from all of us, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiasts who love every single strain
we come across or, you know, just about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that I've had this in a dish
and then, you know, now in this container
[SPEAKER_02]: for what were we looking at, like three
months or so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to keep your genetics on a shelf
without having to worry
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually you do your own agar,
you mix your own agars for the purpose,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether you let it grow or you let it
root, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he doesn't put hormones.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not he's not put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, one thing that, you know,
like is not so, you know, he has concerns
[SPEAKER_03]: about it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he told in one podcast, I wanted to
ask him about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you have concerns if you knew
he's not using hormones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those plants are basically growing in
water and sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so like, I think that kind of
addresses your concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, I have to deal with this today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But look at all the roots coming out of
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's no hormones in that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is going to be quite sure for
me to untangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, there's like barely even any
green growth at the top, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like hard to see down on the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just look at all that we can actually
see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, no hormones at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the plant doing what it does
with the hormones already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like everything you mentioned about like
storing genetics and having them grow
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having them be healthy and having them
not take as much space up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say my experience has been I think
Maristem is it's obviously expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: time consuming for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it cleans up like pesticides or
herbicides or, you know, different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that might have been like sprayed on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem to me, sadly, that
Maristem solves the hop latent issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or at least I've heard plenty of
failure, you know, like when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: like thinking that that was going to be
the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have I do think like with any I
don't want to say it's new technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like new to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a farm in Santa Barbara where
we got about 80,000 tissue culture clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had been treated with some kind
of hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we grew them all out,
we planted them in our beds and we grew
[SPEAKER_00]: out acres of them and they all threw male
balls like multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm talking I had the head guy won't
say the company name because that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had the head grower visit the farm
and he was like, I want to see how bad
[SPEAKER_00]: this male problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he walks up and there's like 40 or
40 like the workforce down there is all
[SPEAKER_00]: Hispanic or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dozens of people picking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male flowers and he walks up and I'm like,
you want to see how many there are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look down and he looks down and we had
like two or three five gallon buckets full
[SPEAKER_00]: of male flowers that they'd already picked
before he got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that many it really and then,
as you guys know, when a plant gets like
[SPEAKER_00]: when a seeded, it doesn't matter if it got
lightly seeded or heavily seeded,
[SPEAKER_00]: it stops growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower the way that it should,
and it focuses on finishing the seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: is like finishing what's been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of like getting these big
robust plants about two and a half or
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks in, it all got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got dink, dink, dink, dink,
dink, dink of these nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically just they messed up
on on their hormones, on their levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: on their agar, whatever they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was to the point where they
basically I think ended up going out of
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was crazy because it was a big
enough farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were running about 38 or 40 different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All 12 things from them did the same thing
and nothing from anyone else did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so it was just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's up to selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's also addressed by cosmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I just mean, well, I just meant
more like there's a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I almost think in a way and
maybe I'm wrong, but I also got like I
[SPEAKER_00]: have some photos on my phone of like
getting a hundred plants at a time from a
[SPEAKER_00]: different company that was doing tissue
culture that didn't give us any issues at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, except for the clones were literally
like this big in these tiny little rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: like plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had to make in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to make like little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you rip open the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you pictures, Gabby,
of like there were these like a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and fit into a tray like that big,
you know, and I know they grew fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you needed to baby the heck out of
them for the first week to 10 days to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them because it's such a small amount of
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those clones took an extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took a while to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it literally took it took one month
till they look like a clone that you would
[SPEAKER_03]: normally have freshly rooted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, which is from a nursery,
they were tiny, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for me, like at least so far from
what I've seen, I think cleaning up plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and trading plants amongst friends using
tissue culture or going through Maristem
[SPEAKER_00]: is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was doing something production
oriented, I would want to grow that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a normal fashion, once it's been
cleaned up and get a big, big,
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous mom and start taking tons of
clones off it the way I normally do,
[SPEAKER_00]: because then I can start with a clone
that's like this big if I want,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can leave extra leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to root and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not so I'm not saying it's a
negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like it requires its
own like application to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like the application that
companies like Jungle Boys use it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not doing actual micro
propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more just genetic preservation and
then pulling out clean mothers and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually vetting them out, producing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the last 10% of your production,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, I'm this library.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me, because I met Mike from Jungle Boys,
Mike Hydro in Barcelona, two years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were speaking about this and he asked
me because I like how he approached me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said to me, you know, if it's the last
10% in your facility, then it's something
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's okay for you, you know,
the flow, the laminar flow hood,
[SPEAKER_05]: the starter kit that they have,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're not having your,
you know, your, your SOPs already,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if you're having dealing with
that and still not developed your company
[SPEAKER_05]: until that time, that moment, it's no use
for you because, you know, he sells you a
[SPEAKER_05]: product, but then he sells you,
you must be on 90% now if you want to buy
[SPEAKER_05]: this because otherwise it will not have a
use for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that is true actually,
because if you don't know how to grow good
[SPEAKER_05]: moms with healthy, healthiness,
you know, in a basis, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: about growing tables or any kind of
forest, that means that you have to learn
[SPEAKER_05]: something before that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can go to tissue culture,
not before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I compare also totally under canopy
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't want to use under canopy
lighting unless you already have
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else dialed in and you can't
get any more out of that space without
[SPEAKER_01]: adding more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it's maxing out your
production potentials, but it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not worth it if you're not already
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, tissue culture, it's, it's very
hard on the explant, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the portion that you cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your mom plants not healthy already,
you know, you're going to have a bad time
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could potentially, I mean,
we don't know if it was the hormones that
[SPEAKER_02]: they use for the tissue culture that,
you know, affected the genetics to make,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, produce a bunch of, you know,
male pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do know one, one thing that I've
read about is the potential for genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I understand, and of course
people can correct me into Collins.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is something I just briefly
read, but every plant has two sets of
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes when you do the tissue
culture process, what will happen is the
[SPEAKER_02]: second set of chromosomes will kind of
take over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant that you grow out will not,
it won't be the same plant that you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you tissue cultured from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be almost like this, you know,
kind of, you know, like, I've seen that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people that, that paid,
you know, four or five, $6,000 to have
[SPEAKER_00]: their heirloom plant Maristemmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they grew you know, what they got
back next to their old, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they had kept in their mother plants
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the new Maristem plant had more
vigor and more health, but came out
[SPEAKER_00]: different flower than they were used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a change there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always heard that called like
somoclonal variation where you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the chromosomes are actually like a
de-differentiated, I believe is what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, cause genetic drift is something
that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens within a population over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't get genetic drift within a
single cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get genetic drift just with cloning as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thinks it's a different term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetic drift is the wrong term,
but genetic drift is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you had like a population of wild
cannabis where it would reseed itself and
[SPEAKER_01]: reseed itself season to season,
but, and then it would adapt in that area
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be called genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, what we're experiencing within
like having a clone be different than what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's mother plant presented when in flower
would be called something called
[SPEAKER_01]: somoclonal variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hard stop that I have to do cause
I have to do something with my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hate to be, I hate to be abrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they are getting, I have to take one
of them to a practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they're off for Thanksgiving
break or whatnot, I still have some dad
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting frantically waved at that
I'm drifting into a bad time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to, guys don't have to stop
talking, but I need to bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful meeting you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we will, we will talk again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys all have a lovely day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we cannot stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the basic thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are friends who sit down on the couch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, you know, like we are, that's a
great thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like that, you know,
I mean, we've been drifting a little bit,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's always like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, the best thing about it is that
you have this, that is happening by,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, by itself, not just by yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, oh, we have a script now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some things that they didn't tell
you yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been writing down questions as
we've been talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we didn't get to like,
we'll have to continue again in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully part three, hopefully part three
real soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to say before we left,
I want to say this about the tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture is when you do Meristem,
you're not guaranteed to remove virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this is what Nasadab was saying,
but when you do Meristem and then you do
[SPEAKER_03]: it again and then you test and then you
grow things that then it's possible to
[SPEAKER_03]: remove the virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, where some people say,
well, I Meristem'd it now it's clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, you've Meristem'd it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to, and the problem with the
hoplite and viroid is because it hides so
[SPEAKER_03]: well, you have to grow it and test it for
some time before you know if, if the work
[SPEAKER_03]: actually was done, but it's definitely
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not as easy as any of us would
like it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I read, it's about a 50% chance
to be able to extract, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Meristem that is completely healthy for
your viroids if it was coming from an
[SPEAKER_02]: infected mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like you said, it's,
it's almost like a process of refinement
[SPEAKER_02]: of just doing it over and over again until
you have that end product that you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, which is a clean and healthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But can you tell me, do you know about how
it transmits over seed production also?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how, how much percent of the seeds
when you cross something that is infected,
[SPEAKER_05]: you make seeds and then you sell those
seeds as a breeder or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember, there's a great article
from, I think it's like the Mathenol
[SPEAKER_02]: Institute of Health or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an actual government article
that they did a study from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was in the high 80
percentile.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80, which is actually pretty low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's pretty low if you consider that
20% of them of the crosses won't have
[SPEAKER_03]: HLVD, you know, like you could actually
like grow that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't write.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, well, I mean, you got to grow them
out and then test them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: repeatedly, you know, plants next to
healthy plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hoplite and viroid is you know,
like how Natsudog said, it's like AIDS.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to worry about shaking
hands with somebody with AIDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that way with hoplite.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be like cross contamination
from water, you know, if you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: careful, there could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so that's why I said you did this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's things that you can do to make
sure that you're not sharing water and so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're not sharing scissors like like
a dirty needle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I believe it was a study out of
Guelph in Canada that found that it could
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer from contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like they found that like one plant
didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was next to a plant that did have it
and it had it later in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't sharing any like irrigation
streams or anything like they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to the same reservoir or
anything like that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the potential is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a study also that there is in one
plant you they measured the lot and virus
[SPEAKER_05]: and they found that in the upper part of
the plant, there was no lot and see there
[SPEAKER_05]: was no virus there present.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they couldn't measure it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the lower branches, there were
virus in other places of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The virus was moving its way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why Maristem works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because you are out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outgrowing the virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you take before the virus came to
this tissue, you you cut it away and you
[SPEAKER_05]: try to to culture it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all the banana and all the orchid
and all the everything in the world,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, food production is relying on
Maristem and culture as itself for 100
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a guy 100 years ago developed
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a very old.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about something that if
somebody 100 years ago could do that or
[SPEAKER_05]: the basics of it, how could today more
than 100 years later, we cannot do it at
[SPEAKER_05]: home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every, you know, not every grower,
home grower, but a lot of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: the ones that are dedicated with the
heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with a small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing it at home, so it's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, realistically, it's only maybe two
thousand dollars I probably put in my lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, probably a little bit more
because I got a lot more supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the microscope,
you know, it was about 700.
[SPEAKER_02]: My flow hood was 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pressure cooker was about 160,
180 somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the biggest parts of a lab
that you would need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is relatively inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get those three big parts
knocked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely build yourself a home
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, definitely hope we have Sasha on for
a part three again soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a few strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is a few strains I had on
the list.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even mention to not so because he
asked me and then I have like and then we
[SPEAKER_05]: stopped because all of these strains have
so much history.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they have a story behind that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, you know, you cannot say
like, oh, that was a strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like in one minute and a half,
I will tell you the story about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot because it has so much story.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is so many others, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope people will come up now in
Austria, you know, because other shops and
[SPEAKER_05]: librarians like me also, maybe maybe they
could give us a signal and they could join
[SPEAKER_05]: the conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or any part of the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any part of the world, not only this part
where I am, you know, but anywhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, before we go, I just want to
make sure I tell you all you guys how
[SPEAKER_03]: grateful I am for all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to continuing this
conversation soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cool to be able to, you know,
not just talk shop, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get a glimpse in everyone else's way of
growing and especially all the way across
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, how cool is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's so awesome about life and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, you know how many we know how many
people are like this in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is a we are like a ripe,
you know, this is a tribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of people of nomads of nomads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, like it's a it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That it happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's continue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabby, you will be keep me updated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask you publicly in front of
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to be our European
correspondent and I want you to talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: people that we don't know and that we
can't talk to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's in English, we obviously we
want to be a part of it, you know,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we open we open up the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't shut it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's open.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we flip the rock, you know,
like it's open like Pandora's box open.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there is, you know, yeah,
I think we'll respond and I could be
[SPEAKER_05]: actually you're one of your
correspondents, you know, as you said,
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be one of them because I'm not the
only one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is so many others that
would be maybe more talented to tell the
[SPEAKER_05]: other stories and they have their own
stories and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, you have me here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one is like we want to tell
stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to tell stories with friends on
the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, hopefully you'll help us
make some more friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I think we'll be also encouraged
by this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that somebody stepped out,
you know, and told a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_05]: story.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is going on here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's to your story, but also very
different for your first story,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, from your your your place of the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a different different the same
story with a different meant different
[SPEAKER_05]: drama, you know, all of us have all fed up
with that, that the illegal to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: economies for a little small purpose,
you know, for yourself or in a little
[SPEAKER_05]: small scale that I think the world has
enough of lies, you know.

brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_03]: Company.
