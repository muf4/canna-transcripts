[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Way We Grow podcast, a production of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Craft Growers Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Nick Wolf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today our guest is Matthew Gates.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also known as Sync Angel on
Instagram, and you can find his library of
[SPEAKER_03]: pest management information on his YouTube
channel, Zenthenol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, how have you been?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while since we talked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been happily productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often give that answer to people,
actually, when they ask me how I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really happy to hear it,
especially right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's February.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people who have seasons, unlike myself
living in Southern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: either it's still really cold and it's
about to be spring, so this is the perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: time for people to be reevaluating how
they go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened last year?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we do this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of reflection is really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you find most of your
professional efforts focused these days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do a lot of cannabis consulting
work, or are you also working with other
[SPEAKER_03]: like perennials or nursery plants or
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do work in both of those fields,
but most of my work lately has been in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, just today I was working with
somebody who was dealing with a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really execution on a strategy that
should be working, but wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a matter of drilling into the
execution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like it when you get a little
puzzle like that and you have to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out, it seems all the pieces fit,
but there's something that's not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to narrow it down to something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that all the time in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people will know you for the
approachability of your pest primer
[SPEAKER_03]: videos, as well as your other integrated
pest management resources that you have on
[SPEAKER_03]: your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do always provide a very insightful
look into pest management when you are on
[SPEAKER_03]: the panel of the Growing with My Fellow
Growers podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Way We Grow podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like to dive into people's
history with growing plants in general,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not that be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering that your professional life is
more heavily focused on the cannabis side
[SPEAKER_03]: of pest management applications,
where did you start with growing plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it something where you had houseplants
growing up or a vegetable garden with mom
[SPEAKER_03]: and dad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Take us back to when young Matthew Gates
was entering into the world of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go before my existence,
into my parentage, you've got my father
[SPEAKER_01]: who grew up in Kentucky, Zin-Zinatti,
Kentucky, as they would often refer to it
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what it used to be called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's Zin-Zinatti.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people would say that's not Kentucky,
but he would always say it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a farm background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we didn't really do any of that
with me growing up personally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is some of that influence
that maybe should be talked about a bit as
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, my enjoyment, my interests in
plant biology and would eventually become
[SPEAKER_01]: an ecological appreciation too,
is through insect life mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like to reference things like
Pokemon, giving yourself as a person born
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having a virtual world that you
can kind of play around with concepts as a
[SPEAKER_01]: child and also then reinforce those things
out in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Satoshi Tajiri, who is the creator of
Pokemon, by some regard got the idea for
[SPEAKER_01]: Pokemon for doing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to caves, going to fields,
catching bugs as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a thematic relevance
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as I grew, I enjoyed insects and
things like that because they have this
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of alien sort of physiology very
different than our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because most bugs eat plants,
that's where the avenue kind of comes into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've been benefited now like a
fungi and all other kinds of life forms is
[SPEAKER_01]: all good, all very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where it kind of started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the draw was really through the aspect
of insects and their activity around
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, not necessarily plants at first.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what directed my attention
first.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as someone else who was born in
the 90s, Pokemon was a huge part of my
[SPEAKER_03]: early childhood and still continues to
remain a part of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even to this day, I still enjoy playing
the games every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they're very nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also I see how there is like the
aspect of, you know, if you're out in the
[SPEAKER_03]: grass and you find a bug and you pick it
up and you look at it, that's pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what Pokemon or these other,
you know, animated animal games are very
[SPEAKER_03]: closely similar to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you were then growing up,
what other, you know, taking the idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: you got brought into plants through your
enjoyment or your excitement with bugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: where did that then kind of go from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, basically, I had a few different
options, you know, growing up for what I
[SPEAKER_01]: could do as a career that I was planning
on anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually I came to the conclusion
that I wanted to work in agriculture since
[SPEAKER_01]: I already had this affinity for was
essentially the enemy for so many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fortunately, because a lot of people
don't like bugs or don't like pathogens or
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of a thing, they avoid even
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was happy to take on that role
and be that limb that somebody doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, to sort of efficaciously
deal with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I think, you know, growing up,
another aspect of that strong aspect for
[SPEAKER_01]: me, at least was like with cannabis,
for example, I had friends growing and I
[SPEAKER_01]: had friends who would ask me questions
because, you know, the guy who knows those
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a happy synergy there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially because a lot of times
people get what are by most regards,
[SPEAKER_01]: really common pests, but sometimes people
get something really odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was very interested, I think,
to see things that were not as common in
[SPEAKER_01]: other crops and other plant life and that
kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is kind of where that took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did spend a couple of years in the
People's Republic of China in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: 2010s, and I worked in tea and I worked in
sorghum and a couple of other like grain
[SPEAKER_01]: crops and vegetable crops like tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go all around, but I mostly spent
my time in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai
[SPEAKER_01]: and Hangzhou, which is like the north and
kind of the southeast part of China of the
[SPEAKER_01]: People's Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was an interesting experience,
too, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of cannabis going on over there
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see any hemp or anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that that was somewhat of a
large crop at one point in China,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm not really sure when that would
have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have my my history that
well down on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, that exists and it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I'm not I'm not totally read up on
all the details, but there seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like a great, you know, some kind of a
gray market for, for example, I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like for research chemicals and like,
you know, compounds like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are people want to obtain maybe for
like a psychedelic effect or for no
[SPEAKER_01]: tropics or whatever, as long as it's not
on like the band list.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's a slightly different
compound that has a different name,
[SPEAKER_01]: then suddenly it's OK or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, it's like there's some of that
going on, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wish I could make up some like
really fantastic story, but I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: never got to see any, despite me being
very aware that it was there and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sadly, I just didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some like hemp products in the past
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I went to like places like Hu Zhou,
which was very agrarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think like more people, it was
interesting to hear older people talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would humor me a little bit through
my translator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did learn Chinese, but but not enough to
talk about that kind of a gray,
[SPEAKER_01]: gray topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really want to have any
miscommunication.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I feel like especially when you
connect through something as universal as
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture and then, you know,
being someone who was there to help
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent the pest damage to crops,
I feel like that's such a valuable role.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're like a protector of
sustenance at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does feel that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even what you said before,
where you said, I forget exactly the words
[SPEAKER_03]: that you used, but how we call them our
enemies right within the agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: field and how like pest itself as a
moniker is somewhat it has this negative
[SPEAKER_03]: connotation to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the you know, these these insects
definitely developed over time alongside
[SPEAKER_03]: of these different crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we even have things now where we have
hemp specific pests and cannabis specific
[SPEAKER_03]: pests that that don't necessarily harm
other crops, either to the same extent or
[SPEAKER_03]: degree or not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when did you start to then so it
sounds like you were in in China for a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years immediately, I'm assuming following
college or your your education towards
[SPEAKER_03]: this career path.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you came back to the States,
what what sort of drove your your path?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you sort of follow in terms of
the integrated pest management?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I basically at that point,
I'd already established my personal
[SPEAKER_01]: professional work, business, zenternal
consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at that point, I was fortunate
enough to have a lot of people I could
[SPEAKER_01]: contact, or that were contacted me about
various issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically just kept going with
clientele that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of long term people that I
would work with as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, I'm wearing the shirt for
Draymonector who put poinsettias on the
[SPEAKER_01]: map.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the reason why he think of
poinsettias as like a sort of a Christmas
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a funny story that goes along
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were that greenhouses since like the
they're like built in like the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, poinsettias used to only
have a single stalk and a single flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, they found one that they found
that one had multi branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they were able to propagate a lot
quicker, which allowed it to become more
[SPEAKER_01]: successful as a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that the same cultivar that they
use today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sorry, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the here's the here's the
interesting twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought it was genetic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the trait was vertically
transmitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of things do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing those though, they found that it
was actually this it is genetic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not endogenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a microbe that was inside their
body, a phytoplasma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phytoplasma is a really interesting
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they are really damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are oftentimes they have to be
affected by an insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we have a really destructive one
called Huanglongbing or citrus greening
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, or yellow dragon disease,
if you want the Chinese literal
[SPEAKER_01]: translation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that just messes up citrus in
California, in Florida, elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this this phytoplasma is really
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one that was in the poinsettias
just had this hormonal effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it caused the plant to sort of multi
branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it was able to even transmit
through the parentage, people thought it
[SPEAKER_01]: was genetic, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it makes me think of something
like hopslate and thyroid or something
[SPEAKER_03]: that is vertically transmittable across
cuttings, as well as even potentially
[SPEAKER_03]: progeny seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so but, you know, I guess it sounds
like you wouldn't have found this in say,
[SPEAKER_03]: a seed stock population from poinsettias
where you were then trying to narrow down
[SPEAKER_03]: this trait that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was then caused by the the virus or
the bacteria, you said?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did they end up somehow removing
the the phytoplasma from the poinsettia
[SPEAKER_03]: and lose this desirable trait?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or were they able to narrow it down to
what it was and somehow stabilize that
[SPEAKER_03]: within the plant further?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm just that's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure of the details, but I do know
that I think they found this out by
[SPEAKER_01]: accident, originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was because if I remember
right, it could be remembering wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the part of the part of
the reason was discovered by accident was
[SPEAKER_01]: because the the the ability to detect
these phytoplasmas recently became more
[SPEAKER_01]: common or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so like when they were going
through some sort of indexing process,
[SPEAKER_01]: they discovered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and but did they is this the same
then?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like from what I asked
earlier that this is the same cultivar
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're still using to have the multi
branch poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it still due to this this
phytoplasma bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I'm not sure if they make
use of the phytoplasma still or if they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to actually achieve like a
genetic and perhaps more reliable mode of
[SPEAKER_01]: action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually not sure if it's the same
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, if they breed with
other cultivars and they and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria passed down, perhaps it's still
not the same cultivar, technically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I do I do not know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be that this is no longer like
the case anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, along the same strand of
questioning, just considering it has to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with poinsettias, considering that they're
also a SCOTO dependent plant similar to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, what would you are there any
other similarities that you see with
[SPEAKER_03]: something that requires a specific longer
night cycle when it comes to pest
[SPEAKER_03]: management that you wouldn't necessarily
see in other crop plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you say that one more time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I might have jumbled my words a
little bit, but considering that both like
[SPEAKER_03]: poinsettias and cannabis require a certain
amount of darkness period in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: trigger their flowering, have you seen any
similarities within the pest management
[SPEAKER_03]: approaches between those two in terms of
specific pests that you might find with
[SPEAKER_03]: something that it has a longer night night
period?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think SCOTO periodicity is a big
part of it, but I think that you often
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot of people who grew ornamentals,
like cut flowers like gerbera,
[SPEAKER_01]: which these people did gerbera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's a lily here,
a calla lily, roses ornamentals in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people have experience with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does lend themselves to aspects of
cannabis biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like having SCOTO period dependent
development, often being annual,
[SPEAKER_01]: although not always with some
manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also say that there's some
literature, very old examples of solitary
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated literature that used to describe
cannabis as being like in the capacity as
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp, pretty pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I've also seen more recent
literature that has like an only reason I
[SPEAKER_01]: know about it because they targeted these
statements and are like, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not been our experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think what cannabis has going for
it and what I find very beautiful about
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is actually that it has a lot of
the same charm as a bamboo or for me at
[SPEAKER_01]: least, or like even like a dandelion or
similar type of plant that are like
[SPEAKER_01]: hawksbeard that grows really vigorously or
thistle starts out kind of herbaceous,
[SPEAKER_01]: hardens off and becomes like woody and
just grows really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find that trait really, I don't know,
I just think that's really cool that it
[SPEAKER_01]: can grow so fast and something comes,
it's like a cow or an animal comes in and
[SPEAKER_01]: munches it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can still like outgrow it, you know,
nominally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is one of the coolest parts about like
the cannabis plant where it grows so
[SPEAKER_03]: rapidly when given the correct environment
and conditions for growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll outgrow almost anything else in your
garden other than like a really well
[SPEAKER_03]: maintained tomato or something during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even those, they don't really
necessarily get that woody stalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not like a, you can't really turn
them into a tree, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best you can do is maybe a very little
long vine, but it is really fascinating
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis how quickly it grows and you
can see this entire life cycle in the
[SPEAKER_03]: course of three months, let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is really fascinating,
you know, and how the traits are passed
[SPEAKER_03]: from like the parent lineage down to
offspring in cannabis compared to things
[SPEAKER_03]: like tomatoes or potatoes or corn or
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see such huge, vast differences
within the progeny in my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe you have a different experience
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to actually get back a little bit
into where you then pivoted and
[SPEAKER_03]: transitioned your focus into cannabis
integrated pest management application and
[SPEAKER_03]: then also ask about your own personal
experiences with growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you have in the past but
aren't currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so maybe we can talk a little bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, cannabis was in the
beginning, even like pre-beginning to two
[SPEAKER_01]: degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with regards to like what I was
growing myself or like the kinds of things
[SPEAKER_03]: that people were growing or... Well,
let's maybe make it a two-parter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little bit about your own
personal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get a little bit of a grasp of
what you've personally experienced with
[SPEAKER_03]: growing cannabis and then also when you
transitioned into making that more of your
[SPEAKER_03]: professional path with integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say that like my favorite
example is I have three big stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me personally growing, I actually had,
you know, despite this is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: like how I recommend people in a
commercial space or something quasi
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial, whatever you call all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wouldn't recommend growing
this way, but I like when it's just me and
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care too much and I have
other avenues of access and that kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the context that I'm bringing up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually am a big overgrow type person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a big like I enjoy having a plant
kind of grow without a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction on my part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if I really care about the
produce or that kind of a thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I have a loquat tree that I planted
when I was in my parents house when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a teenager and we still take the
loquats out, you know, today as a big
[SPEAKER_01]: tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sometimes I've cut it back
so that I can get a certain yield or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally I'm actually kind of like a
said and forget it type person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also prefer to not like have a bunch
of rigmarole and like lights and that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a thing myself personally, but I love
visiting people who do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that my most informative
growing was actually when I was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: with my friends who were up in the high
desert in like, you know, where Lone Pine,
[SPEAKER_01]: California is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, but is that like independence or
Bishop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's by, it's around that area,
sort of the Inyo land and they had a
[SPEAKER_01]: river.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, they had access on the land
to a river that went down and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the cannabis plants in this sort
of high desert, high heat, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very high solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Context with a little bit of shade from
like some oak trees, I believe they were
[SPEAKER_01]: and this like kind of river that would
irrigate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like a really cool,
but very interesting situation because in
[SPEAKER_01]: some way, when it was nighttime,
you get all kinds of bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who've never been in the desert and
especially the high desert of California,
[SPEAKER_01]: Southwest North America in general is full
of bugs that love to be attracted to light
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but during, during the day can be
really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and some bugs will not be very active
and some bugs might actually, actually get
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but you are kind of insulated because
the only things around you are scrubby
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so were they like growing the
plants, uh, kind of like directly next to
[SPEAKER_03]: the river and just allowing the river to
irrigate them that way where they didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to water them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it sounds a lot like your style of
set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got the shade there to take
care of them so that they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily get burnt and they have plenty
of access to water and probably very
[SPEAKER_03]: nutritious water as well, considering all
the different silt and stuff that gets
[SPEAKER_03]: moved down the river and any biologicals
from fish or frogs or other, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: wildlife that kind of is near the streams
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's super fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I, I do know about the California
high desert and the bugs that you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get lots of, um, not necessarily
locusts, but, uh, grasshoppers and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, other things that'll just,
they'll chew through a crop of plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: no time flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also have the people,
uh, that you do have to account for
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes in, uh, in that, in desert
locations, there can be some, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: wanderers who are looking for something
interesting to do with their day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, uh, you know, I feel like as
human beings, if we see sort of a,
[SPEAKER_03]: an outcropping of trees or some greenery
and a vast landscape of a desert,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be drawn to it regardless
of what your intentions are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget my favorite,
uh, memory of that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is when it's maybe like 10, it's been like
10 years now, maybe, um, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there was like this huge snow
event and despite it being like the
[SPEAKER_01]: desert, um, you know, there was like tons
of snow packed, um, uh, away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like they had to like divert all the
snow off the road and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just like stayed there for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it was very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like, yeah, the, the mountains and
everything is very, it's very peaceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I find it really, I think people
who've never experienced it, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: desolate beauty of the, of the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that was very, um,
insightful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I could agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you always see in,
uh, in movies and stuff, the trope of
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are taking psychedelics and go
out to the desert to experience their,
[SPEAKER_03]: their psychedelic, uh, trip, because it is
like peaceful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just less around you to
distract you from whatever that is that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're trying to experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then so from, from that
experience, um, when you started to become
[SPEAKER_03]: more heavily involved in the cannabis,
uh, market as a integrated pest,
[SPEAKER_03]: pest management specialist, what were
some, uh, what were some experiences you
[SPEAKER_03]: had there that you'd like to share?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many that I could,
I think that, uh, for those who might be
[SPEAKER_01]: like listening and wondering to get some
like IPM insight, um, I think I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that like a big takeaway that's actually
surprisingly absent, uh, in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: space too, is actually to like know what
could be a threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprising how many people don't even know
some of these basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wish I could say it was like really,
I mean, it gives conflict a, that scale
[SPEAKER_01]: and different regions, um, and different
seasons can be different too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think not appreciating that as much as
you could, um, which is like a really
[SPEAKER_01]: common problem in all kinds of business,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not unique to cannabis,
but I feel like that's a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, many like different stories and
anecdotes of mine could maybe be boiled
[SPEAKER_01]: down to this, like maximum of like step
zero, learn the bugs and also learn what
[SPEAKER_01]: people do about them and also learn what
you can do about them for your unique
[SPEAKER_01]: context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's hard to account for like 50
plus possibilities and maybe like 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_01]: really common, um, things that people will
deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you, you know, to be
forewarned is to be forearmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's a message I like to share
for free to various people on my YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's why the Pest Primer series,
um, is what it is because I would get all
[SPEAKER_01]: these questions from people and I firmly
believe in the business statement that
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you have to be better than a Google
search.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I've said many times,
but, uh, up until just this very moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that it's outmoded because
people now use, um, you know, machine
[SPEAKER_01]: learning and AI now with the search
engine, um, uh, Ruhaha that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: been talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you know, essentially people can
find out information and your job is not
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a knowledge silo and be like,
give me money for the secret technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because the ultimate answer is almost
always, it depends on what you can or
[SPEAKER_01]: can't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so under is working under those
experiences and constraints that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, allows somebody to be, I think,
informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but no one's had every single
experience either.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like somewhere in between
education and intuition, um, that makes
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the human, um, approach to these
different problems and solutions much
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it's, I feel like there's a
more, um, I'm missing the word right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it helps when it comes to trying to
figure something out if rather than it
[SPEAKER_03]: being this rigid, like yes, no,
uh, like deduction versus induction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reasoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you have to put on your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like Sherlock Holmes cap for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what are some of the experiences
that you've had then with, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: integrated pest management that you felt
were, um, some of the biggest learning
[SPEAKER_03]: curves, uh, for yourself, maybe that kind
of fit into this idea of needing to,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, find a solution that fits the problem
in a specific scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that like, I think that the
biggest one could be like learning what
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a threat to what I just,
maybe the converse of what I just said,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, cause I've had people, I mean,
I've had people bring in, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had people panic over nothing and
find out that they spent a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_01]: time and effort on something that wasn't
an issue, like some soul mitre or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was sort of commonplace,
um, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it comes from the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also, um, something I've kind of a
bit of a white whale for me and you tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me if this is answering your question or
if you want me to be more, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, precise in the, in the answer,
but I feel as though, uh, like people
[SPEAKER_01]: believe something without, um,
looking at the data and that could either
[SPEAKER_01]: be because they're ambivalent about it,
um, or they're desperate and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the time or even like the technical
knowledge to like make an assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're for, you know,
for example, or some, somebody they've
[SPEAKER_01]: hired, you know, an employee or something
like that in the commercial space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's just you growing with your
friends, it's still the same scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you and your friend who's
helping you out with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you both don't know something,
it's effectively the same problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, so I feel like, I feel like that
is, uh, an issue that, that's quite
[SPEAKER_01]: common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way you ameliorate that is
by, you know, being open-minded,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to learn this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people like give you a solution,
you know, um, at least try to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, try to try to find out, you know,
other people also agree with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's just surprising to me how
often I've come across people who,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard people say something like,
um, powdery mildew is not a problem of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pest as much as it's a problem of like
airflow, let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've totally heard that where then people
think, oh, I just need to adjust my
[SPEAKER_03]: airflow and the powdery mildew is going to
go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, um, yeah, I've, I've totally ran into
that, but it, it's not, I, I feel like I
[SPEAKER_03]: see where you're going with this,
where it's like, if you already have
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew, then the airflow isn't the
problem anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: The powdery mildew is now the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, maybe airflow was the reason why it,
uh, occurred, but even that is kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: misnomer because you need to take into
account, uh, heat and humidity and airflow
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, other, uh, either high humidity
events or low humidity events that could
[SPEAKER_03]: cause a sporulation event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just requires all these different
angles to be looked at, um, rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: just, oh, it's airflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because humidity is a, is actually like a
cumulative factor of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also having the pest is a factor of
also other things and those mesh together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, essentially, cause whenever I
ask people, what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't really tell me what they mean
by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just an, it's like a logical amulet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this is my, you know,
this is my anti-snake mouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell because there's no snakes
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that kind of stuff, I think
violence and ice cream, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the sale of ice cream goes up because
violence is high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, no, it's hot as hell out
and people are agitated and they like ice
[SPEAKER_01]: cream and it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, and again, like,
you know, are you seriously Matt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, basic logical issues are the
other problem sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the word, the, the most, um,
uh, interesting might not be the best
[SPEAKER_01]: word, but like the, the things where I
feel like I feel the most accomplished or
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like something really good happened
here was because it was situations where
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were doing everything right and
they knew, and they're like talented and
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got an expert panel of people and
they're doing everything's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then like something, something that
they thought was true is now false or
[SPEAKER_01]: something I thought that was false is now
true, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it becomes a forensics question
because the system worked fine until just
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something has happened here and it's
really, um, knowing like a bunch of niche
[SPEAKER_01]: esoterica, uh, is really great in that
scenario, um, where you have an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: system of like hundreds of thousands or
millions of dollars grind to a halt
[SPEAKER_01]: because, uh, there's a new fungus in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and maybe your protocol weren't up to
snuff or they were, but somebody was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something wrong because you hired them new
or recently or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all of these things can come together
and coalesce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of, um, like how there's
the, uh, there's a video of like a Petri
[SPEAKER_03]: dish where it has different layers of,
um, antibiotics on it that are at
[SPEAKER_03]: different strengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they put the bacteria at the one
end of the Petri dish and it hits these
[SPEAKER_03]: antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a while to break through them,
but then eventually breaks through them
[SPEAKER_03]: because of either, uh, uh, reproduction,
uh, creating some sort of resistance to
[SPEAKER_03]: that bacteria or it's the antibiotic,
uh, selection pressure, the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: survive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or 10%, but then those all
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it's a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so sometimes when you, when you do get
into like almost, uh, cause growing is
[SPEAKER_03]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the same process over and over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like a lot of people don't
necessarily take that into account when
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to enter into the cultivation
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think that it's, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be, you know,
hunting and they're going to be having all
[SPEAKER_03]: this, this cool weed that they can test or
try out and, Oh, look at us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing these awesome flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but in the end, like it, when you get,
you know, 20 crops deep in one year,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you get to the next year and it's
well, you're maybe expanded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's 30 crops in that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just over and over and over
again, things are the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't notice where those
different, you know, like maybe a standard
[SPEAKER_03]: might falter because it wasn't,
you weren't seeing an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you stop paying attention to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it falters and then you go,
Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, everything grinds to a halt
and they don't, you don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do have to be like, I always say,
go back to basics, try to just read.
[SPEAKER_03]: Restart, um, and, and make sure that you
do have good plans in place and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and SOPs, especially when it comes to
integrated pest management, that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't just trying to reset, if you can't
figure it out, then it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: something like a child tasting event that,
uh, does kind of hinder the progress over
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so when you, when you've found these,
uh, or had these experiences where.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was satisfying because it was sort of,
you know, everything was working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then all of a sudden it were, it wasn't,
um, what are some of those pitfalls that
[SPEAKER_03]: you see, you tend to see, um, whether it
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: IPM or otherwise that you've been able to
help people identify within their grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm tempted to say that a lot of times
it's actually, it could be like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, but I think this is true at any scale
actually, whether it's like a large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial situation, or it's a relatively
small cottage scale or even just somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's scale, it's scale agnostic,
but actually it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: something changed with the personnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's one person, you know, then it's
like, you are that person, but in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: like changes in people in what you might
call like infrastructural wisdom or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or like, uh, infrastructural knowledge or
institutional knowledge, um, is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oftentimes hard to quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and a lot of people, I think
understand this in like their heart of
[SPEAKER_01]: hearts, uh, that like, you know,
there's like this thing and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: now that that is not there anymore for
whatever reason, somebody left or,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, maybe those people who are executing,
uh, are having something going on or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing fine, but the equipment that
they use, you know, didn't get checked a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, you know, the people who are
applying something were fine, but
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately the product wasn't mixed or,
you know, things like this where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes like, uh, sort of a cacophony
of different small things, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you don't notice it, uh,
for example, but potentially at least you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't notice it because, um, if you're
doing preventative stuff and there just
[SPEAKER_01]: happens to be no snakes, you know,
to go back to the amulet example,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, then you think everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as soon as it breaks down,
uh, when I was working with the Gerber
[SPEAKER_01]: growing people here, uh, we had,
uh, and we had a really big scare because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was powdery mildew and, uh,
we applied or we didn't, I didn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they applied, um, a fungicide for it
and there was no effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, pesticide companies take this
very seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot, especially with powdery
mildew, but a lot of other pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have been known to develop
resistances within the season that a new
[SPEAKER_01]: product is like introduced or even
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause the selection pressure is
already there, but we found out that the
[SPEAKER_01]: product just wasn't applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but they claim that it was applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we thought that it was applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they thought, they thought it was
applied to, like, it wasn't, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: subterfuge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oops, it just didn't,
like, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the one growery job that called in
sick that day or something as simple as
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not remember exactly how it happened,
but I think it has to do with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, who is mixing versus who is
applying and some kind of a, some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: an honest mix up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they, I think they found the mixed
up product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, this was obviously the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause if it got sprayed, then
obviously it would be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so something else happened,
like just with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that kind of stuff happens and it
constantly lots of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And time and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it, it, you know, you do never
think about it until, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you either lose that worker that's been
doing all these little things to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, putting the gum in between this
and that's that they hold together for
[SPEAKER_03]: just long enough, uh, you know,
going and kicking this one piece of
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the right spot every day to make sure
that it kicks on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, obviously those are silly
examples, but I do, but it's true though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know that, cause I, I manage a
facility and there are so many little
[SPEAKER_03]: things that have to be done regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, some of them irregularly where
it's more of a, you have to notice that
[SPEAKER_03]: the water lines are starting to slow down
to think, oh, I gotta go and clean out the
[SPEAKER_03]: filter for this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one line that doesn't really need
cleaning that often, but only when it does
[SPEAKER_03]: start to affect the flow of water,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, stuff like that is very, uh,
it's like, very user dependent almost
[SPEAKER_03]: where you have to have the, the experience
or experience dependent, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, just to make sure that you are hitting
all those or checking off all those boxes
[SPEAKER_03]: that need to be checked off just to make
sure that everything is continuing to move
[SPEAKER_03]: in the direction that you want it to for
the production of the facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what, uh, maybe I'll, I'll leave it
open just for a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some other stories that you
wanted to talk about perhaps, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to either IPM or cannabis or
otherwise?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, uh, something I've been on a
kick on is research into like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having a respect for pests,
I suppose, let me back up and say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that like going back to the
original reason why I even got into all
[SPEAKER_01]: this was having an affinity for something
that a lot of times, uh, was a pest or a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, um, for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in the forest or in the ecosystem,
we don't really care as much, but as a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop pest, certainly a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that like, it lulls people
into a sort of false sense of superiority,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily security, although they
can derive that feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I think it is sort of like a
feeling like, you know, I've heard all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of weird claims like, um,
you know, uh, a plant at some weirdly
[SPEAKER_01]: quantified level of health, whatever that
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it just cannot get pests or
it's not possible for it to succumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it sounds, if it sounds
like, uh, like vitalism, if you've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of this, uh, sort of, um, esoteric
concept, this like, uh, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like there's a, a vitality that just
can't be, um, it's almost like a spiritual
[SPEAKER_01]: argument rather than like one that's
maybe, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm not a specialist in that sort of
thing, but I think that if I had made that
[SPEAKER_01]: comment to a client, they would laugh at
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and maybe like, I don't know,
press charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't think that's accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, for a lot of people,
but some people, um, make these claims or
[SPEAKER_01]: they make that something, um, around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, some people seem to find it
convincing and it's, and it's like the
[SPEAKER_01]: snake amulet, you know, it's fine until
they actually deal with something where it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't fine enough or they were benefiting
from something else, potentially,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, another in this rut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of thing too is
problematic, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it is why I try to be so
empirical all the time.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it feels like another,
um, confusion of cause and correlation,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, just like if you, if you go,
um, oh, I have, uh, the, the healthiest
[SPEAKER_03]: crops, the, the most productive crops that
I have are from the healthiest plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: my healthiest plants don't have pest
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the health of my plants is causing the
pests to go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, not necessarily, it's probably
more about your either refined or,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, adequate integrated pest management
applications that are causing the pest to
[SPEAKER_03]: go away, which are causing your plants to
be healthier, which is causing your yields
[SPEAKER_03]: to go up or your quality to go up or
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I see it all the time, uh, especially,
um, you know, in facilities where people
[SPEAKER_03]: were battling pests of some kind,
and then they are able to either reduce
[SPEAKER_03]: them below the economic threshold or
remove them altogether.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden everything is working
so much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it does kind of show how important
it is to have a really good integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: pest management, either specialist like
yourself, uh, on call or a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: plan in place that can be applied by the
staff already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what are some of the, uh, the biggest
things that you're seeing currently that
[SPEAKER_03]: people are battling with in, uh,
in pest management?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, whether that be like pests themselves
or the application of specific,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, protocols or methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, it's kind of related to the one
before I would say like, um, crop
[SPEAKER_01]: scouting, like there's various pests that
are really common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I've been on a kick on that respect
for pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that respect is like,
um, you know, like resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities, like you had mentioned just
now pretty, pretty, pretty eloquently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the importance of like
understanding that like maybe this season
[SPEAKER_01]: it was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and maybe for many seasons in your
particular area, it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get passed over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's just statistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, people ask me like, like you just said
with the IPM plan, like, Oh, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, why don't use that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, you know, but maybe like,
maybe in the, I can't tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't prove a negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, maybe this, maybe the ambulance real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, um, but my, but the thing that I
think a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a big thing for me, I think is,
is having the logistical bandwidth to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate your own crop at a regular
interval, uh, seems to be like the start
[SPEAKER_01]: and stop of a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, again, like people can do things
like probably your experience has been
[SPEAKER_01]: this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you had the right plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't get executed as timely as
maybe would have been ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you have knockoff effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on a time, oftentimes being able to
sort of really ship that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that it does require
investment of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does require sometimes that you trust
somebody or you are going to be the person
[SPEAKER_01]: who does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you trust somebody with something
else that you couldn't trust somebody with
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's kind of like, it's,
I think that is like the, the pre barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: to even considering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I do find that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when it comes to the commercial
application of things that having a.
[SPEAKER_03]: A preventative measure in place,
rather than a reactive measure in place is
[SPEAKER_03]: always going to be your best bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, putting that responsibility into
someone else's hands, you're saying that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm prioritizing this responsibility to
someone other than myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Due to the case that you're prioritizing
higher or more important things to your
[SPEAKER_03]: own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Responsibilities, but in some cases,
I found, like, even even with some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: more simple tasks within a grow
environment that by taking those on
[SPEAKER_03]: yourselves and passing on a more complex
aspect of the grow to someone else,
[SPEAKER_03]: it not only teaches them, but it also
helps make sure that you can then rely on
[SPEAKER_03]: them further with even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bigger, more important tasks in the
future, but it does mean that you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: trust them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially with it's one of those
things that if you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess misplaced trust can be a huge,
huge downfall in.
[SPEAKER_03]: In certain aspects of cultivation,
one of the things that I've experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was we had a few aphids.
[SPEAKER_03]: In in the grow and.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came in off of cuttings that we took
from an outdoor population, trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: preserve them from a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those aphids came inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to isolate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a spreading event of some kind can't
pinpoint it down to exactly when it
[SPEAKER_03]: happened, but it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were then able to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Target and treat those pests while
continuing to try to stay on top of the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest of the crop without applying harsh
chemicals or a harsh chemistry and.
[SPEAKER_03]: That eventually led to small populations
moving throughout the facility and
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually ending up in a flowering room
and.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making part of the crop unharvestable
basically, which.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can't necessarily say,
well, it's because we brought the cuttings
[SPEAKER_03]: in from outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, you could go all the way back
to that and say that's the exact reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why we had aphids and.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that is the reason why we had
aphids, but there were other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Potential ways to prevent their spread
that necessarily either weren't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Addressed early enough or aggressively
enough, and we eventually had a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of crop loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that is also.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my keeping in mind that we,
we really did try to stay on top of it and
[SPEAKER_03]: we were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the biggest downfall was trying to
bring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clones in from outside, which is something
that I don't plan on doing in the future,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was something that we at least can
now say, hey, we did a lot to try and
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent the spread of both pathogens and
pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't work, so we either need to
try something different next time that
[SPEAKER_03]: this happens, or we need to say we just
don't have it within our bandwidth to
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent this from happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just should prevent it by not doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, well, like, for example,
the fact that you even were was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: recount.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were able to recount all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe part of his supposition,
you know, like a lot of times you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: like you can't actually know you had to
like trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And act like a detective and kind of piece
things together, even though you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: like cast a spell and like know what
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see their tracks through the grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, but like being able to kind
of like forensically analyze yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: even, and being able to have the team and
also the like, you know, wherewithal to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that even is like really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that that's really commendable
because that's what allows you to make
[SPEAKER_01]: those informed decisions afterwards and
have, and hopefully maybe even have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, you would like, you know,
you would you would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, attract it like during a
quarantine phase, you know, so like taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the cuttings isn't necessarily the bad
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, it's like, is it the fault
of you taking cuttings?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in a way, it's the fault that the
person giving you the plants had bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we shouldn't trust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not about trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I think people naturally also
I think are a little denigrating there,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to like, whose fault is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was all it was all our fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was all our fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all our there's no one else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was many layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this like there's this like
survivability onion and the first layer
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapped away and the second layer went
away and also the third and the fourth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are multiple small failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that you even had checks in
that is better than most people anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our approach to at the facility that I
helped manage, it was helped designed by
[SPEAKER_03]: Suzanne Wainwright Evans, and she's also,
you know, really well educated and
[SPEAKER_03]: approachable person like yourself when it
comes to cannabis pests, because there are
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people that don't necessarily
have the direct experience with cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: crops and pests, or or they're just
applying chemistries that might work in
[SPEAKER_03]: other crops that have similar pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, oh, it's a soft bodied
insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can use this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do really appreciate it, especially
considering from someone like yourself,
[SPEAKER_03]: who, as far as I know, were and might
still be a user of cannabis products that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, applying the wrong chemistries
at the wrong times makes the end product
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes unusable for people with either
specific conditions or ailments or
[SPEAKER_03]: sensitivities.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I guess to get back, though,
to some of your experience within the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cultivation industry,
what are some of the biggest successes
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've seen where you went into a
facility?
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gave them a maybe even like a simple
plan and they followed it and boom,
[SPEAKER_03]: took care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite example probably is from
German nectar again, just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my one of my earlier ones,
earliest ones where I felt like I was
[SPEAKER_01]: super valuable was actually one of the
major one of the major reasons I was even
[SPEAKER_01]: contracted with them was because they had
some people who had been growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had some workers who'd been there for
like 35 years and they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how to use new technology like an
iPad to scout for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm being honest, you know,
they were extremely talented people and I
[SPEAKER_01]: totally get not wanting to like learn
something, some newfangled thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but unfortunately, you know, they were
duplicating data a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that took a lot of their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pest that they dealt with that we
we together developed a system for was
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf miner fly in Gerbera daisies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not normally a pest of Gerbera,
but for those who don't know what leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: miner is, it's a it's a fly, usually
Liriomyza.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a yellow black body and they're
kind of pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mosca Pinta, the painted fly in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would happen is that the larvae
are are laid in the leaf materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: eggs, and then they as they grow together,
they create these like patterns in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves because they're they're mining
through it, creating these tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they come out, they pupate,
become a fly, and the cycle continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, their leaves have gotten
skeletonized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so full of leaf miner fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still remember the weeks, the peak time
we would get them is week 29.
[SPEAKER_01]: So weeks 29 through 32 was like,
I think if I'm checking my time right,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like the dead of summer,
like June or July somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would see we would use this iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would track the numbers of flies that
we would get on the glue traps that we put
[SPEAKER_01]: in each greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody would come around, collect all of
them, literally count all of them and put
[SPEAKER_01]: that information into a data program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would see that data visualize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people do this, but it's
really useful because when we release
[SPEAKER_01]: these wasps called diglyphous,
which we've used several times in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past, we would get some effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually we were able to use the
data to see exactly when the leaf miners
[SPEAKER_01]: would go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a regression analysis to kind of
check the relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, long story short,
we saved like $250,000 of basically
[SPEAKER_01]: product loss a combination of a product
gain or getting rid of the loss and more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient use of the diglyphous,
which were pretty expensive at like 50
[SPEAKER_01]: cents a wasp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get like hundreds at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're releasing a mass population into
what I'm assuming is like a large
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse area or something like that
with active fans and stuff that are just
[SPEAKER_03]: going to decimate anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: But was it just by adjusting the release
date perhaps in correlation to the
[SPEAKER_03]: population boom to help make sure that it
kept it under control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like that those like two or three
weeks are like the place where we get like
[SPEAKER_01]: the most damage because you're seeing the
adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the adult population goes up to the
larval population is about to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't see that because
they're not in the sticky card and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you see the adult population the next week
or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being really successful here allowed me
to convince my collaborators.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who hired me, the admin staff
loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who had to learn how to use the
iPad were not huge fans at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they just couldn't look at that
and go whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were really that allowed them to
buy into a process that actually made
[SPEAKER_01]: their lives really simple once they
learned how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was adjustment of the timing
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it also made us not have to buy
so many in the future, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of a double whammy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we continued to do that for the
rest of that season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then moving into, you know,
because like Valentine's Day and Mother's
[SPEAKER_01]: Day are the biggest flower days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really couldn't let the plants get
super damaged because we would have them
[SPEAKER_01]: for multiple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they got really damaged in
summertime and then autumn and winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wouldn't have as much sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they come in, they get stunted,
it gets cold, and then they come into
[SPEAKER_01]: spring really raggedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would have this multi-year
effect, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to kick that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really salubrious to their
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like that sort of knock-on effect of
when you can target the pest early.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all of the ramifications of that
and the increase in plant health over
[SPEAKER_03]: time, even in a short crop like cannabis,
is extremely beneficial, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: catching it early rather.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, also why I had said
earlier, it's so much more beneficial to
[SPEAKER_03]: be preventive than reactionary or
reactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being the Gerbera daisies,
have you had any sort of immediate
[SPEAKER_03]: successes where you, you know,
you went and found the problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzed what was causing the problem,
and then were able to implement a solution
[SPEAKER_03]: all within the course of perhaps one
growth cycle within cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one example, like rice through aphids
are really common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I usually get like two schools of
thought with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is people who have, like one person
told me recently, it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to paraphrase it, but it was
like, my experience with aphids is like
[SPEAKER_01]: small and harrowing, you know,
like really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only experience I had was terrible,
but I don't have that much experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, people tell me it can be
dealt with, can we do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have people who have like kind
of learned what works best for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And assuming that they like screen for
them and they find them early,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no problem for them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, it can be very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very different, but I think my
favorite example probably exists within a
[SPEAKER_01]: rice through aphid example where I think
my favorite one is when I was working with
[SPEAKER_01]: this indoor grow and they had been dealing
with rice through aphid for like two years
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point, which I actually wasn't
aware of at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually transplant, they had to
bring all their plants from a different
[SPEAKER_01]: location to this location.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just kind of brought them with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were already aware of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main issue was basically that I
think it was really a matter of not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting enough effectively coverage
because they, well, again, kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: other examples I mentioned, like they knew
some of the products to use and they knew
[SPEAKER_01]: that you had to apply it maybe more than
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that wasn't a mystery or anything,
but for whatever reason, it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to bump up the, we actually
got very creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to bump up the Buveria Bosiana use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those who don't know, that's a
fungus that attacks various insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, the rice root aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually ended up dunking,
I think a few times we actually ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: like dunking the entire pot in like a huge
amount of like inocula.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could see all of these aphids get
micro size, like little furry puff balls
[SPEAKER_01]: all around the, the pots and the,
and the roots and things when we would
[SPEAKER_01]: check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was laborious though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we had to do it more than thrice,
but it was effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you use any, anything else with the
Buveria Bosiana as a, as a knockdown or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything within that, that root ball
drenching?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We alternated, if I remember correctly,
between a pyrethrin product and an
[SPEAKER_01]: azadirachtin product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are usually my favorite one,
one, two punches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those, those three in conjunction seem to
be the only thing that I've ever been able
[SPEAKER_03]: to use in order to knock down rice root
aphids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they're one of the most pernicious
pests that I've ever dealt with in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think you get rid of them and then all
of a sudden you see a flyer somewhere and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're just like, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that there is a population
somewhere that I have not been able to
[SPEAKER_03]: track down or eradicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unlike fungus gnats, where you can
pretty much, you know, scrape away the top
[SPEAKER_03]: layer of potting mix that you're using,
apply something like Buveria Bosiana or is
[SPEAKER_03]: it bacillus thuringiensis that works well
on, on, on fungus gnats as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacillus thuringiensis, Israelensis,
I think BTI is the fly strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mosquito dunks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you can get rid of those
pretty easily, but then with, with rice
[SPEAKER_03]: root aphids, they seem to be able to
burrow well into the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unless you really get a good drench
through the entire substrate, it seems as
[SPEAKER_03]: though they just aren't necessarily,
they're just not easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently found a product, Botanogard
Max, where it is pyrethrins and Buveria
[SPEAKER_03]: Bosiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have been really enjoying that for
just, uh, preventative, um, works well on,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, uh, fungus gnats as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, but yeah, finding the right
chemistry, I feel like that's,
[SPEAKER_03]: and using the right amounts is so
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, uh, what do I always hear?
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the label is the law, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to make sure that you're
following it correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it's not just necessarily because
they don't want it to be toxic because
[SPEAKER_03]: like, some of these are, are much safer
than, um, a lot of people are led to
[SPEAKER_03]: believe when the pesticide, uh,
you know, name is added to what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel like a lot of pesticides,
I feel like just based on how media
[SPEAKER_03]: portrays them as being extremely
dangerous, even to humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but some of them are just very,
uh, innocuous to humans and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: but work only within the range that
they're given, you know, too much of it
[SPEAKER_03]: might eventually make, uh, some sort of
resistant species and whatever you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get rid of, or too little just
doesn't do a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, speaking of selection
pressure, you know, that's, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a thing that I think is,
uh, um, although people do appreciate it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes they don't appreciate
that that also is true for things like
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even copper, I remember I was reading
an article from last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a type of aphid,
uh, that was, uh, colonizing pepper plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Netherlands and other parts of
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why copper made a statement
was because they found that actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid was, um, resistant to parasoid
wasps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how they quantified that or,
or anything, but, uh, if they're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, then, you know, I assume that
they're willing to be forthright,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause you'd have no reason to
mention that like kind of perversely
[SPEAKER_01]: incentivize not to mention that,
but it was very responsible thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say, if you feel like that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that there's aphids that have
like little, uh, viral, um, symbionts of
[SPEAKER_01]: their bacteria in their body that,
that create toxins that kill these wasps
[SPEAKER_01]: larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bacteriophage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally those kill bacteria, but it's
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lysogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually integrated into the
genome of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that bacteria has, it is in the,
um, Hamiltonela defensa is in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, is one example, at least where this
process happens in a lot of aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so when the wasps puts its,
I know, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puts his egg in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the bacteria produces these,
um, these toxins and they kill the larva
[SPEAKER_01]: as it develops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then also different bacteriophages
had different mutations of these toxins
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, make them more or less
survivable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, uh, really complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think that although it's not
really possible to check for this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing in the field, um, it's the kind of
thing where, like, like, if you know this,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it alters your perspective on,
on ecology, on your SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more you know, the better.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of the, the Marvel
villain venom where it's, uh, like a
[SPEAKER_03]: symbiote that helps the, you know,
the wrongdoings of this, uh, of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of this villain, almost like where the,
the, uh, the aphids are the villain in
[SPEAKER_03]: this, but of course that's just,
uh, me anthropomorphizing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but like, no, I get what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a deadly dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, you know, one of the things that I'm
always so very concerned about is the
[SPEAKER_03]: overuse of specific pesticides like
pyrethrins where, um, considering it is
[SPEAKER_03]: just like a contact kill, uh, due to the,
I believe it interferes with the nervous
[SPEAKER_03]: system of the, of the pest, um,
that there can be resiliences that develop
[SPEAKER_03]: in populations over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, again, that's also why applying
the correct amount of chemistry is so
[SPEAKER_03]: important because if you don't kill them,
um, rapidly, uh, or at least knock down
[SPEAKER_03]: the population rapidly, then you have that
much more potential for them to gain these
[SPEAKER_03]: different resiliences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, are there any experiences,
uh, like that, that you've faced where
[SPEAKER_03]: people were applying the same product over
and over and over again, and a pest just
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually worked its way back into their
settings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, it's, it's sometimes it's hard
to confirm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's hard to be like, like really like
epistemologically sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but sometimes it's a little bit
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the example that always comes to my
mind was, is a like LA grower I worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with maybe six years ago now, and they
had, um, they had a rice root aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, but they had, they had,
ostensibly they had gotten rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no problems for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had checked everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I didn't find out this part
until later, but we found that they had
[SPEAKER_01]: recently uprooted a bunch of like this,
like, like Virginia creeper vine or some
[SPEAKER_01]: other kind of vine I forget now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like Ivy or something that was all
across their building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the hosts for rice root
aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it seems like, and also the reason
why I was so sure was there was also like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like, like feral barley or rye or
whatever that you see in cracks and
[SPEAKER_01]: sidewalks and places, you know,
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pulled out the roots and it's like,
there's a rice root aphid right there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and there are a couple of other
others that were on like the plants and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, in the, in the, in the
property space and they had this door,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, going inside and it was like an inch
like of, of like clear clearance,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, spacious for a rice
root aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I think that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe even the rice, perhaps the
rice root aphids were inevitable at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point, um, based on their proximity,
but you know, it might've had a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a happier couple of seasons, um,
if you, if that hadn't happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So funny things that you don't think about
can become a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the same thing is true on a macro
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you accept that as true,
you know, we should also consider that as
[SPEAKER_01]: people grow more, whether it's at their
home or commercially or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, things like certain bud
worms, cannabis aphids, rice root aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: other pests that are common in other
places too, you know, maybe for 15 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was fine growing where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then suddenly this influx
eventually builds up this critical mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it takes multiple years,
but then once that started, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you get, you know, powdery mildew,
um, every year when it used to only get it
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people have to consider
that that can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things don't say that the same,
everything changes in a dynamic system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um, yeah, it goes back to some of
the earlier examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about of, um, just be
like, if you stay complacent within a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific system and you don't necessarily
look for the potential pitfalls,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you won't be prepared when you run
into them and, um, things, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: like, um, pests and pathogens that can
build up sort of that threshold before
[SPEAKER_03]: they spill over and become recognizable,
you know, whether it be, uh, through mold,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the spore count within a facility,
if you're not maintaining something as
[SPEAKER_03]: simple as cleaning your floors,
uh, and then you kick up a bunch of dust
[SPEAKER_03]: and dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those spores get a nice little ride on
the airways over to whatever plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a nice humid night and boom,
now you have more spores than you had
[SPEAKER_03]: before because you have fruiting bodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so it can definitely be a knock on
event of just a continued, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, continued maintenance and
continued, um, upkeep of the little things
[SPEAKER_03]: can make a huge difference in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see, what are, what are,
um, so when you do deal with home growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, considering that you have a presence
with the cheap home grow show,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, with the growing with my fellow
growers and your, uh, Instagram presence,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I personally have reached out to
you for a quick question here and there
[SPEAKER_03]: about something that I found within my
grow that I either couldn't find through a
[SPEAKER_03]: Google search or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what are some of the, uh, issues that
you feel like new growers face that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could give some advice on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I already gave a couple of good ones,
know your, know your bugs, know your
[SPEAKER_01]: potential problems, and also keep an open
mind as a corollary, uh, that new things
[SPEAKER_01]: can happen too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to have the whole
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has the whole picture, not even me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we just have, I, maybe I have one of
the more whole pictures, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're still learning things all the
time with cannabis and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that you also made some really
great points too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just even basic hygiene is super
invaluable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that having, you know,
finding the time, especially in a home
[SPEAKER_01]: grow situation should be easiest in some
ways to be able to actually look over your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants being very detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, looking, you know,
don't just look at the leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: look under the leaves, look if you can at
the crown of the plant where it meets the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate, you know, if you can up-pot the
plant and look at the roots, do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if that's tenable, um, you know,
be, I would say make a regular habit of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for also, um, typical signs of
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I have a pest primer videos on my
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes over what they look like various
pests and their damage and that kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, there's a lot of really
brilliant, um, academic, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: resources for people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's very much out there,
um, for free for people to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to take a little bit of
time and kind of learn some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super, that's like probably the
best investment of time you could take
[SPEAKER_01]: like two or three hours even, you know,
a day for a few weeks and you like really
[SPEAKER_01]: learn and commit to memory some of these
pests and their common treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll, you'll do really well,
especially if you're newer and that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I guess also like the,
the importance of, um, uh, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll, I'll stay, I'll,
I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely is probably, uh, especially
when it comes to pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be your biggest tool,
um, as a new grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you don't know what to look for,
uh, you won't spot it when it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes catching things early is the
best way to, um, prevent a, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: an absolute loss in your crop,
as well as then you'll have that under
[SPEAKER_03]: your tool belt to say, I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what it looks like when it starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be able to catch it earlier next
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you did find a good way to get rid
of it, you can just say, Hey, I'm just
[SPEAKER_03]: going to incorporate that in my
preventative maintenance rather than,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, having to ever deal with this again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you also have, you know,
the ability to deal with it if it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think that's great, you know,
new, new growers, especially when it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to pests and pathogens, uh, it's,
it's not necessarily a taboo subject,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it is something that people don't like
to talk about because, um, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: frightening it, uh, to, to think that you
can lose all of this time and effort that
[SPEAKER_03]: you put into a grow, uh, just because you
missed the fact that there is some bugs in
[SPEAKER_03]: there or missed the fact that there's
some, some mold in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, maybe, maybe due to your
circumstances, if your plant has any mold
[SPEAKER_03]: on it at all, then you need to dispose of
it or turn it into edibles or something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's not what you're desiring in
your end product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, you know, also considering just
how big of a, uh, seems like a,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I don't know if taboo is the right
word, but it seems like it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: something where people don't want to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, pests are, you know,
it's, it's hard to deal with if you get
[SPEAKER_03]: them and it's, um, you know, even harder
to anticipate sometimes how you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent certain bugs at certain times of
years in certain environments,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's a lot to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and with all that in consideration,
do you feel as though, or what do you feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like maybe um, swept under the rug a
little bit within the industry where
[SPEAKER_03]: people try to ignore perhaps the signs of
issue until it's too late?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I think that a lot of,
uh, I think a lot of it come, I think an
[SPEAKER_01]: oversimple thing to say would be that it
comes down to ego, but it's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what I mean by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's maybe sometimes part
of it, but it it's not like, it's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people, in my experience,
not like a lot of people are growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's cannabis or other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, a lot of times you're not
growing in a supportive environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, in a healthy
relationship, you're probably not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get everything wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, shocker, but you're probably not
going to get everything right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say, ooh, shocker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you will make a mistake at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the question is how big of a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question also is, you know,
are, you know, does the company even
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate that you did every,
all this other stuff, save them tons of
[SPEAKER_01]: money to whatever talented person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or, you know, I guess it depends on
the severity, of course, but my point is
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of times you're not even
allowed to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times that is going to be a ding
to your credibility or if something bad
[SPEAKER_01]: happens and it's not even your fault in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times the draconian, um,
sort of overarching perspective is the
[SPEAKER_01]: context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that causes, and it's very common
agriculture, um, especially a lot of like
[SPEAKER_01]: super hierarchy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's the case, then there's not,
there's a perverse incentive to not admit
[SPEAKER_01]: that you either know something is a
problem or that you, um, did anything
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't create a healthy system
for flexibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like, especially considering,
uh, and maybe this might be more cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: specific scenario, but there is so much
branding behind the different,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, successful businesses within this
industry that if you, yeah, no one wants
[SPEAKER_03]: to be associated with improper practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, if, if you say, Hey,
you like the way that that smokes awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been spraying it with chemicals all
the way up to week four of, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and it still had mold and some
pests on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you like it now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, some people are going to,
you know, stare at you blank face because
[SPEAKER_03]: they have no idea that cannabis was grown
as a plant in a crop, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some people are, some people are
going to be disgusted by that and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, that's because you're growing
non-organically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's because you're, you know,
you know, this, that, and the other thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that they can start to point fingers at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, it's a perception is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when it comes to, uh, branding and,
and the development of branding,
[SPEAKER_03]: the brand's and the ability to maintain,
uh, uh, you know, a profitable business
[SPEAKER_03]: model within what is currently one of
probably the.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it has like the biggest highs
and the biggest lows right now out of an
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural industry within the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, maybe not outside of the country,
but, um, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through my experience, it seems like,
you know, people want cannabis and they
[SPEAKER_03]: want really good cannabis, but they don't
want to keep spending more money on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it keeps getting better, they don't
want to, um, learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's more to be learned about it,
uh, they just want the product,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is unfortunately, uh, you know,
we are within this capitalistic economy
[SPEAKER_03]: that we live in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of par for the course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I keep hearing people say
that, Oh, at some point, this is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: turn around the different, the price
points of the different pounds that people
[SPEAKER_03]: can sell with in the commercial market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or that, uh, you know, things are
going to get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but I don't, I don't really see that
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, as the, as the cost of
production continues to go down,
[SPEAKER_03]: the.
[SPEAKER_03]: The product is going to need to cost less
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as there's more supply, the,
and the demand isn't necessarily going up,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to also drive the price down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're in for a reckoning of some
kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, to say the least,
um, but I do, I do think that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, you know, people don't,
yeah, people don't really like to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about the pest aspect of things and they
really don't want to be viewed as someone
[SPEAKER_03]: who has done something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and, and I see how you could
say that it is ego, but also how it may
[SPEAKER_03]: not necessarily be completely tied to ego
because, you know, it is an ego that's
[SPEAKER_03]: selling your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, you know, that may be,
I mean, depending on the brand,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe your brand is entirely egotistical
and all about yourself, but, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you're, if you're hurting the
brand or if you're hurting the reputation
[SPEAKER_03]: of a company, then, um, ego does not help
it become, uh, you know, re-ingratiated to
[SPEAKER_03]: the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think you made a really salient
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I mean, also from your perspective
is one of, of information or sort of being
[SPEAKER_01]: informed because you have this sort of,
um, you know, this cultivation experience
[SPEAKER_01]: here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To draw from and like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess, like, I'm, I guess I'm very,
I'm very hesitant to blame, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the individual for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do believe in, you know,
individual, like responsibility and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, you know, it's more like,
it's more like it comes from like a game
[SPEAKER_01]: theory perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than, you know, like, it's like the
buck stops here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I was taught, you know,
I, there was a pathway, we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: investigate this in this, um, talk,
but like, there was a time in my life
[SPEAKER_01]: where I wanted to join the U S army,
um, up till like middle of my teens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't actually end up doing that,
of course, but like I was taught,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had army instructors and things,
um, going to a military school and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, where, uh, you know,
you were supposed to take that personal
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like at the same time,
uh, you, you could be like the most
[SPEAKER_01]: rational person, you know, uh,
and like, you understand that if I,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I admit it to it and I'm in a system
that's not rational, then I can't act in
[SPEAKER_01]: the rational normal way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I feel like I'm going to be vulnerable
and I don't actually think I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: project like protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in an environment like that,
like a lot of people, then it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the ecosystem, look at the
cultivation system, um, um, it's all tied
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think it takes, uh,
yeah, I don't think it takes like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, a member of Mensa to see
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, uh, prior to cultivating,
I was a chef for around a decade and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, then just, you know, working in
hospitalities for a bit longer than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, people don't, you,
you have so much of the burden of
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibility upon your shoulders within
a setting like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because you are semi beholden to the
customer and their experience with what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're providing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, considering the cannabis is also
another product, just like, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: a nice, uh, you know, a nice dinner out at
a fancy restaurant is technically a
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you can immediately see who is
providing you that product right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and then in cannabis with through the
branding and stuff, and how people are
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to connect themselves to these
brands through social media and otherwise,
[SPEAKER_03]: you are directly connected to that end
product and the experience that the user
[SPEAKER_03]: has.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, one thing that, um, my partner
and I have even been talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: recently is like the set and setting of
different experiences and how those can
[SPEAKER_03]: change your perspective and your view of,
of something.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may not even have to do with,
uh, the product itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're experiencing like a product or
the nice dinner, you know, you could be in
[SPEAKER_03]: there in a bad mood and it could be the
best meal in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it still would be a shitty meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's so true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we, we, we do need to maybe take
a little bit more perspective of,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, how we are all experiencing these
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, especially being a little bit
more understanding because this is a place
where people have more to share with.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And plants do plant things plants,
have bugs that are attracted to them and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, maybe a little bit more humility and
openness, uh, in terms of telling people
[SPEAKER_03]: more about the process of cultivation and,
um, Even post processing, like post
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest processing and stuff will provide
people with a more, beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding so that, you know,
the cultivator is maybe a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: better understood and all the plights that
they face within trying to get this
[SPEAKER_03]: product to the end user.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like the solution is, you know,
it's like what you said about,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, with the consumer, what the person
who's going to receive the product end up
[SPEAKER_01]: getting is, you know, they just,
they don't really want to know all these
[SPEAKER_01]: details a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to get the thing and then
have the thing, um, which I get,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, but then like similar, but in like a
very similar way, if somebody,
[SPEAKER_01]: if like a cultivator has a problem,
you know, they don't want to like have to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn, they want the fish given to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to have to learn how to
fish, especially I don't have any time to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how to fish, um, in this particular
moment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, give me, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, but like the, but you know,
like a robust answer is always like
[SPEAKER_01]: superior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, it's like that saying,
like every, every problem has an answer
[SPEAKER_01]: that's simple and wrong or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I just think that like everyone is
really, I think an informed citizen's
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility to know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like, if you abscond from that
responsibility to like be informed,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I don't know how to help you with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beyond a, you know, that's beyond
my 10, but I think that like, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: like people, like I get why it's like kind
of a self-reinforcing vicious cycle where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people don't want to be open on
one end and other people have had to for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time, not been open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the strat for a long time in
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, it's very, and I think
you're also, I want to say that I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like your perspective on the market is,
is realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also respect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is more than a market product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's also an absolutely
valid perspective is also my perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like, obviously like the way that
most people acquire it is through a market
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, you know, people don't think
about like the bugs that are on their
[SPEAKER_01]: radishes or their lettuce or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, um, I, you know,
it's like being a client doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people are like putting me on
their gram being like, Hey everyone,
[SPEAKER_01]: today we had hashtag rice food,
a FIDS, and we've got Matt here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, and usually, and a lot of
times when the people bring me,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it's not actually that bad anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, um, I'm usually pleasantly surprised,
not always, but, um, it does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's kind of like with,
you know, digging in on farmers who are
[SPEAKER_01]: like just trying to feed their families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people and are actually pretty
decent people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, a minority of people or,
or, or some amount of people who do maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: things that they shouldn't, um,
and are able to get away with obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: have made people very skeptical about many
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like, you know, I can't,
I just can't knock most farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually really enjoy working in food
production and agriculture, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in non-cannabis crops, uh,
because they get a genuine fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I feel like, you know, it's like,
you know, did you eat today?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, think a farmer, you know,
I just feel like I'm enabling like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, like the civilization fundament
practically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that gives me a lot of,
uh, uh, it makes me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt best working in food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt the least fulfilled working,
I'm sad to say in ornamental crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's just going into base folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people buying flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of my generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also heard that a lot from these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we get younger people into
flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's my capitalistic conditioning
as well, but whenever I am planning out
[SPEAKER_03]: like a home garden or something,
everything I'm like, everything that's in
[SPEAKER_03]: there has to be working.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nothing's in there for free just
to look pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that everything's
doing something, whether it be providing,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, some sort of like Bain
properties to a pest or, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, whether that be like bug or
rodent or otherwise that is around that I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to keep away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if it's something just for the
pollinators to make sure that I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: good population of pollinators in the
area, but then everything else I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're, you're working for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to eat you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to make sure that you're doing the
things that I need you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's super valid though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, that's like a, a,
a SIM, uh, they call it like sin biotic
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new research term.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you will, it's sin bio synthetic
biology or sin eco synthetic ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it's like, I mean, it sounds like
it sounds really like extreme or weird or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, but really it's the same as
like having a fish tank or a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_01]: a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's biodome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's the same concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the terminator coming to
kill all life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, it's literally what's the most
holistic approach to the ecosystem I can
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also factoring the fact that
people use money to make things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then that's just a resource in and
of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even plants have to proportionally react
to pests with the resources that they work
[SPEAKER_01]: for by quenching photons in their
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the same thing all the way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does feel a little better,
um, to know that I am also then trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: provide this more holistic approach rather
than just saying, I'm, I am mono cropping
[SPEAKER_03]: corn and I'm going to dry some,
and I'm going to eat some fresh,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's all I'm growing because then I
only have to focus on one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's where we've gone wrong in
a lot of ways in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, maybe there is more
opportunity in the future for this,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, sin, uh, synthesized, uh, bio,
uh, approach that would allow for maybe,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, maybe even like something as,
as extreme as less ecological collapse for
[SPEAKER_03]: certain species or other otherwise,
just by helping maintain the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: they need to survive as well as what you
use to survive as a human.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or even like, or even like isolating
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's auto sometimes it's sort of
anathema to how people like to do those
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of, to have like an ecosystem
approach, but maybe in some ways it is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually better to, to be responsible and
like kind of keep things inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can still use like various
microbial consortia and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, predator insects and pollen and banker
plants and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe you like sort of internalize
some or all of those components so that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's less spread or, um, that,
you know, I just think that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that people of my generation,
um, have really pivoted, uh, at least for
[SPEAKER_01]: those who do care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess it's a lot more than the past,
but like people are pivoting towards
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are pivoting towards, um,
you know, just general better
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding to be informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel like there's more, more people
who could do that, but I do think that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are raising an alarm about things
that maybe should have even 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's endearing to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad to see that you seem to also
be such a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always good to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it feels like the communal
approach, uh, in the long run does create
[SPEAKER_03]: a more positive benefit for a greater
population than say an isolated approach
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're really just focusing on what
you need or what, what you can get the
[SPEAKER_03]: most out of something, um, that there's a
lot of privilege within isolation as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: that a lot of people don't have access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And community is required in a lot of ways
in order to make sure the, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: or ensure that the health and survival of,
of, uh, populations of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, you know, if, if, uh,
the end goal of this is all to either
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially make, make humans,
uh, you know, more happy, more
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable, more healthy, I don't know,
you know, more, uh, than looking at it
[SPEAKER_03]: through the communal lens rather than the
isolated lens does feel like a much better
[SPEAKER_03]: approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you've had, uh, you know,
not, not so much home grow experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you do help home growers all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have a lot of commercial
experience, both within, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial agriculture for, for food
production, for cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_03]: for, um, ornamentals, uh, maybe,
and, and feel free to take this in any
[SPEAKER_03]: direction that you want, but as an
integrated pest management specialist,
[SPEAKER_03]: where would you like to see changes within
the agricultural community, whether it be
[SPEAKER_03]: in cannabis, um, or outside of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if I had, if I was able to
direct that kind of thing at a huge level,
[SPEAKER_01]: top down, just be like king for a day,
we do this or these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be actually, um,
I think it would be like basically data
[SPEAKER_01]: driven, basically make a lot of things are
moving this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ag 4.0 fog computing using autonomous
vehicles, um, being able to not only
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregate a lot of data with sensor
imaging and other kinds of sensing
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, uh, but then taking that massive
amount of data, crunching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Analyzing it, using systems or make
predictions for you and then merge that
[SPEAKER_01]: with your own decision making essentially,
uh, what we see in research being called a
[SPEAKER_01]: cyber agricultural system, uh,
I think is really a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I think it's way, uh, I mean,
I think that it solves certain problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've actually find, um, really
disgusting in agriculture, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly being forced indentured servitude,
a, uh, basically millennia old tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since agriculture has existed,
I would say more or less, whether you did
[SPEAKER_01]: it to your own people or other people's
people, it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that could help with some
of that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at least it makes people use resources
a little bit more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that, and historically the
problem with doing things like this is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the technology is just aren't
democratized enough, uh, which is super
[SPEAKER_01]: understandable reason why they have been
adopted, um, um, really expensive and also
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not as like capable as they were in
like 10 years, 20 years before,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but you know, back when game boy was
new, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, but nowadays it's, I think a
different sort of tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that specifically the
subsidization of that data, like imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: if I've seen research coming out of China
actually, uh, that I've been kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: enamored with, um, but I understand why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they get to do the things they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm not an advocate for it,
but, um, when you have a government that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to direct and subsidize tons of
money towards something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get certain benefits out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a similar thing like we've
done in the U S and other countries could
[SPEAKER_01]: also adopt this, um, uh, subsidization of,
of regional data tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for example, for bud worms,
you know, knowing when is it that they
[SPEAKER_01]: emerge in your area?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the degree day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, intervals, this kind of data,
we don't have to memorize it as people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have systems that kind of figure
this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, push notifications, say, Hey,
go, go apply this today because these
[SPEAKER_03]: events just occurred a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you know that like, it's going to
like, you know, even like weather
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction that we have now is like having
an Oracle in your pocket, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so, and they're not actually getting
high off of volcanic fumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually predicting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that kind of stuff is what I
would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause then also we wouldn't have to
necessarily even rely on products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay for, um, if you subsidize
it in some way and every, everybody could
[SPEAKER_01]: like log into this data and get,
and then that data can talk with other AI
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of stuff and get that,
um, those sort of like, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnifying capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I think that it would do a lot to
help people go if there's, if they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: if their level of capability is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it brings them up a level,
all of the other stuff they have in their
[SPEAKER_01]: mind and their experience works
synergistically with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they won't get gobsmacked,
um, and blindsided by something new,
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially like that bio bio resistant
aphid that we just talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of stuff is what I'm excited
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it seems like it's more and more
tenable, more and more capable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm happy about that, but we'll see
if it actually gets implemented and if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually as good as I think it will
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the, the use of the
technologies that we do have access to in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to gather data, record data,
track data, and help create these,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, predictive maps, um, that allow you to
kind of, uh, control more tightly the
[SPEAKER_03]: different parameters of a growing
environment and react, uh, more quickly as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as more quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: More effectively to the different,
um, aspects of a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, you know, I've said it before and
I'm going to keep saying it, but it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and plants do plant things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't always react the way that you
want them to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but by providing, uh, more data over
time, you will have the ability to make
[SPEAKER_03]: more predictive models of how they should
react to specific stimuli.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is, um, especially I could see
within, in the pest management world,
[SPEAKER_03]: how that would be hugely beneficial
considering, I think, um, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_03]: it was you that said this or Suzanne
Wainwright Evans that said this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in poinsettias like the, you know,
the margin of error is a couple of pennies
[SPEAKER_03]: in order to make sure that that,
that is profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you have to apply some new
chemistry that costs, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a dollar more to apply and you need to
apply it a hundred days out of the year,
[SPEAKER_03]: then all of a sudden your entire crop is
no longer profitable and you can no longer
[SPEAKER_03]: sustain that business model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so something that allows you to then
be even more predictive about your needs
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as you can reduce, uh,
applicant, you know, how much of a
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical you're applying, uh, you're going
to be able to save money and all through
[SPEAKER_03]: the ability to, to track this data,
analyze it more effectively than a human
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting there, crop scouting and then
thinking, oh, you know, maybe 20% of these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants show a problem that's above the
economic threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should apply this, that it's a lot,
it's a lot to just do all that math in
[SPEAKER_03]: your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so I could see that that's a
great one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I use data analysis all the time,
but it's usually for environmental factors
[SPEAKER_03]: and substrate monitoring and things along
those lines, but they're hugely
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can reduce our overall irrigation
volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can reduce our fertilizer applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can reduce our CO2 applied,
which is another cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can reduce our lighting that's applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the correct, um, the correct timing,
which is an over, like, just an overhead
[SPEAKER_03]: reduction in cost and all these different
things where you can slowly bring down how
[SPEAKER_03]: much input you're actually putting in to
the same output.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I don't see how there's,
unless you have a massive team of human
[SPEAKER_03]: brains working to try and figure this out,
I don't see many other options other than
[SPEAKER_03]: turning to these, um, either predictive
models or, uh, like AI generative learning
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and trying to analyze all the data
that's inputted and create a more holistic
[SPEAKER_03]: view of what the potentials that that data
could cause within the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, I, I'm a huge fan of technology,
but, um, you know, I always think like,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it's, it's about who's using it
and how they're applying it rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: the technology itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes it can be applied
poorly, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then be misinterpreted and cause even
more damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, go watch the Terminator and,
and then we'll, we'll be on the same page,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just like you said earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, you know, that, that kind of
wraps up all the questions that I had for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, were there any other topics that we
didn't touch on that you wanted to bring
[SPEAKER_03]: up in our conversation today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we went over a lot of good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I'll, you know, you asked,
when you asked me to go and talk with you
[SPEAKER_01]: here, um, you know, you had mentioned
like, you know, home grow situations and
[SPEAKER_01]: things and plants you grow by yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had said that, you know,
maybe I don't have a whole lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: not as an experience, but like,
you know, cool stuff to talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will say this, I want to,
I want to touch in on that point at the
[SPEAKER_01]: very end here as a bonus for anyone who's
watched the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that, um, I have a really cool
plant that, uh, um, I'm very proud of
[SPEAKER_01]: having planted, which was a, it's called
lizard tail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm forgetting the binomial name,
the scientific name, uh, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: called fish mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've heard of this, if you type this
into a search, you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is a Southeast Asian plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually pretty invasive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be honest here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so keep in a pot, but, um,
it's, uh, it tastes like fish,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves tastes like fish and,
uh, grows really well and it loves to be
[SPEAKER_01]: watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, you can put in your
stir fry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's slept on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've never heard of this,
um, it's really easy to take care of and I
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, uh, it'd probably be good in
like Thai curry or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, um, egg fried rice or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as a little bit of a, I still like to
cook even though I don't really do it that
[SPEAKER_03]: much, uh, you know, professionally
anymore, but, um, finding those little
[SPEAKER_03]: herbs and stuff and, and, and,
you know, finding the dish that they,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, pair well with is always really fun
and new flavor experiences are always fun
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fish mint people go look it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a couple of questions that I
usually like to ask all of my guests and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, considering that you are a cannabis
user, I feel like you will still have some
[SPEAKER_03]: good answers for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is your favorite strain of all
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very strained agnostic because people,
you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say that this is that and other
people say you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even know if I, I don't even
know if what I've had is what I've had,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe somebody wants to dispute with me
about whether or not I had what I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: had or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, one of my favorite strains
I've ever had, one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars is, um, uh, death breath that
Brandon rest, um, had, had bread and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, hogs breath also, which is,
um, associated, I'm told with San Diego in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to meet some of the people who
create either created it or continue its
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage, um, here in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed them both because they were
really gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I felt like they were very,
they had a lot of the, uh, sort of peppery
[SPEAKER_01]: turpiness, um, kind of like, like a dark
flavor, you know, kind of like not fruity,
[SPEAKER_01]: not sweet, but kind of like gassy and,
um, piney and a peppery and kind of these
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of like savory more so kind of
aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really cool when
they're really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I enjoy that flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not enough of a snob to say that I'll
turn down something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I'll, I don't think I've
reached that point, but, uh, I did quite
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the history was kind of nice too,
to boot.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if you can have that sort of,
uh, enhanced experience of not just
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily at being, oh, some weed in the
bag, but you're like, I know the guy that
[SPEAKER_03]: grew this, that put the time and effort
into continuing the lineage of this and he
[SPEAKER_03]: chose it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: For these purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm here having a little bit of
flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like going to wine country and
going on a wine tasting experience and
[SPEAKER_03]: having the, the winemaker right there with
you talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a unique, and I feel like
those, uh, those experiences can be fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: well cherished for, uh, their,
their uniqueness and, um, sort of what,
[SPEAKER_03]: what might be referred to as, uh,
authenticity within that specific
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, uh, you know, we didn't get into
it, but I know that you are a member of
[SPEAKER_03]: the, uh, is it the rare fruit,
uh, tree society in Southern California?
[SPEAKER_01]: San Diego chapter of the rare fruit
growers association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So considering that you don't personally
grow a lot of cannabis, um, do you have,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this, you know, this could totally be
cannabis if you, if you want to go that
[SPEAKER_03]: route.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, feel free to go outside of the
realm of cannabis for this question,
[SPEAKER_03]: but do you have a favorite plant breeder
of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, but you know, I'm kind of
forgetting their name, unfortunately when
[SPEAKER_01]: put to the test, but there's two people,
um, that come to my mind, both of which
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now forgetting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was a really, really famous,
um, agriculturalist in China who passed
[SPEAKER_01]: away last year or perhaps a year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he was very famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: People made a big uproar about his
passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think he's very famous for bringing
specifically like different types of rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I think wheat too, I want to say,
uh, making it very like, um, adapted to
[SPEAKER_01]: the various regions in the people's
Republic of China.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, especially if you know
their history, um, you know, not to make
[SPEAKER_01]: light of it, but there are several famines
in Chinese history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so doing the opposite of that is
definitely a boon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then another gentleman who I'm
also forgetting, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's the, he's actually the person who
started up the, uh, rare fruit growers
[SPEAKER_01]: association.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the rare fruits that he's
really, he's really famous for is,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, there's several apples that I
think he kept around even though they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of dedicates a lot of time and
dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't imagine somebody doing it,
especially in this day and age,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's just who has the time resources,
ability, know-how, um, and care to be
[SPEAKER_01]: quite honest, the, the actually personal
initiative to, to do it, even though how
[SPEAKER_01]: many people are really going to have this
like black cherry cultivar of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, apple that with the red
flesh or whatever in a black rind,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that's an, and, and the same
sort of beauty of that, uh, impermanence
[SPEAKER_01]: is also what I find.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a guy who grew cannabis here in
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made this cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called orange Tang, like Tang,
the orange drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's gone now, uh, no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, when I smoked it,
it really tasted like orange juice and not
[SPEAKER_01]: like other sorts of, um, Citric flavors,
but really did taste like orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I thought that was really novel
and cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure other ones are like that,
but I love, um, that I got to meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of interesting that it's no
longer available anymore.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do really think that the individuals who
put the effort into either, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, preserving a specific cultivar
or creating novel cultivars for the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it makes me think of that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't remember his name either,
but he was, I believe out of Pasadena,
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did all the different stone fruit
crosses, like the, um, the, like the plum
[SPEAKER_03]: and the apricot cross and the apricot and
the, uh, you know, the, um, I think like
[SPEAKER_03]: you got like pluots and apriums and,
um, all the different types of peaches and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that were, that were developed in
that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he developed like hundreds of
these different varietals that are even
[SPEAKER_03]: still grown today, but to have that
dedication and to creating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun novel food stuffs is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The loquat tree I had mentioned earlier is
the big Jim cultivar and big Jim,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think was one of those people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's like really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, basically I think he might've been the
person who started the rear fruit growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I think about it, or he was associated
with it at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now tons of people have it in
their backyards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that's parallels really
well with the community that we think of
[SPEAKER_01]: release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's something that I think of
when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you, um, you know,
searching out those impressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they often don't get spoken by me
or other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually have to keep it empirical,
but it doesn't mean that I have no heart
[SPEAKER_01]: or that I don't have a, um, more whim and
foppery approach to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're a fan of Pokemon,
so that says something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play the games anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do find that they're a little bit rigid
and game freak could probably stand to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more innovative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know what we had together,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, I just have one last question
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what is your most memorable cannabis
related experience or just a good
[SPEAKER_03]: memorable cannabis related experience
doesn't necessarily mean that it needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: be the apex of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if I go back to when I was
helping my friends in the high deserts of
[SPEAKER_01]: Lone Pine, California, and, um,
so I'm in my early twenties, early to mid
[SPEAKER_01]: twenties, um, uh, I'd gotten back from
China and it was just this sort of beauty
[SPEAKER_01]: that I talked to before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like cold, but it's also hot from the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like February winter time kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm smoking a joint and like,
at that point I had become more,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started smoking joints more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I just been really getting
into my work and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing to just kind of like
walk down this like pathway of like scrub
[SPEAKER_01]: land and like a ravine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always like oak trees creating
some shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, there was like a natural
beauty, uh, that I enjoyed in that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I, and I remember the sky was
quite, you know, Azure and blue,
[SPEAKER_01]: deep blue, um, no clouds in the sky and
also, you know, snow everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of surprising to be in a desert
with snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was kind of surreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think something about like the mind
space that it was in, um, not only
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking, but also, um, you know,
just hanging out with my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just a really great memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does sound really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I know I forgot too,
about the snow from when you had talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about that earlier, because not only are
you in the desert where it's really dry
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of, uh, vast and expansive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not a lot of things to create
noise, but then you also have this
[SPEAKER_03]: covering of snow, which just deafens
everything else even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, you know, I'm thinking of
something like that, where it would
[SPEAKER_03]: probably be very quiet if you didn't move.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if everyone else was being very quiet,
it would almost be deafening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get some law, some, uh, fast moving
winds as well during the, during certain
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, but you would get sort of
wind that would kick up sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like, yeah, it's like,
it's like very peaceful and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to go up to opening trout sometime
in the next year or two, where they had
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this events, you can go and fish
and.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friends often come during that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we'll do that this year.
We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Matt, again, thank you so much for
joining me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that this is a little bit of an
unorthodox episode for our listeners,
[SPEAKER_03]: where we usually have people on that are,
um, either dedicated home growers or
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial cultivators themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do believe that it, uh, by providing
these different, um, perspectives of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cultivators, of cannabis
cultivation, um, yours being through that
[SPEAKER_03]: of, uh, someone who loves bugs,
that it is, it provides a more holistic
[SPEAKER_03]: approach and people can, I believe
appreciate the different aspects of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cultivation more deeply when we
give them the ability to see it through
[SPEAKER_03]: other people's eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, really appreciate you being here
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think that people are going
to enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to our mutual success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
