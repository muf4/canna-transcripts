[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Gabby Staten Island and I'm here
with my dog Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hi Ray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray!
[SPEAKER_01]: She's super interested in the smells here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I wanted to do another one of my
dog walking videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dog walking videos have been well
received.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last one was when I announced the Gabby
Staten Island Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, like I was saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to make another video for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today the video is not as pleasant as
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not announcing a new clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not talking about an upcoming podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically want to talk to you about a beef
I have with somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody pretty high profile that is well
loved in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he's well loved because of the
genetics that he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people really don't know who this guy
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who he is for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today I decided I'm gonna I'm gonna
tell you what my beef is with this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, what I want to say is
when I made this podcast, I made it
[SPEAKER_01]: originally to respond to videos that other
people made about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was stuff that not so dog was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just he wasn't saying things
the way I feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was kind of quoting me or
telling people how I feel but he wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually telling it accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made a response video to not so dog
who I love dearly and you should check out
[SPEAKER_01]: his podcast, the not so dog and cry baby
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so I made this channel first to
document my weed story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really important to do because
to be honest, to be honest, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: forgetting some details.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to be clear, there's a
difference between forgetting something
[SPEAKER_01]: and remembering things differently,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, when I made this channel,
I made it to respond to people's videos,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly not so dog cry baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I really like those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommend you check out their
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made my own channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a response to those guys and it
caught on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like right away I was getting a
good response from people and I decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep doing it and really appreciate
the support I've been getting from all you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the same time that I made this
podcast, I also did something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was I contacted my grandmother
and I told her that I wanted to document
[SPEAKER_01]: my family story because I have an eight
year old daughter that unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: my mom died.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she never got to meet her mom and her
grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never knew my great grandparents on
my mom's side or either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I was talking to my grandma and I
told her that I wanted to document my
[SPEAKER_01]: family story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make like a podcast, but it would be
private.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole idea is to document my story
for future generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously my story is way beyond
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was, you know, pretty touched by
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, she said she wanted to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things she said was she
didn't want to tell the whole story
[SPEAKER_01]: because some of the stuff with her
parents, it was sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I reminded her that on my dad's side,
everyone was wiped out in the Holocaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't not tell the stories just
because they're not happy stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, she agreed and she's
currently writing down the story every day
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can record stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, she's 98 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd appreciate it if you all sent her your
best wishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty lucky to still have her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this beef and it's with VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you guys to know what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's about time that I let the
world know that me and VA skunk were not
[SPEAKER_01]: cool because everybody seems to think like
we're best friends because we did this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast together and we have a history,
but we don't like each other at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honestly, I can say I don't
respect this guy at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I've been trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying, but he makes it really
fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't make it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to tell you what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have it can be judged in
the court of public opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing I want to say is I
invited him to do the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invited him to do it and we could have
heavy days moderate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we could both tell our story
publicly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest with you, he was a
chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he'll say, oh, I just don't want
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got no time for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, I was going to do it on the
heavy days podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put that in the text message because
it's not like I'm looking for viral views.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just think it's about time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That people know like this is what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I think of this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he refused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to tell my story myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if he wants to clap back on
another podcast or do his own thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because like I'm prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't think he has any reason to
act and treat me the way he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I can tell my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he wants to tell his story,
he can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like I said, it can be judged in
the court of public opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm going to briefly talk
about the beginning of our story because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been told before on the podcast with
heavy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I suggested that heavy days
moderate was because I didn't want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: be like one of the team on my podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And heavy days is a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: A VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured like he can't say that we're
biased when we have his friend do the
[SPEAKER_01]: moderating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course he refused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way the story begins is met VA
skunk in Golden Gate Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold him weed, which he loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's how it all began.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sold him weed in the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the panhandle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sold my weed when I was first
living in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I didn't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to the point where I lived in Sonoma
County and I drove down to Golden Gate
[SPEAKER_01]: Park to sell my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that shows like what desperate
times it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like it's one thing when Jerry was
in town, then it was super easy to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when the dead were on the
road, it wasn't so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I met him in Golden Gate Park
and he sold my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we became friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to go see Jerry at the Warfield
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we had lots of good times
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like lots of good memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I told him, you know,
because he was traveling with the dead
[SPEAKER_01]: still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was basically just based in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when Jerry came to town, I would see
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wasn't like traveling the whole
country to see him like Jason was at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually the reason why I came to
California was so I didn't have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides, I had a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't just like go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you got plants,
they kind of like, they keep you home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I told Jason that, you know,
when the time came that he wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: settle down and get a place that I would
teach him how to grow and I'd give him
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when Jerry died,
sadly, in 1995, that's what happened.
Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason got a place and I gave him plants
and I helped him grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't disagree about it being
the most high quality in the world I've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the guy puts his, yeah,
he grows incredible weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always has.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is the man who taught me
everything I need to know on day one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuts and all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, I was so like elated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe it was like my lucky
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you guys will tolerate this
because it's off the cuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too scripted, although I have some
notes that I'm going to talk about later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was like 1992 or 1993.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason introduced me to one of his friends
from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't mention him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a name out of respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: He introduced me to this guy and I showed
him some weed that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he showed me some weed that
he had and we decided to make a trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Jason introduced us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I had a clone that I
eventually traded him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I got the super skunk,
the not the sensei seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this guy made an F2 or an F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I what happened was I drove in my
car across country with a couple of cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: of my strain called the Francine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I named all my strains girl's names.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, I drove Francine across
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was in New York City and we
made a trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him Francine and he actually gave
me a couple of clones of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I took those plants up to
Massachusetts and I traded Greg for the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog, the one that we now call the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Greg got this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe later on that plant's been
called the mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, reality that thing came
from Virginia and threw my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I drove those clones across country
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I tell the story and I'll
be briefed that when I drove it across
[SPEAKER_01]: country, I would keep it in a Dixie like a
Burger King cup or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like one of those big soda cups
and it had a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody drove by, I could just,
you know, quickly cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I had to go into a gas station or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, Ray?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so drove that across country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably took me like five days because I
was driving by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ray really wants to say hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so I drove it across country.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 92 or 93.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason wasn't even growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I have these plants now for
years before Jason starts growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Jerry died in August of 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, took a minute till Jason
came to California, got a place and
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure exactly when it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I had those plants for
years before he ever did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got his place and we were partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think I made a deal with Jason
that, you know, the only thing I asked was
[SPEAKER_01]: that he sell me the weed, you know,
which I don't think he had a problem with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, my point is, is that I gave
Jason the skunk and the Chem 91,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I think 1995, late 95,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I taught him how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taught him everything that I knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I did settle down, he brought the
super skunk back over to the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I lived in Sonoma County, same spot he
was in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he stood up on his offer and he showed
me what he knew and he knew quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he'd been growing weed for a
while and also brought the Chem 91 over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course he was like, I was like,
what about the Chem dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, oh, you don't want to mess
with that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, that's the best one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mess with that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, well, you know, it's really hard
to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to break your heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a thick New York accent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I can deal with a little
heartbreak, you know, with the best weed
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, it doesn't root,
you know, you can't smoke in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you're not going to convince
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're going to, let's get that one
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got, you know, good success,
beginner's luck rooting it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone says, you don't want this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you holding out?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's the best, but she's hard to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, bring her on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he kept his word though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those years later, I mean,
that's rare too, in this business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, word was different back
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say a bit, you know, like,
well, quite a bit actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was your bond and it would have been
odd not to, and we all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, getting back to the story,
um, Jason grew those plants and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, he held the Chem 91 at least
for 30 years, you know, so far,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he's going to keep it a lot
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he should be praised for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like for some reason,
I think he doesn't think I give him credit
[SPEAKER_01]: for it, which I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just explain later, you know,
what my issues are with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't know anyone that's
holding onto strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's held on to some strains that long,
but it's a really fucking long time to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold on to a cannabis strain without using
tissue culture and definitely deserves
[SPEAKER_01]: props for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, anyway, so I'm going to jump forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: In time, cause you know, most people know
that part of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people know about, I shouldn't say
most people, but a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's other podcasts where they talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I don't need to, to go in all
that too deeply, but what I want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to you about is how I lost the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, I'm going to start
telling you about the beef that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Jason, let me tell you how the story
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how Jason and I stopped talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is about 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, agreed to do a breeding
project together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave him a bunch of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him seeds that I purchased in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, then I also gave him some clones
that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him the cherry pie and I gave him
the master Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, both of those clones were highly
desired at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe he still has both of those
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he actually told me that he still
has these seed packs, which really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: bummed me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I know my story is rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little high on sour diesel and I'm a
little upset about this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so anyway, we're supposed to do this
breeding project together and I give him
[SPEAKER_01]: this genetics and the month goes by,
which isn't really that long, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the next time I see him,
you know, he comes to my store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a grow shop in Santa Rosa,
the garden spout.
[SPEAKER_01]: He comes to my store and you know,
the way he tells the story and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to dispute this because,
you know, I was going through some shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he said like he came to the store and
I was in a bad mood and yeah, like totally
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a bad mood and I was a little
short with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I don't think I like raised my
voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just might've been like,
I might've been rude and I'm not,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, defending it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I'm actually, if I was
rude, I'm sorry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Jason, I say, you know,
what's going on with that breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I have no intention of doing that
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that fucking super pissed me off and I
was already in a bad mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we got into an argument about it
and we didn't speak for over 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to point out, I had purchased a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a small light depth greenhouse that
had a motor on it that it would cover the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't have to drag a tarp and I
gave him all these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never returned them greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was like 2,500 bucks
wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I owned the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like a $5,000 greenhouse
and never gave me my seeds back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the clones at the time,
I don't know that I needed those back,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the seed packs were from Holland that
I had been saving for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, one of them that I remember was,
um, from TH seeds, it was the sage and
[SPEAKER_01]: sour, which I really want those seeds even
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, later on you'll hear that he
actually still has those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyway, I got pissed off and you
know, he got upset, you know, because
[SPEAKER_01]: words were said and we didn't talk for 15
years with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to light another joint
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I finally saw him 15 years later,
I realized or to myself, I said that our
[SPEAKER_01]: friendship mattered more to me than,
you know, the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I thought he did the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out he never even did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like, I felt like he ripped me
off, took my genetics, did a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project and never gave me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only found out like, a short amount
of time ago that he just never did
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, but still he had my greenhouse,
didn't return it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so 15 years, I'm thinking this
guy, he like stole my shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: made, did a breeding project, didn't give
me anything and took my greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't give me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, like I said, Jason might have a
different side of the story, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, he's not here today to tell it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom line is we didn't talk for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I saw him, I was like,
I thought to myself, Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy's an important part of my
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite everything that happened,
I still have love for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him that and, um, I wanted us
to, you know, be friends again and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, he agreed and um, eventually,
well, you know, we talked about like us
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a collaboration together in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hooked me up with Breeders Direct,
who Michelle from Breeders Direct is his
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been a really good thing for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I've been selling clones on
the Breeders Direct website and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we talk about doing another
collaboration because I think that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: the market wants, that the market would
really appreciate, you know, me and him
[SPEAKER_01]: working together again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then me and my buddy Gabby have some
good news too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, uh, we decided to, uh, team up and
start working on providing some genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: focusing on clones and we're going to do
some seed collaborations together.
[SPEAKER_04]: With, uh, some breeding projects,
chem dog heavy, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, you know, I'm super fucking
excited about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super excited to be working with
Gabby.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had literally 30 solid years of
knowing each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in February this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We met in February of 1993, all those
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just, I mean, we talk a lot more
now and it just feels good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'm fucking excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my friend Gabby's excited and you
know, ready to just get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going on and kind of, you know,
put the, put the old school and the chem
[SPEAKER_04]: and the chem kind of stuff to gas back in
what's available out there for folks,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they're definitely hungry for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This collab that sounds really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did this first come into life?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when did the wheels start
turning on that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: We planned this all up 30 years ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Gabby, he's, you know,
uh, he owned a chain of hot, not a chain,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, you know, several hydro stores for
awhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that petered out and went,
went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he's, uh, selling clones, you know,
selling genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we, we, we definitely worked
together on that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have a few collaborations
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's still fully involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, some of us are lifers, you know,
this is where it's at, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we talked about it and,
you know, he agreed that it was a good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave him a whole bunch of genetics
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did, he did breed with these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me that he's gotten seeds from
these genetics already.
[SPEAKER_01]: He later on told me that he thought most
of the genetics were garbage, but he's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, except for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his Michelle, his girlfriend
says, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one was really nice too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I know the strains that I gave
him, you know, they were, they were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one that I really liked the deep
end butter and he didn't like it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it wanted to go into flower real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it would just flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that's a problem when you
have a hard time getting a plant to veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grew them under 24 hours light,
they would veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I grew them under 18 hours light,
they would flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about this plant is it would
finish in six weeks and produce beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: purple buds, even when it's hot and had a
loud turf profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was an excellent candidate
for breeding, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only one that he could say,
Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I'm not going to breed with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones were fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bred with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell you guys something that
happened with me and Jason and breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: direct that when this happened,
it was kind of like our friendship took a
[SPEAKER_01]: turn for the worst and never got better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made a mistake and I'm going to
be honest with you guys about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was already honest with them like
immediately after the mistake was made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't think that it's the
type of thing that the reaction should
[SPEAKER_01]: have been what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to let you know and we'll
let the court of public opinion decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm selling clones on the breeders
direct website and I'm talking to the
[SPEAKER_01]: clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like people will message me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody purchased clones from Jason and
you know, he was worried about his order.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was taken a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest with you, the guy was like
very impatient, but Jason wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: responding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I responded to because he messaged
me directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I responded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Hey, I'll help you take care
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did, you know, Michelle and Jason
responded and he eventually got his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I became friends with this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, you know, a lot of people that
message me on Instagram, we become
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly, you know, because that's what I
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I had sold them a bunch of
clones through breeders direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything always went through breeders
direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought like, I don't know,
at least eight different strains off of
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every purchase goes through breeders
direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he asked me if I could get other
genetics and I was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get them, but I can't get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't have them and I have to buy a
flat and get my dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, he wanted these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew another nursery that had them and I
actually wanted these genetics to sell on
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made a deal with him outside of
breeders direct and the deal was that he
[SPEAKER_01]: pays for the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he pays for the flat and that I would
send them a few clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he'd have the genetic and I
didn't have the genetic and I could sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest, you know, through breeders
direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made the deal with, to do that
with him for like three strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he like immediately paid me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he sent me the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't even gotten the clones yet,
you know, might've been like a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days later that I spoke with Jason about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, I was like, Hey,
this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took this guy's money and you know,
for these clones, which I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: from this nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to keep the rest and
sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I said, I'm not making any money on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's literally paying for the flats,
but you know, I just wanted to be open
[SPEAKER_01]: with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think that I, you know,
owe you something, I'm happy to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: the commission, even though I'm not making
money on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason was like, well, you know,
you should have spoken to Michelle first.
[SPEAKER_01]: She probably would have given you the
money for the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let's talk to her about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I should make this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't allowed to speak to Michelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Jason had this thing where I had to
only communicate via email with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was allowed to speak to him on the
phone, but I wasn't allowed to speak to
[SPEAKER_01]: her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to send this email and in the
email I said, Hey Michelle, and I could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually look it up, but I'm paraphrasing
said, Hey Michelle, you know, hope you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to let you know that I did
something and I want you to know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke to Jason about this and I,
you know, let him know that I purchased
[SPEAKER_01]: these clones with money that I got from X
and you know, they were pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest with you, I think I
should have spoken to her about it first,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if I was trying to be sneaky,
I wouldn't have told her about it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, out of my own volition,
you know, before the clones hadn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: been shipped yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even told them, I said, I can send the
money back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I told them what I had done
because I realized like, Hey, I should
[SPEAKER_01]: have talked to them first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, they were pissed about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, Jason didn't talk to me at
all via phone or text message for over six
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, it was longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was so pissed that I did this because
he said that when I, and it's in an email,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, it's not like he said,
she said, like you can read the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that I threw him under the bus
and that I made it sound like he knew what
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing, but he didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him because I would speak to
him on the phone and I wouldn't speak to
[SPEAKER_01]: Michelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was never making it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he knew what I was doing and he was
cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, he knew what I did and I
talked to him about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that like forever changed my
relationship with Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't communicate with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he did, it was really short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, do I think I made a mistake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to make it right, you know,
and you know, like I said, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty clear that I didn't have an
intention of stealing clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jason doesn't talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He won't respond to my messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ask him for a meeting after meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He won't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't take my calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't respond to my text messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm getting frustrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, one of the big reasons why
I'm frustrated is because I don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I lost everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I not only don't have the chem dog,
but I don't have any of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost some in unfortunate events.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole house burned down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell the cardboard box story
about the skunk in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I lost all my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I've been wondering wanting
the chem dog back, but I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling to ask Jason for it because
he's so difficult and honestly so tight
[SPEAKER_01]: with that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually he's ignoring my text
messages and I've already given him a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of genetics for a collaboration
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's informed me that he's bred with
them already, that he's gotten seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me he was going to send me some
like over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we had an agreement to do a
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And proof of that is if you go on the
heavy days podcast that I did with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked that we're doing a
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we, we actually announced that we
intend on doing work together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then me and me and me and my buddy
Gabby have some good news too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're we decided to team up and start
working on providing some genetics focused
[SPEAKER_04]: on clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to do some seed
collaborations together with some breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: projects, chem dog heavy, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, you know, I'm super fucking
excited about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super excited to be working with
Gabby.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had literally 30 solid years of
knowing each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: As of February this year, we met in
February of 1993, all those years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just, I mean, we talk a lot more
now and it just feels good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'm fucking excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my friend Gabby's excited and,
you know, ready to just get it going on
[SPEAKER_04]: and kind of, you know, put the,
put the old school and the chem,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the chem kind of stuff, the gas back
and what's available out there for folks,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they're definitely hungry for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This collab, that sounds really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did this first come into life?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when did the wheels start
turning on that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never told me that he doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he says, yeah, like we
don't have a collaboration agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, can I get some of those
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave you the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ray sees I'm upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants to make me feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I gave you these genetics,
you bred with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you give me some seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, we don't have a collaboration
agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say, okay, how about the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get a cut of the chem dog?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, we don't have a
collaboration agreement, which wasn't the
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottom line is like, he brags on podcasts
about how he kept the strain for 30 years
[SPEAKER_01]: and that he's given it back to so many
people, but he's never given it to me
[SPEAKER_01]: ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember and I'm sure he'll
correct me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't remember him giving me a
single clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like I just recently,
you know, in the last few years,
[SPEAKER_01]: gave him a whole bunch of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like six or seven different
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's never offered to give me a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I showed interest in a plant,
I was like, oh man, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd think he'd be like, oh, you want
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so he's never given me a single
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I asked him for the chem dog,
he just dodges me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't respond, you know,
like we don't like communicate very much
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll drop him another message and ask
him about the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know, I'm going to do a breeding
project that really would like to include
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem dog, you know, and he either
ghosts me or says, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can have a meeting, but it'll have to
be on my schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Hey, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's schedule a meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me when's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it'll be like, okay, how about
tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tomorrow comes along and I message him
like, Hey, can we have a meeting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he freaks out because he's too busy
and can't do it or really doesn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he doesn't want to talk to me about
giving me the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so literally it's been like six or
seven months that I've been periodically
[SPEAKER_01]: asking him when I can get a cut of the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he doesn't want to give it
to me in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know he recorded it a while ago,
but, um, the first podcast of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: episode comes out and, you know,
he talks about me and he talks about how
[SPEAKER_01]: he's given all these people the chem dog
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which by the way, he lost it too,
and had it given back to him, but he,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, only for a couple of weeks,
he lost it, but you know, still he lost
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Ben from IC collective gave
it back to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't for Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog wouldn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not chem dog, uh, Jason VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyway, um, he doesn't want to give
me the chem dog back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep messaging him about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't want to give it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few weeks ago, the clone,
he decides to release a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: He puts it up for sale and I'm like,
I'm just like in shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been asking him for a cut,
you know, for six, seven months,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't want to give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he just puts it on sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I put an order in for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I sent him a text message with a
screenshot of my order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Hey, I guess I gotta,
you know, pay 500 bucks to get the chem
[SPEAKER_01]: dog back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he never processes my order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's like a couple of days
later, I'm like on the phone with a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's calling me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take the call and I'm like,
Hey, I'm surprised to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he makes it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why would I be surprised to hear
from him?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're like, I never talked to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, been super pissed at me
over something that I think is seriously
[SPEAKER_01]: blown out of proportion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, nonetheless, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls me up and I say, yeah,
I ordered that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, I'm just going to send it
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm like just so happy at this
point, because I'm like, I'm finally going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the chem dog back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason's finally going to give me the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we start talking about some
personal problems he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: His private business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I will say is that I talked to
him for eight hours over the course of a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days, like trying to like,
help him and be a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that time, like, we didn't really
talk about the chem dog, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like at the end of the first conversation
after like six hours, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's like, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Hey, wait, you know,
can we just talk about the chem dog for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I was trying to be a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, okay, you know,
I'll get you the clone, but I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: you to sell it for three to four months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you sell it, I want you to agree
to sell it for the same price as me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I was a bit taken aback
by this because like, for him to put
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions on me, I felt would be,
it's kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, he's selling the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, I gave him the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I gave it to him, I asked him to
not give it to anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm no longer upset about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually glad that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's why a bunch of
good genetics were made, but he's asking
[SPEAKER_01]: me to agree to not sell it and to,
and to charge a certain price for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I gave it to him, he didn't
follow his agreement, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is he's selling it to the
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I asked him, I said, Hey,
you know, when you sell it to these
[SPEAKER_01]: people, do they have any agreement to not
sell it or to sell it for a certain price?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, no, cause I'm selling it to
the public, but you're my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I should be able to ask you
to not be my competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while I thought it was completely
wrong for him to do that, I, I agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't planning on selling it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really wanted it for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised that you're selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just wanted it to breed with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next day or maybe a couple of
days later, he flew from Montana to LA and
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe he fulfilled all the orders that
were taken for the chem dog, but he didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: shit me much, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he had a really busy week.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's off to Barcelona, you know,
the end of this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I didn't make a big deal about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just figured, all right,
just going to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but, you know, it's fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really just bothers me that
he, like knowing that he shipped it to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people, but like he didn't send me
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after I agreed to, um, abide by his
terms, which I think were over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not next thing that happens is
Instagram fucking trolls me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I'm already upset at Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the top of my feed on Instagram
comes a post from 2017 from the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, this is VA skunk's first garden
and he's grown a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The video, the pictures on the podcast
were from Jason's first garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I completely help him set up,
gave him the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I comment on the post.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, I gave him all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows that I gave him the chem
91, but probably few people know that I
[SPEAKER_01]: gave him the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he's said that stat nine,
which is what he called me, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so me saying that I gave him that
isn't like a jab on him or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but I get a response and I'm reading
it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the super skunk LOL.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wish we had that one still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It died in a hot cardboard box in front of
your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the worst things ever happened in
modern cannabis, kind of a bad memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I send him a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't read you that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, buddy, I feel like you just called
me out publicly on Instagram for killing
[SPEAKER_01]: the VA skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I gave you those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not me calling you out or publicly
saying anything negative about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want us to be friends and work shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want you to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I just want you to be real and let
you know when I see these posts,
[SPEAKER_01]: it triggers me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been upsetting me because I've been
doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting ready to flower the red grape
Lebanese and Cali mist I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would have liked to cross it with a
dog, but I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shipped it out to others this week,
but not to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even tried to order it from you because
I really need it and it stings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just being real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not going to be able to breed
with it this round and who knows when I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be flowering these males again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason's reply is I'm sorry you feel that
way, but that's my story to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: LOL.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I went on Instagram today to
tell that story, but you prompted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't speak for marketing purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yours or my own, but I have tons of story.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bucket full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say, I'm getting it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his response, and this is on
Instagram, says, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll believe it when I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's true, I can't wait to get my
cut back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just kind of fucking triggers me even
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two reasons for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, why is it his cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he hooked me up with somebody and
then I did a trade with them and drove
[SPEAKER_01]: across country and somehow it's his cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's talking about the skunk,
by the way, which I grew for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it for over two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe three years before he ever had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had it till we both lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why he didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe because he just had a flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's like, bro, why are you
calling me out on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not calling you out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just posted that I gave you
something which you've publicly said a
[SPEAKER_01]: million times that I gave to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a sip of water and light up my joint
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, we start sending messages to
each other and it's a super long text
[SPEAKER_01]: thread and I'm not going to read it at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what I will say is anything that
I leave out, if Jason wants to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: it or post it, I'm fine with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because I'm only leaving things out
that I just feel are redundant and
[SPEAKER_01]: excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it's just not necessary to
make the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's some of the messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gabby, the constant questioning me is
getting old very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's far too time consuming and seems out
of touch with what's actually happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem traumatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: From I assume your home life, you seem
very defensive and honestly too easily
[SPEAKER_01]: triggered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becoming clear that you are looking
for a sparring partner outside of your
[SPEAKER_01]: home, maybe to take out the frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're feeling with the treatment
you're receiving at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comment is so fucking out of line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I'm not going to talk about the
shit, like the private shit that he said
[SPEAKER_01]: to me about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, this is what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when he throws that out of left
field, like we're talking about something
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and then he feels like he's got to say
that it's just he's just being an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just being an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Says, if I feel like responding to a
comment you place on a post from 2017
[SPEAKER_01]: about pictures from my garden,
then I'll do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel slighted by that, then that's
something you need to address personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a comment, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: How your feelings got entangled in a
comment is beyond my understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That story is part of cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been told a dozen times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see your text about about when you
neglected that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never get over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never even said you were sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by reading the text, it doesn't sound
like you even feel that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hurtful in ways I'm not sure you
even understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let's talk about how a comment
triggered you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you never considered that
making a comment on pictures I took of the
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk might open up a bad memory
that absolutely involves you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe you should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you really are wrapped up in your
own movie so that you can't see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me respond to that by saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did lose this clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I had a problem at home that I was
renting and the landlord had to come to
[SPEAKER_01]: fix an outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to have an electrician come
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got like, you know, the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put this plant in a cardboard box
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got fried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I regret it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not to Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, also, Jason makes it out like I was
the only person on the universe that had
[SPEAKER_01]: this clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about his friends in Virginia?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Greg that I gave it to?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I gave it to Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, maybe he only had flowering
rooms, but, you know, I wasn't the only
[SPEAKER_01]: person that had this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't feel I owe Jason an
apology because I killed one of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm happy to talk about it,
but like, the way he was talking about it
[SPEAKER_01]: is different if I tell the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he tells the story, he could be like,
yeah, that was an unfortunate demise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, he calls me out like I'm a
fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether I am or not,
like him calling me one publicly like that
[SPEAKER_01]: was just it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it wasn't your story to tell,
as you said, it was you talking shit about
[SPEAKER_01]: me publicly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason was getting a cut of all my sales
through Breeders Direct and him trolling
[SPEAKER_01]: me online like this and keeping the dog
from me for over six months.
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I feel about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't be giving him a commission on
my sales that I do through Breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: Direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I sent Michelle a
message privately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent it directly to her, which is
something that I'm not allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason only wanted me to communicate with
Michelle, like in a group email,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in an email message that I.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I see him in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the type of controlling person
that he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like that's a conversation that you
should have one on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also felt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fine to do it, you know,
it's all there in writing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing weird about it anyway,
so this is where it all comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proof is by what he says here,
says he says I wasn't going to send that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then Michelle told me that you didn't
want to work with me in an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, talking to my girlfriend before
you speak to me about it is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: inappropriate and it was a huge mistake on
your part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I will deal with it when I have
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a nice evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says, I don't want to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I say I don't want to talk to you at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're threatening me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason's response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my story to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been told.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't like it, that's something you
have to deal with personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making a big deal about that is going to
be a big mistake letting you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not going to be any discussion
between you and me until I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have a good story to tell as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell the story about how you refused
to give me the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason's response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it seem like I care about your story,
Gabby?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I want to tell you that I am skipping
some text.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that I have a problem with
you guys knowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I should say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason says personal shit about my family,
you know, and like says completely
[SPEAKER_01]: inappropriate, inaccurate comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, those I prefer not be
shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I mean, if if I were to
read it to you, you would think Jason is a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you're not already thinking
that like who starts bringing up people's
[SPEAKER_01]: family in a fight that has nothing to do
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing it because he has no legitimate
ground to stand on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's grasping at straws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also why he's not here to tell
his side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so skip some text.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations on opening up a can of
worms that you're not prepared to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't text me anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what he's saying to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Oh, don't forget about the
partner story where you're never even said
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for killing the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm supposed to apologize for
killing my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so again, like, Jason, for some
reason thinks I killed his clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: the clones that I had for years before he
ever had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it was super unfortunate that that I
didn't take care of those plants better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I accept full responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't Oh, Jason, sorry, Ray really
wants to get in the picture again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't owe Jason an apology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like, like for losing my own
genetics, I have to apologize to someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I said this to Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, said I'll give you an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you won't accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're a big man only in a small
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should do a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both tell our stories start off on the
good parts, then we can get to where we
[SPEAKER_01]: are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can let it be judged by the
court of public opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think people are going to be are
going to think you're an asshole for
[SPEAKER_01]: withholding the dog for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said we can have heavy days moderate
Jason's response.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even remotely interested in doing
your podcast at this point, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell everyone that I invited you but
you were a chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we skipped some stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I showed you gratitude by mentioning
you your name 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell the story the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell the truth that that deserves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not your marketing agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could care less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak from my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when someone brings up a bad memory,
I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you on a post from 2017 giving
yourself credit that you're not even sure
[SPEAKER_01]: if you deserve?
[SPEAKER_01]: You should tell the world that you're
sorry for killing the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comprende, homeboy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a choice only because I'm giving
you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either end our friendship or you
can make an enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready for either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make the wrong decisions,
Gabriel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he says after some more bullshit,
you actually pissed me off today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm your fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the response is, oh, adjuster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that would be you saying I'm sorry
for killing one of the most legendary
[SPEAKER_01]: clones you were privileged enough to have
thanks to my fucking efforts and my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you couldn't do that yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't do that yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entitlement stopped you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe saying that you for allowing my
girlfriend and you to work together for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept it alive for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: No thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the math, asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your anger and weird self entitlement
complete egomaniacal bullshit has brought
[SPEAKER_01]: me to a major problem, has brought a major
problem right to your door.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made an enemy with your words and
actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lack of actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You killed that plant being a lazy larf on
your couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I think I said this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty awesome that Jason was able to keep
the 91 for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now I don't think he's the only
one to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's people on the East Coast
that have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some that I can mention by name
like JJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they had it for 20 something years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fuck what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so props to Jason for holding
onto that clone for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe if you returned it to me,
I could thank him for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, he doesn't want to give it
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even when I tried to buy it for 500
bucks, he didn't take my order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to thank him for holding
a plant that I gave him that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: withholding from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, that's just one question I
have for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do you feel about the fact that
I gave the chem dog to Jason?
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about how I gave it to him,
taught him how to grow, and he refuses to
[SPEAKER_01]: give me this plant back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, and I told him this
too, because I made a video about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Gabby Staten Island Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: This new sour that I found that I think is
super awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this video, and you can check it out on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a link in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about how I don't know where this
clone came from, but that I think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really great clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to call it the Gabby Staten
Island Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all really a joke at Jason and
not so Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you guys think I had it had it
coming, you can let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason didn't seem to be bothered about it
when I talked to him because I sent them
[SPEAKER_01]: both the link to the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so first with not so Doug,
the most common question I get about the
[SPEAKER_01]: three sour cuts that I have is,
is that the not so sour?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so fucking annoying because like,
what the hell is the not so sour?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like he bred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the clone that he's had,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that gets me,
and I'll be honest with you, it strikes a
[SPEAKER_01]: nerve with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me if I'm right or wrong,
but Jason calling the Chem Dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Chem 91, the VA cut, like what makes
it the VA cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I think it's disrespectful
to Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it to be called the Gabby
cut, you know, because that's not what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if you want to talk about a
cut, you can say, yeah, this is the Chem
[SPEAKER_01]: 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: The provenance is I got it from Gabby who
got it from Greg, you know, or other
[SPEAKER_01]: people can say, I bought it from Jason who
got it from Gabby who got it from Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But attention, attaching your name to a
historical clone like that, just super
[SPEAKER_01]: arrogant, you know, and that combined in
the fact that like, he's keeping it from
[SPEAKER_01]: me because like, he feels because he's
held it for 30 years, like, it's like he's
[SPEAKER_01]: the only one entitled to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think we should call the 91 the
VA cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's disrespectful to Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it feeds Jason's ego,
which is out of control, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I made this joke that I'm calling
this clone the Gabby Staten Island,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly because I didn't know what else to
fucking call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already have two other sours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I asked the person that I got it
from what the provenance on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, I don't know, we just got it
from a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like I said, in my video,
I make it clear that calling it that is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of just a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna stick with it because at this
point, it's like it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I tell everyone that I'm not
taking myself seriously, that I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: bred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even flowered this plant yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I, you know, my buddy flowered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the flower and I got the clones
from the tissue culture lab that he got
[SPEAKER_01]: them from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a fucking joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, to get back on track,
Jason and I, we're not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm never gonna be cool with
this guy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even see it happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, and, and honestly,
I know he feels the same way, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know what his fucking problem
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think like, he's got his head so
far up his ass that he can't realize when
[SPEAKER_01]: he's being an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like trolling me on Instagram,
like, you know, if if me making a comment
[SPEAKER_01]: on a post, which by the way, it's not like
I was searching for this post that came on
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of my feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that triggers him to the point where
he's gonna call me out publicly like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that's fucked up,
you know, and I killed the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, I say it for the record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize to every one of you,
except for Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you haven't seen Jason on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why when you ask me if I have the
chem dog, I, you know, either say no and
[SPEAKER_01]: dodge it or, you know, like, or if you ask
me if I'm releasing the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but now you guys all know that,
you know, Jason doesn't want to give me
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, having said that, another number of
people have stepped up to say they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I should point this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My feeling is, is Jason should just give
it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, when I ask him for the
chem dog, it should be like, sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: Gab, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, it's like six months of dodging
me, you know, and then when he eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: releases it to the public, he says I can
have it if I agree not to sell it for
[SPEAKER_01]: three, four months, and then I agree to
only sell it for a price that he agrees to
[SPEAKER_01]: when he already broke his agreement to me
when I gave him the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just ridiculous, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway, the reason why I made this
podcast is because Jason fucking trolled
[SPEAKER_01]: me and then he threatened me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I read you the messages where
he's like, you're opening up a can of
[SPEAKER_01]: worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, and now you got to deal with my
fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can say I killed a clone, which I
already said that I killed the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, there's really nothing that he
can say that's not gonna make him look
[SPEAKER_01]: like a fucking asshole, and that's why he
didn't do this podcast, and that's why
[SPEAKER_01]: he's probably not gonna fucking say
anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, like, honestly, I'm doing this to
document my weed story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason being an asshole to me is an
unfortunate part of my weed story.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years from now, I don't want to make
the same mistake with Jason again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think it's important to document
your weed stories, good and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm not here to talk shit
about other people, you know, second and
[SPEAKER_01]: third hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the shit that happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I remember what I was gonna say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people really kiss Jason's ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people actually try to kiss
mine, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've ever contacted me and you
start, like, thanking me profusely about,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, my involvement with the chem dog,
I always stop you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always say, hey, look,
I don't think I did that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, I drove the plant across
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't have, you know,
like, I'm part of the story, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, like, the people really responsible
for it is Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, while Jason deserves props,
for keeping a clone for 30 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean, like, it's his fucking
clone, and only his, and, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody, you know, other people have it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same exact fucking clone that he has,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I just think the way he
acts about this clone, it's fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's beyond materialistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, he thinks he owns something
that really can't be owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and he owns something that was
given to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, please, do not call the chem dog,
or the 91, the VA cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's just feeding this guy's
ego, and his ego is already a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: monster balloon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, sorry I had to take this podcast
on a negative spin, but, uh, felt it had
[SPEAKER_01]: to be told.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, thanks for watching, and I'll see you
next time.
