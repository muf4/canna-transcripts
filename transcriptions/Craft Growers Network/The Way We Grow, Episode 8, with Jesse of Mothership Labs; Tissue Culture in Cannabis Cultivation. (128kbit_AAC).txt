[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the way we grow podcast I am your host
[SPEAKER_03]: Nick wolf my co-hosts today are Gabby
Staten Island and cosmic our guest today
[SPEAKER_03]: is Jesse with mothership labs where they
specialize in tissue culture breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: Compliant SOPs and training their mission
is to support the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: through science technology While still
aiming to preserve the culture and
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics that started it all So Jesse,
welcome to the show How are you doing
[SPEAKER_03]: today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Checking out the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's excited about what you guys are doing
and glad to be a part of it For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we were talking a little bit before
the show and you were kind of explaining a
[SPEAKER_03]: few of the different things that you have
going on currently so, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the first thing our viewers
are gonna notice and to any of the
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners out there check us out on
YouTube, but You have a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: plants sitting behind you So why don't you
talk a little bit about like what what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing today and what's new in your
grow world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm down in Florida right now
Working with the company they do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamentals and all kinds of different
plants So this is their TC lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a crazy amount And what we're
trying to do is help, you know build a
[SPEAKER_00]: system to where you could benefit breeders
cultivators have stock of just
[SPEAKER_00]: disease-free plants And kind of build a
new model essentially, so I hope we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to tell you more about that as it
develops but a lot of good people
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic growers and Kind of shifting
into being able to help preserve and
[SPEAKER_00]: provide at a much larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Definitely been traveling a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in Michigan too and Thankfully,
I'm in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm humid again, but Yeah, it's pretty
cool to see like so many so many plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and the management and everything the
operations behind it It is a ton of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely looks like it and I think
you were saying that this facility alone
[SPEAKER_00]: produces over five million unique X plants
per year I Believe so and they do I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like 200 acres huge facilities a
lot of different plants nurseries and It's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what I see, you know in the future
that at least in some areas Starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic stock and professional breeding
Kind of evolving into that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, lots of lots of plants here So
it's exciting to see things at a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and what it what it could be Big
part of our goal is like how does that
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to?
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and How can we kind of shape
that so it benefits Growers and breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: that that kind of started this and then
you know doing this for a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Yeah, I feel like that's really
important it seems like there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders From yesteryear to use a term
that still don't have access to tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture or different lab Testings that
would help them make either more educated
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding Practices or decisions as well as
also just being able to preserve a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: more genetics at a lower cost considering
Costs aren't going down when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: overhead in the cannabis industry Where
tissue culture though as an investment
[SPEAKER_03]: could definitely lower your overhead when
it comes to even even just something as
[SPEAKER_03]: simple as maintaining a large stock
population Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep why we came out as tissue culture and
try to at least educate and help support
[SPEAKER_00]: that side is I've been growing in around
cannabis since I was like 10 years old I
[SPEAKER_00]: think growing up in Kentucky I started
there and then went to commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: operations and then to biotech and then
back to cannabis So I had had that
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality like I I'm not sending my
breeding lines to somebody else in a lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know sure so it's kind of started like
teach people how to do it and Make it
[SPEAKER_00]: easier better more affordable And then we
can start trading and do a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: business that way like I could send stuff
to your lab We can you know trade
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes for breeding and compound that
kind of success absolutely Collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: for the win Collaboration man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so front-facing its tissue culture
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a huge need in the market for that
we do a lot of you know molecular breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and operation stuff and Just trying to
support Where we saw the needs for
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators in the market, you know,
and just build off that, you know For sure
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, you kind of already
touched on it a little bit But let's take
[SPEAKER_03]: it back a little bit and talk about your
first experience with growing plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: general What got you into wanting to
pursue a career or a life path in plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it sounded like you did cannabis
pretty darn early, but whereas Was there
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that kind of piqued your
interests earlier than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always somebody's older brother,
you know that Makes the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it was and Just being
young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like this seems cool and being a
part of that group and I wasn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a bunch of weed that that young I
tried it just being around the plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: what interested me so Kentucky there the
culture there for cannabis has been going
[SPEAKER_00]: on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's people in the mountains
that have been just Generations of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: there like that's that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they have been doing So it's
definitely been around for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: there and as I got older I think I was
looking more the scientific side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to I was interested like how
does the world work and how does this
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time it was like a cool plant that
I could attach science to You know in
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like corn and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't care about corn and
wheat other than eating it So I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what did I was like this is I could
be cool and learn science Behind weed it
[SPEAKER_00]: got started it out You know growing up as
I got older my father I ended up getting
[SPEAKER_00]: neurological disease and things like that
at the same time That you started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: indications that cannabis can help you
know Alzheimer's and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces so that stuck with me early on and
where I wanted to continue pursuing the
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and the research side,
so a lot of stuff in between there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know getting older and going through,
you know high school and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Then friends started getting cancer or
disease that it can potentially help help
[SPEAKER_00]: cure or alleviate, you know, so Outside of
you know growing around the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing you know doing everything on tour
will say I Just like I have to learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to learn how to manage operations I
have to learn how to breed and then after
[SPEAKER_00]: learn the science and That's kind of where
I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started learning how to grow from you
know older brothers and everyone else in
[SPEAKER_00]: those communities And then moved out to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I wanted to You know be like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a professional environment now And
started there as a tremor actually How are
[SPEAKER_03]: you when you moved out to Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem that long ago it was 2014
so I think I was like 28 I want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, it's crazy to think about And at the
time because I was I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Hustling doing everything else
and just being in that that side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry To get an apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to get a job and show everything on
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh man, so I Moved here and
was delivering pizzas To start out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like whatever it takes So I was
highly motivated like I got to make change
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life to pursue this stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of good people in my life supported
me down that road and so delivery,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know going from that world to You know
dropping a large pepperoni off for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: $2 tip was just crazy like whatever I'll
do it I'll take it man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So How long had you been growing before
you moved to Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when it starting at 10,
you know, I did grow here and there And
[SPEAKER_00]: play around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think getting serious with it I was
closer to 16 17 where I was like I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: grow weed And there's a lot of different
ways out there by then indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know was taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just used to outdoor Kentucky soil
is incredible So it's really easy to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'd flick a seed out there and come
back and there's just some amazing weed
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting the indoor Game we had,
you know, hps lights and all that Took it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like a different learning curve,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nutrients and all these other factors
that I was like, you can't just throw it
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and it grows though started
getting on forums and learning from other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that I knew and So yeah,
I've been growing for a long time a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different methods You know,
we had some hydro guys in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like that's awesome weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this one says huge community out
there that I got to get experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and Start breeding early on and
and learn some of those things before
[SPEAKER_00]: research and a lot of the science behind
it started coming out too, so Well talk a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit about some of those early
growing experiences and kind of where you
[SPEAKER_03]: found success and where you might have had
some Trepidations that might have led you
[SPEAKER_03]: away from a specific style into another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, so Kentucky is high humidity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: very high that end of the season I
Remember one it was I think is Alaskan
[SPEAKER_00]: Thunder We had like under a highway Like
we should let him go that one lasted into
[SPEAKER_00]: December just No problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like the easy way of growing
that like I knew And I love outdoor the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky soil grown, too It's just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some stuff up in the hills there
that just like perfect all year round and
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into the Indoor stuff and that's
where I was like, I don't know if I like
[SPEAKER_00]: this at all just way too much management
and Measuring neutral, you know chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and all that stuff produce a
different product I was unfamiliar with so
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know how to do it that you know
starting out But really when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to like older growers that had
been doing it a long time and Learned that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could grow some like really really good
weed just follow what they're doing That's
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started enjoying it a lot more,
you know, cuz you're growing bad weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's not fun So the yeah getting
over that hump, I guess And there's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, few different people there weren't
huge huge grows I was growing up around
[SPEAKER_00]: Lexington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have outskirts of town and some of
those areas that were Easy to set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some basements or and then we had
farmland away from the city that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: go out to grow a lot more so I think of
the genetics there Was the most exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: part at least looking back a lot of
old-school stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it forever, but the stuff
the the Generational farmers had didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really have names for it was the best So
you're thinking selecting over years and
[SPEAKER_00]: years of this they You know, some of these
have resistances that high humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, boy try this and stuff like that
That grow just incredibly well in those
[SPEAKER_00]: areas And that's how they fed their
families, you know, that's how I was
[SPEAKER_00]: taught like this is part of our family's
heritage and How we're gonna survive So I
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of beaten into my head early on
Like just don't mess with people's
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess with them, you know,
everybody had their made cash crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: was you know, the northern lights cross
over here or and Product was just traded
[SPEAKER_00]: like I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some of my northern lights
and you know, Afghani's came in and then
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and I think that's what got me on
breeding and Trying to learn more about it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's hard to identify new genetics
when you didn't know that world existed
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything is weed at some point And
then somebody brings you something special
[SPEAKER_00]: like what is this like where did it come
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah When you first found that super
special weed since you were kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: already plugged into the growing community
in the area Did you immediately kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, how are they growing it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to learn how to do that Because
that's the best and what was what were
[SPEAKER_03]: some of those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like methods that you saw that people were
doing that in your opinion produced the
[SPEAKER_03]: best bud when you were first Finding some
of that stuff that you thought were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know levels above the other stuff It
was the soil grown At the time it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like all these inputs and knowledge behind
what they do is like those little tricks
[SPEAKER_00]: that These old guys had they're like,
yeah, just let it sit there for a while I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the one method that was actually
discussed so you remember subcooled mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the the little mini pools And stuff
cook your own soil start doing some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those recipes and modifications to it and
that's what I was like Oh, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is like crazy weed Before you see a
lot of that like call flat weed back then
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's green tastes phenomenal Everyone
loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in comparison is like it's a flat weed
gets the job done And you had these new
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes coming out from you know,
some of these known breeders And people
[SPEAKER_00]: started catching on I was like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like weed to me the taste
does just everything Was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's when the organic like it
was all organic at that point The weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was smoking and getting older
brothers and their friends bringing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in from Cali It was like this is insane
but I kind of gravitated towards just
[SPEAKER_00]: those organic mixes and How they're
keeping that soil alive and they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know the microbial thing There's
everything behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're following a recipe too,
you know So learning that way was it was
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome because familiar to me from
growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yes nature takes care of most of
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely stuck with me Nowadays,
I want to go back and grow more outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I just gotta I'm growing them in
tubes And stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so so then you know what what
translated you out of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you were focused on growing and then
you said I want to actually go more into
[SPEAKER_03]: biotechnologies and find out more it
sounded like you were really interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: how these plants were growing and what was
causing them to do their different things
[SPEAKER_03]: and and Processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what kind of led you into that path?
[SPEAKER_00]: It started because I just I was growing
just some flat weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like I got to make my weed better
So, you know you start reading and get
[SPEAKER_00]: into soil science and then down that
rabbit hole was I would say the first step
[SPEAKER_00]: and Then my weed started competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like science and science is the way
right and just kept reinforcing those
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pieces for me and like my my dad was
a researcher too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were I had this scientific mind from
what I was told and I was in that that
[SPEAKER_00]: world of research, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd sure beat other researchers when I was
little and so I had a lot of that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing me in that direction too and I
think Weed being you know in my life at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I like I could attach it to that
like I'm cool because I grow weed But I
[SPEAKER_00]: also love science, you know, it was I
think it was important to me when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: that early stages of my life to Acceptance
and all the things humans go through
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just continue to follow it,
you know, just figuring out how things
[SPEAKER_03]: work It sort of adds a legitimacy to
something that was seen as something so
[SPEAKER_03]: Infamous in terms of what a what a career
path could take if you wanted to follow
[SPEAKER_03]: something where you were growing cannabis
But then you started to talk about it in
[SPEAKER_03]: this very More higher education scientific
Terminology some people would take you a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit more serious and you're not the
first person that I've heard say that
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the communication it Brought
to you where you like your equal right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this guy grows the best weed but
I know some of these things and it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: bridging that communication and building
those relationships, I guess So give me a
[SPEAKER_00]: different perspective to where like I can
do all these things that Still cool and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know associated and accepted I guess
and we meet, you know every once in a
[SPEAKER_00]: while and share our experiences and our
weed and Learn more things and start
[SPEAKER_00]: learning together, you know as a community
so definitely a big influence just
[SPEAKER_00]: learning so I come back and be like check
this out like live what I found out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do or And it started becoming a lot more
fun when I the more I knew the more fun I
[SPEAKER_00]: had meeting up with some of my friends and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a huge influence and If I if I did my
math correctly, you said you've been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue culture for 12 years But you moved
out to pursue cannabis cultivation in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado in 2014 So you were already
dabbling in tissue culture before you
[SPEAKER_03]: moved out to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I did started with mushrooms much
like a lot of a lot of other guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: right That was fun as well And I wasn't
doing like tissue culture every day or
[SPEAKER_00]: going, you know hard down that rabbit hole
I came out because I was still learning
[SPEAKER_00]: about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like I figure out how to grow this
at a commercial scale So it kind of on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back burner for a little while and
reintroduced by somebody else that just
[SPEAKER_00]: passing more knowledge, you know and
motivating me To start learning more about
[SPEAKER_00]: that just another avenue that we can
develop tools with Learning like first
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is just unfamiliar just
very different from mushroom work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and But I was pulling in the
right direction so I could start building
[SPEAKER_00]: the knowledge base and Playing around I
had my own equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had for a long time and starting to
get into the Cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like this is not working at all but is
getting used to the tools and figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: what's possible and Knowing that some of
these things exist in the world of science
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivation Maybe a better grower and
more motivated to learn I guess Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been definitely been around a long
time For sure that I mean I I know that In
[SPEAKER_03]: general in agriculture, it's been used for
different fruiting trees and stuff since
[SPEAKER_03]: around the 70s in high production But was
even dabbled in in the 30s and 40s It's
[SPEAKER_03]: got a long history almost almost a century
of use within agriculture Which is super
[SPEAKER_03]: impressive for something that is still
almost Viewed as the cutting edge of new
[SPEAKER_03]: technology In a blossoming market like the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Yeah, it's for hard to propagate
species, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so with orchids and Yeah,
you know coming out and everyone's like
[SPEAKER_00]: have you heard of tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been perfected I feel for
cannabis specifically and the applications
[SPEAKER_00]: and Long-term storage and all the other
other stuff you can do with tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's I Think part of the reason
for that is that cannabis is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to propagate plant and If it was
if it was difficult to propagate then we
[SPEAKER_01]: probably would have gone to tissue culture
much sooner But because it's pretty easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to take clones, you know, we We haven't
done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a quick question and a comment for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: First The question is are you familiar
with the growth stores?
[SPEAKER_01]: New earth in Kentucky they were in new
earth Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's some today good I think
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they had growth stores in the 80s
during Green Merchant and they still have
[SPEAKER_01]: one today in Louisville and We're actually
interviewing them tomorrow on the your
[SPEAKER_01]: weed store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's so I was wondering those guys
We might know that some of the same people
[SPEAKER_00]: so these the kind of like growth the hydro
shops and stuff there obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where people went to get like Fox
farm and right, you know all the supplies
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of them I haven't kept up with I
know some of them kind of changed names or
[SPEAKER_00]: locations because it was starting to You
know get watched a little more I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, what what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know one of them moved to
Louisville.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering if it's that same crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, yeah That would be crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're interviewing them tomorrow and
the the comment that I wanted to make is
[SPEAKER_01]: is that most people don't realize that
Kentucky and Florida were hotbeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis, you know people yeah
people when they think about yeah cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: they think about California and but you
know Yesterday, I think Nick and I were or
[SPEAKER_01]: me and someone else were talking about the
Gainesville green famous weed from Florida
[SPEAKER_01]: and You know so much cannabis was grown in
Kentucky as well It was just number one
[SPEAKER_01]: export.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think yeah for a while and you know that
the weed I was used to a California had
[SPEAKER_00]: great weed too, but like some of these
Kentucky boys are Crazy like how how good
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that flower is man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable Yeah, definitely they
it's been around a long time and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: places out there like you you just don't
go You know, you don't want to go out
[SPEAKER_00]: there at all That's and that's kind of how
I grew up like just respecting the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and the people like don't mess with it You
know, let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them keep their genetics and
everything's cool because it was a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: light like they're feeding families and
Trade and all that for a long long time I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I was lucky to get brought up in
that that side of community to just
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching me respect for all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah Insane high quality weed has grown
in Kentucky for sure Some of the exciting
[SPEAKER_03]: things in your in your grow world right
right now about tissue culture Like what's
[SPEAKER_03]: what have you been developing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been working on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you found some successes and
some some failures that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be able to help teach the community
that's looking into either starting a
[SPEAKER_03]: small home tissue culture lab or even
commercial cultivators that may Be
[SPEAKER_03]: listening or watching this that are
looking into potentially sourcing good
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue culture What are some of these
different things that you feel like you
[SPEAKER_03]: could shed a little bit more light on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Close a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot there So tissue culture the
extremely powerful tool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If used properly The main pieces of that
that I hear or discussed about right now
[SPEAKER_00]: is like genetic storage pathogen
remediation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: micropropagation So what what I set out to
do was I you know, I've run all the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, MS media DKW everything in between
and I always explain what DKW is and what
[SPEAKER_03]: MS media are for those that oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Your Shiggy scoop that is basically
these names are the scientists who created
[SPEAKER_00]: them the most part right They discovered
that they have all the Components to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain plant life in vitro in vitro
meaning I think it's Italian in glass So
[SPEAKER_00]: sustaining life in glass Essentially,
so all the what that means is there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: you have your nutrients hormones vitamins
it's all these things that your cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue need to survive and and grow right
in combination with light and Your your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment temperatures So if you look at
the different forms of that DKW,
[SPEAKER_00]: just another form is driver kuyaki walnut
media There's specific ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: formulated for tobacco and different
plants across the board that Scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: work on and develop and validate be like
this is for best for this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting out, you know the a lot of the
Woody culture media and protocols and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was just used for cannabis DKW
seems to work better for growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's made for walnuts So if you think
of it that that lens we're giving the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong I was like we're giving the wrong
Food to these cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want completely different profile of
nutrients and vitamins and everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I was used to using like
MS DKW And some modifications so when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started getting into it We actually
started to research that a research
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory Molecular genetics We installed
tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had GCMS HPLC so we can look at all the
terpenes and just everything for breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: I Might have been one of the first out in
Colorado that we had full laboratory set
[SPEAKER_00]: up grow rooms on rotation Planting seed
and we were trying to identify Qtl markers
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative trait loci so basically where
these genes are and what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the Example, I'll use like
the color purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do these genes that are responsible
for the color purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: live When we identify we can test for them
pop a bunch of seed this big and tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's gonna be purple Or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like kind of the short version of
that which we can get more into that
[SPEAKER_00]: later, too In order to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to sustain life and use tissue
culture and develop these things So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of background there, but starting
with those available media And public
[SPEAKER_00]: research and everything we could gather It
starts at woody culture protocols and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you quickly see like all right,
we can get these to live we get them to
[SPEAKER_00]: root and but they're just not healthy,
they're not healthy enough to Manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what I try to teach is it's not
like micro propagation and it's you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn how to manipulate this tissue
within this environment and set up so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the exciting things that I've been
working on just this past year is
[SPEAKER_00]: fine-tuning what that is like the exact
Components to tissue culture media for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp The exact hormones and
you know, just the entire program to
[SPEAKER_00]: support that so Went I think it is the
entire year 12 hour days just going
[SPEAKER_00]: through it That's been the most exciting
for me as far as you know what we we
[SPEAKER_00]: developed and what we're working on now
Because it makes such a huge difference
[SPEAKER_00]: like perfect health all the way through
rooting no problem subcultures Zero loss
[SPEAKER_00]: in health throughout the process because
we want to get Sustainable storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just taking clone to different
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was seed that'd be different,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's The best way to store genetics I
say but since we're gonna hold on to all
[SPEAKER_00]: these clones We want to start there first
because we're breeders were cultivators
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to store it long-term without
mutations or loss of the fidelity to
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics themselves adding on other stress
factors that cause epigenetic changes And
[SPEAKER_00]: things long-term that could affect how
these genes are expressing a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: say genetic drift and Which don't give me
start on that But that's for a population
[SPEAKER_03]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for a single plant So happy to
say that yeah This wolf guy's pretty smart
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we started talking I was like,
all right, I'll be on your podcast sir But
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at all the the issues right
you're cloning off mother so we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop the tools that actually work,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that with MS and DKW media
and everything else for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's just Hard to use and
they're not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see deficiencies In the plant you
can see things are just harder to root
[SPEAKER_03]: when you pull them out What were some of
the major changes that you made from using
[SPEAKER_03]: MS or DKW media to your current setup?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's gonna be something that
a lot of people Should hear because I have
[SPEAKER_03]: a feeling I might know a couple of them
But from someone that has as much
[SPEAKER_03]: experience as you I feel like it'd be
really good to hear that Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it was just more cow mag
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: after all this time I was like,
are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Calcium nitrate so that you're also
increasing the nitrogen load So Lowering
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of ammonia nitrate,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Definitely contributes a ton to
hyper hydrolicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you get that translucent
look and they they kind of shrivel So
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, there's there's a lot of factors
There right so you start at ammonia
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate So you definitely lower that
that's like immediately available nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can they can use quickly Also as
way too much ammonia, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other one is cow mag calcium
magnesium need to be raised up I just
[SPEAKER_00]: started using calcium nitrate so What else
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some things that You I just
stripped out all together One of them I
[SPEAKER_00]: think cobalt chloride DKW has nickel don't
need nickel has way too much sulfur to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to balance sulfur And then if you
look at the how nutrients are absorbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the tissue, right it's through diffusion
So if you can manipulate the density of
[SPEAKER_00]: your agar You can start controlling how
much of that those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's getting earlier The rate of that
absorption, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those components together are made
a huge difference, but then you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the vitamin complex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people there's gamborg b5
vitamins Diamond hydrochloride in that
[SPEAKER_00]: There's way way way too much because all
these things that they're not balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna change how these nutrients are
Absorbed by the plant it's gonna Change
[SPEAKER_00]: how the sugar is processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically diamond hydrochloride
it'll Kind of catalyze how that's
[SPEAKER_00]: processed and pulled in And if anything's
out of balance, it's just like Just
[SPEAKER_00]: picture deficiency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All this has to be be kind of balanced and
done and then proper Ventilation for your
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels is huge for cannabis So,
you know DKW does a great job At least I
[SPEAKER_00]: use MS sometimes from out of my mix It has
a lot higher nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing a Marissa dissection,
you could start getting that process
[SPEAKER_00]: moving a little quicker I found Then DKW
and Good getting into more tissue and
[SPEAKER_00]: growth DKW seems to work better The
vitamins had a huge impact though More
[SPEAKER_00]: than I'd expect them to do I guess So if
you look at there's I guess a reference
[SPEAKER_00]: called Liebig's barrel or Liebig's law of
the minimums, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're missing one of those planks Yeah,
yeah And I could send links or pictures or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever to help share with your viewers
too But it's the same kind of concept and
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's Mulder's nutrient
Interactions, right all that stuff applies
[SPEAKER_00]: in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still needs this balanced nutrition and
We're just promoting it with hormones and
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementing sugars because it can't
Photosynthesize and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of break it down like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like cannabis wants cannabis food
tons of references we can look at like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know all the nutrients that we use so
just Throw weed with right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start there with that balance,
you can build and make something effective
[SPEAKER_00]: The there's other amino acids and some
things that I started working with that
[SPEAKER_00]: are helping to control that that rate and
Make it more bioavailable and process that
[SPEAKER_00]: we found extremely effective And I think
that's what started making Cutting time
[SPEAKER_00]: off of growth like we can get rapid crazy
growth from some of these final formulas
[SPEAKER_00]: but in order to understand that and
compare we Run every single trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know public research every formula
that's available just to understand and
[SPEAKER_00]: start manipulating those those factors,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Deionized water huge or RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people use coconut water and
all that is gonna relate to absorption of
[SPEAKER_00]: these nutrients and being able to speed up
slow down and control that metabolisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: right the light intensity the light
spectrum Everything so every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss tissue culture people are like
give me the formula That's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you the formula and you can
just fail miserably still right you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the internal components and the
external and the techniques and That's
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes it successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what that's what a formula
is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just one little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the entire thing But you have to put
it together correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question something that you just
said about light and So first you said
[SPEAKER_01]: that these plants can't photosynthesize
and but then you said that the light is
[SPEAKER_01]: important and this is something that Nick
and I were discussing and also You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little hobby tissue culture lab,
you know with a friend of mine And he was
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me so my friend was saying that we
don't need very much light and You know
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick said that you know in his research
that you need like 150 to 200 of PPFD and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at your jars over there and
they're stacked one on top of another With
[SPEAKER_01]: what appears to be fairly low light?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could answer the question about
like what are the light requirements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I know it's you know
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well picture being able to control all
this right so you're looking at And
[SPEAKER_00]: there's it's a two-part kind of trick
question right the photos photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: part so I'll start there photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creating sugars essentially energy
to grow the plant We supplement sugars to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you know provide and boost that
especially at the cellular level They're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna be making their own a lot of
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will stop photosynthesizing and their
Stomatoes kind of get stuck Close and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just you'll become an stasis right if you
have the ventilated caps and you know co2
[SPEAKER_00]: still present That's something I haven't
measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd need I would love to and you
know do a Some deeper research on that but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of like textbook They slow and
then stop photosynthesizing Is it true?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm gonna look into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see I'll be get some answers,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But from from what I've heard it's It they
do stop photosynthesizing, but they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: stop their revisco cycle But they just
supplement the photosynthates that they
[SPEAKER_03]: would produce through photosynthesis With
the provided carbohydrate load within the
[SPEAKER_03]: media so they no longer need to provide
their own Carbohydrates to still continue
[SPEAKER_03]: this revisco cycle of nutrient processing
and continuing to build cellular growth
[SPEAKER_03]: and cellular multiplication Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at developing sugarless
media Right and so think about that the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need co2 you need Kind of these like
traditional things plants, you know how we
[SPEAKER_00]: grow plants That'd be huge just way less
contamination or issues and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile work and stuff like that but I
think getting down to measuring it and
[SPEAKER_00]: Being like, okay, this is true at maybe at
these points and what is that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: process or curve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look like right just to get a deeper
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get into light intensity These if
you're able to like slow that metabolism
[SPEAKER_00]: and process down right cooler temperatures
lower intensity and you're just slowing
[SPEAKER_00]: all that process Maybe higher density
media so slowing that diffusion process as
[SPEAKER_00]: well And these are all different species
Behind me here When you get at scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want everything just growing
rapidly, you know, you need to control
[SPEAKER_00]: that production cycle And you can use a
combination of these things to to slip,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know make that happen For cannabis,
I think I had one in vitro the same vessel
[SPEAKER_00]: for about a year and You know pulled it
out and it was just fine But if it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a vented cap it had really dense Agar
and higher concentration of the of
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients in there so if it lasts,
you know, it's just kind of slowly pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: that up That gets you an idea how you can
manipulate and change some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: factors But my main production Rack will
say It's like 50 micro moles per square
[SPEAKER_00]: meter That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just very low They it's slow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's but spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only almost balanced spectrum of
Veg and flowering right you blue and red
[SPEAKER_00]: that's almost even on there so and I've
done, you know veg lights or you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier blue spectrum and You can get a
little more stretchier, you know elongated
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, but I get to the rooting phase and
it just I wasn't seeing the results that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted so Keeping it under the spectrum in
that intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the highest all goes Up to 80
micro moles per square meter You're not
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing the plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to force them to grow using
higher light and hormones specifically you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be very Judicious using your
hormones to promote that type of growth So
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that zone where you're not just
like forcing all that on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know control within a margin That's
when you start seeing health and and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets easier because the plants will react
faster Their tissues is healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They root faster everything else And I've
done it under I think 100 100 micro moles
[SPEAKER_00]: per square meter different lights that I
had at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw excellent growth But it's just not
nearly the same as right, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've developed now because you can get
More stress that you're adding on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: you know on the epigenetic level and
things that we're setting up to start
[SPEAKER_00]: digging through that Could affect the
genetics because in the end we want you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the same cut or even better coming
out than what what's going in to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue filter process, right and A lot of
people don't understand like how these
[SPEAKER_00]: things can accumulate and change
epigenetic stressors and methylation can
[SPEAKER_03]: be passed on to the next generation to
Briefly describe what methylation is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard that term used before it
as it pertains to like the degradation of
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics or Changes in the other genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they say I guess an easier example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different forms of this that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Your DNA is not going to change but
through stress and this happens in humans
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, which is terrifying You can
accumulate these methyl groups We'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: too much into histone Protein stuff,
but it starts limiting its ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: transcribe right or its ability to express
so over time And again, it's heritable to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next generation Over time you can you
know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Accumulate these things again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't change your DNA, but it starts
limiting those genes the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: express right so when people discuss like
man this plant just isn't the same Or it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dudding out or whatever It's
like you've been cloning off this for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this thing's just stressed out
and It's not happy right So that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: form of this and you can look in,
you know going deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's specific locations that this can
happen on That starts binding it in onto
[SPEAKER_00]: histone proteins, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all this stuff is rat like
wrapped up So where it could fit in to the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it would be stretched out
pretty low But more of those that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: picture like a magnet It's just binding
that to the sites and it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: restricting its ability to transcribe and
therefore expressing I'll explain that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think I understand that it's kind of like
a they're almost like suppressors of
[SPEAKER_03]: expression where As they accumulate over
time you can lose more and more of the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic expression that may have made that
specific cultivar desirable initially And
[SPEAKER_03]: and one of the examples that I feel like
is very fascinating within this discussion
[SPEAKER_03]: as well is I've even heard people have a
specific cut and They just loved how it
[SPEAKER_03]: was performing and they're like I just
want to get this on to Culture so that I
[SPEAKER_03]: can preserve it for the long run they get
it into culture They've been assured that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's safe and backed up so they kill off
their mother populations They then get
[SPEAKER_03]: this tissue culture back and it has all
the coas to ensure that it there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: mishandling where it could have been
Accidentally exchanged with another
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic but they give this genetic back So
it's for sure what they gave them and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of a sudden it is completely different
undesirable and not what they wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow anymore and it's because these these
different Sort of genetic inhibitors that
[SPEAKER_03]: build up over time can actually create a
more desirable product when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis that we like to smoke and
consume as well as you know, maybe there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a picturesque quality to it where
Something removes the ability for the
[SPEAKER_03]: brachs to structure in a certain way So
that but the trichome density remains the
[SPEAKER_03]: same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of a sudden it's just this more
frosty resin dense flower that then when
[SPEAKER_03]: removed the flower structure becomes
larger which Technically is a healthier
[SPEAKER_03]: plant because it can support greater
embryo life for more seeds because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire purpose of the plant in In
nature is to produce seeds so that it can
[SPEAKER_03]: preserve its genetic lineage So I've heard
this, you know Be viewed as oh man,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's ruined this cultivar that I love
versus Almost now we have to say listen we
[SPEAKER_03]: want to get the cultivar that we love on
tissue culture as soon as possible Because
[SPEAKER_03]: we will be able to go back to that same
expression time and time again without
[SPEAKER_03]: viral loads pathogen loads other sort of
genetic stressors that sort of are sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: there like you said and they attach
themselves to the plants genetic structure
[SPEAKER_03]: over time where it it's only then removed
through Either like a meristematic tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture where you're removing it from the
vascular structure and all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: things That's what I find that really
fascinating that that you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Yeah, if you think about oh,
do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh what I was gonna say is You know,
this is something that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced with I think most pronounced
is with the sour diesel and So oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, you know our day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a clone that Me and my friends have
had for decades but it's just not the
[SPEAKER_01]: same, you know, it's gone through those
epigenetic changes and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like It's just it's it's what it is,
you know, I think in another podcast what
[SPEAKER_01]: we talked about is you know, if you have a
clone of let's say wolf for example and
[SPEAKER_01]: One clone one of the clone you have two
clones, right and one of them eats a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy diet every day and then The other
one eats Burger King and Taco Bell by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time that they're you know, 30 years down
the line They're going to be significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we take the clone of the Taco
Bell wolf You know, it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the same as the clone of the wolf that ate
a healthy diet all of his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lessons are number one Always eat a
healthy diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay away from Taco Bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat some fruit But also like yeah,
like Nick said is we want to tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture these genetics early on You know,
and if we would have tissue culture this
[SPEAKER_01]: hour, you know 10 or 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have this problem that we do
know So that's and you know, you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture specifically Marissa
culture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It resets the genetics just like it was
from seed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's not true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does a lot Of these health,
you know benefits reviving getting rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these pathogens and everything else
even Young again So I'm gonna make I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: working on it and it's not and it's right
here and it's not gonna take away all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bad things that you did Right,
but it could or I think it could right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this has to do So just a if
you go down really really small or Let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say Marissa that section right the
majority of these issues You have
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes, you know fungus bacteria that
you have no idea or even in there right of
[SPEAKER_00]: Accumulating even viruses that people just
don't test for right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge factor that could limit
vigor yield performance all those things
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get rid of all of that and that's
the mechanical action of just taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: You know new cells, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tissue for those to live in But
if you get to and same with viruses or
[SPEAKER_00]: most viruses if you get to these Changes
or these modifications, I guess on the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: itself Then how does that be removed?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some indications to these the NAD
pathways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So niacin nicotinic acid can promote
removing those There's some It's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different mode of action I would say or
describe it as That some of these sites
[SPEAKER_00]: are filled up before you know,
methylation can kind of stick on there So
[SPEAKER_00]: it is possible and I think some of that
does get removed If you're using some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know, the right formula or
additives or Combinations right and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at the point now where we can measure
these things and Technology didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: all this before So we have new sequencing
methods next generation sequencing came
[SPEAKER_00]: out right and now we have Nano poor
sequencing where I can do I could
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence, you know in field applications
on piece of equipment probably this big
[SPEAKER_00]: come out to the grow sequence it and then
Run it right so we have the technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: now we can we can accurately measure and
monitor the epigenome right so now We can
[SPEAKER_00]: verify these things have been removed or
accumulating What we don't know yet is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem that all of these things create
amongst themselves That's where I start
[SPEAKER_00]: this going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get methyl groups and then you know
ubiquitization and all these other other
[SPEAKER_00]: long words and what kind of pressures do
the interactions between those cause like
[SPEAKER_00]: we keep going down that rabbit hole,
but The more we understand that the more
[SPEAKER_00]: we can Create and figure out to truly
clean Genetics down to the DNA level right
[SPEAKER_03]: removing these methylation methyl groups
so it sounds like if I'm understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly you're providing almost like a a
growth hormone or a regulator to the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: to help promote its expediting growth away
from contaminated genetic material which
[SPEAKER_03]: makes me think a lot about how Resetting
genetics if you are using clonal
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation is extremely important to do
it regularly to maintain Vigorous growth
[SPEAKER_03]: because vigorous growth will help Not
necessarily remove pathogens, but prevent
[SPEAKER_03]: the buildup within the tissue and create a
lower threshold Or a lower economic
[SPEAKER_03]: threshold that you need to meet in order
to make sure that it's still Maintaining
[SPEAKER_03]: at a specific output as a crop But it
sounds like what we are able to do is use
[SPEAKER_03]: that to then even completely remove some
of these epigenetic changes over time by
[SPEAKER_03]: successively outgrowing the different
aspects that are preventing a Genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: expression that was desirable that is no
longer found Yeah, it was Everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: always more complex right there's way more
You know deeper stuff you can get into
[SPEAKER_00]: that is my hope and that is What we're
building towards I will never say I can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that until I have the data in front of me,
and I've proven that you know But if you
[SPEAKER_00]: think these things are possible,
and this is how it functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like me like that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like okay well We have a path forward
to where we could potentially you know
[SPEAKER_00]: truly reset these genetics And maybe we
get the right the sour diesel back to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was right the even in the you
know in the grow room it's a The result is
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype by environmental interaction
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get these things to express more
or less and we can measure that you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA sequencing and all these you know
bunch of high-level science stuff and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can measure Gene expression We can now see
you know epigenetic pressures and things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are are Restricting their ability to
express we know the exact you know sites
[SPEAKER_00]: of gene regulation and That controls those
things you know it's like h h3 On h3 k1 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like a very specific point,
so that's how far science has come and how
[SPEAKER_00]: do we manipulate?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very targeted approach Rather than
having to sort of Use like a shotgun blast
[SPEAKER_03]: to try and get everything all at once or
hope that you hit a few things while
[SPEAKER_03]: you're while you're Trying this specific
remediation method you can almost now take
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant tissue run it through the
analysis It spits out the data for you and
[SPEAKER_03]: of course I'm simplifying this but it gets
you the data you take that data you you go
[SPEAKER_03]: through oh this data fits in here on the
Chart I can now take this application or
[SPEAKER_03]: this methodology apply it to that plant
tissue and we should have a 10% success
[SPEAKER_03]: rate of removing the the issue that we
found Retest all the data or retest all
[SPEAKER_03]: the tissue after that next successive
generation take that plant that shows that
[SPEAKER_03]: it was removed and boom you have the next
the next line within your your Steps to
[SPEAKER_03]: remove everything that you want to remove
from the the epigenetic changes Since I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: the simple simpleton here and not as smart
as you and and wolf To simplify it and use
[SPEAKER_01]: the same analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using before you know if we have
Wolf who's been eating Taco Bell and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Burger King for 30 years There are
things that he can do to improve his
[SPEAKER_01]: health you know like if he has high
cholesterol Maybe he takes cholesterol
[SPEAKER_01]: medication and stuff like that and he can
lower it so there's certain things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do you know with tissue culture and
other means to improve the health of our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and our genetics, but we don't know
how to Turn back the clock and fix every
[SPEAKER_01]: all the damage that we've done yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe someday we will You know but but
currently like we know what we know and
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're learning more every day,
and it's exciting Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like we have because there's so many
fields of research that like I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn everything there's a problem I'm
like go learn this now But if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: how fast technology and research
everything is is rapidly developing right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have AI Integrating those fields of
research with AI with genetics with Then
[SPEAKER_00]: it I think we'll find solutions really
fast But it's a combination right keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your genetics You know if I'm reading I'll
pop a bunch of seed put a coffee in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're keeping it in tissue culture,
and it's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just adding more Problems to it
right so just don't keep it in tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture keep a healthy mom until you you
can you can figure it out because those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of You can run into mutations
epigenetic pressures everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly if you're you know putting them in
vitro and Doing it that way if you stress
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's already stressed exactly
it's just like kill me please right and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can always Reculture it and you know
keep it rolling, but you're just adding
[SPEAKER_03]: more of that onto it right I'll always
refer to the first part of tissue culture
[SPEAKER_03]: as the proofing phase because You got to
make sure that everything that's going
[SPEAKER_03]: into culture is healthy enough to sustain
growth so I think that was a you know we
[SPEAKER_03]: we had cosmic on earlier, but he had to
jump out, but one of the things that he
[SPEAKER_03]: was talking about is the potential for
contamination when using a single Culture
[SPEAKER_03]: vessel for multiple X plants or multiple
meristematic tissue cultures just based on
[SPEAKER_03]: either the use of Improper aseptic
techniques improper cleaning practices
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to putting into culture so what are
some of the steps that you take to help
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce the Or to increase the viability of
your initial X plants when going directly
[SPEAKER_03]: from a mother population or a stock plant
population at a facility Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a so refer to a stage zero right
There's a lot of preparation you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: do with your mother plant to start If you
think endophytes that are in the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: you can remove a lot of those you know you
say a product with Like bio safe zero tall
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pulling it into the tissue and it can
kill a lot of these you know anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: things and Knock those down quite a bit
right Stuff you know Pythium when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythium goes all the way up, and it starts
getting limp on top If you add those and
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts straightening it up because it's
killing that in the tissue itself So if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having trouble with contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely start there Getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know just knocking as much down as you
can when you take your samples I Haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a huge Difference with the right
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always keep that mind in health or
subculture or everything Where I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: that tissue the best is obviously going to
be lower parts of the plant and If you
[SPEAKER_00]: think endogenous hormones It's whole
yation or the this photomorphogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: response right if it's in low light
conditions It's just going to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch towards that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hormones in there that are already
In the tissue so those always have a
[SPEAKER_00]: faster response as far as growth But
you're also getting thinner Little stock
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut So we can surface sterilize as much
as we want, but if it's had a really thick
[SPEAKER_00]: stock that you're trying to put Into the
agar you're not going to penetrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: kill Everything inside right that's a
really I go down this my like in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: Preciations are probably this big tiny
Remove all the tissue that's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to healthy growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you leave it on there,
there's it could be harboring harboring
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants that you might not see for
months Like it will just build and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf touching the side of a vessel and
then it's contaminated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose of this is like get rid of
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it will grow and just Be
really really healthy in in culture with
[SPEAKER_00]: the formulas things we've developed So you
start there get rid of the chances that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's contamination in deeper thicker
tissue It makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I stop you a quick question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean you're You're kind of blowing
my mind right now by saying that you
[SPEAKER_01]: should use the lower tissue on the plant
because What I've always been taught even
[SPEAKER_01]: from the people that taught me tissue
culture was that you want to use the top
[SPEAKER_01]: newest growth So are you saying that
that's not true that you know something on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom that may have been there for
longer and is thinner and You know
[SPEAKER_01]: stretched out is actually better parent
material than like the a pic, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant Yeah, that's what I
that's what I use and there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: sides to it right if you're taking a
Marist em You get that apex of the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are gonna be bigger up top Remember
you're cutting all that tissue off Right
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're way easier to dissect and isolate
is there bigger and you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: Aggressive kind of new cell growth cell
division and growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're putting in, you know node
node culture or just a shoot tip I Always
[SPEAKER_00]: take it from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think University of wealth came out with
a paper that's saying, you know subsequent
[SPEAKER_00]: subcultures They have a lower decline in
health from the basal stock if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking from that which really like those
low shoots that are Just coming off the
[SPEAKER_03]: stock on the bottom, right for sure And
there's we think of like UV radiation and
[SPEAKER_03]: how that can also damage genetics Within
any plant absolutely and or any living
[SPEAKER_03]: creature So anything that has a little bit
of a more shade response where it is
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to push a hormonal growth rather
than using The light directly on it to
[SPEAKER_03]: promote and drive the growth You're gonna
have a little bit of a greater potential
[SPEAKER_03]: for healthiest genetic tissue and this is
something that I feel like Just for a
[SPEAKER_03]: little clarification, you know,
like if you are doing clonal projects
[SPEAKER_03]: Propagation using a lower Branch may not
produce the most vigorous clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So using upper growth for clonal
propagation is usually the most
[SPEAKER_03]: advantageous simply because it does have a
lot more available photosynthates directly
[SPEAKER_03]: on site ready to be used because of the
photosynthetic process that's happening
[SPEAKER_03]: that close to the light, but when you're
exactly relying on photosynthesis to
[SPEAKER_03]: provide the plant with the carbohydrates
that needs For growth then something with
[SPEAKER_03]: a higher hormonal load and it does sound
like it would do a lot better in vitro
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yep, and you're not having to add
these extra hormones and you know And it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a big difference, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thin little little shoots that are
popping up ease way easier to sterilize
[SPEAKER_00]: like thoroughly sterilize so you're
confident it's not gonna Start growing in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a couple months down the line,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see if just a faster response But
that also has to do with formulations and
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see a dramatic difference So
if you just stick to just thin tissue that
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't been There's a lot of those top
pieces that you want to take regular
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or cuttings, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those big stick stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of go the opposite that doesn't it
doesn't feel like it makes sense But
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where I see the very most success
as far as Sterilizing and preventing
[SPEAKER_03]: contamination, you know that's that's an
awesome trick for people that are trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to get into this and and find success
early on because it's such a long process
[SPEAKER_03]: to go from even nodal culture to a An X
plant that you can then put back into
[SPEAKER_03]: rotation as either a mother or a
production plant I mean that it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: hard for some people to then lose all that
progress and and want to continue we've
[SPEAKER_03]: And see that even just with home growers
popping a seed and and getting some,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Thrips or some disease or just
powdery mildew or something that hinders
[SPEAKER_03]: their their overall grow and they just
don't want to do it again So limiting
[SPEAKER_03]: those little potentials for issue is so
huge and I would like you to touch on the
[SPEAKER_03]: the difference between nodal and meristem
tissue culture and what you Prefer to do
[SPEAKER_03]: first if you're going in to do genetic
preservation Would you would you start
[SPEAKER_03]: with nodal tissue culture or would you
Start with meristem and just to preface
[SPEAKER_03]: this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always thought that you go from Meris
or nodal to meristem while it's all in
[SPEAKER_03]: vitro so that you can have You do that
Zero Generation to really make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's The healthiest tissue possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it just be great to kind of hear
your opinion on whether you like to start
[SPEAKER_03]: with nodal or Meristem tissue culture and
why Sure, so When somebody's learning I
[SPEAKER_00]: just I always suggest start with nodal
culture get the process and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am saving something you know for
long-term storage or Keeping a clean copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do Meristem right if I pop it
from seed you should always do You know a
[SPEAKER_00]: node Because it hasn't been exposed to all
these other things and collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes and fungus and everything else
I try to do it early though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not having that full xylem and
you know things that Can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take one sterilize it keep a
clean copy in any other genetic that I
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in Meristem 100% Do you start with
Meristem I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yeah, so once you have a clean copy
right from Meristem that you can multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything coming out of there's clean
right and that's that's the the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a huge collection of genetics I
don't know where a lot of these came from
[SPEAKER_00]: or I do but you know the facility they
came from What they have whether you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I know it has a virus and I'll
take the same precautions if it I know it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have a virus you just you know be
safe and follow best practice and
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols and You'll prevent the spread
right because you could take something out
[SPEAKER_00]: of culture You did from Meristem and just
give it a virus like pretty quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But new genetics, you know, I got some of
my old stuff back the other day I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want some of the classics super lemon haze
golden goat things like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether to study or breed with doesn't
matter Meristem dissection that way I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: confident that it's clean and done
properly and once I have tissue in there I
[SPEAKER_00]: can pull as many of those out as I want
The difficult part with Meristem is the
[SPEAKER_00]: length of time maintenance checking them
making sure it's growing and That's
[SPEAKER_00]: something we've cut down dramatically like
rule of thumb people say about nine months
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't speak too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got to go home and make sure make
sure it's alive, but we you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can easily cut that in half or We're
looking at about three four months
[SPEAKER_03]: Potentially that rate of from Meristem to
like Like fully hardened off plant ready
[SPEAKER_03]: to go into production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep But that rate of growth and these are
this new formula just for this I still
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make sure that's healthy rate of
growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still not using tons of hormones or
anything like same, you know kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: approach that I use but You can have rapid
growth and have mutations and other
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that you definitely can't see
Right, especially if you're breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna look further into that at a
deeper level but if you start with
[SPEAKER_00]: Meristem and you know, it's clean and you
can feel confident in that then everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else you do from there is gonna be better
than What you had right because even a
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny little node that you can sterilize
You're still gonna still could harbor
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, you know, like a tiny tiny spore or
something You're not gonna see the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time the plant grows and Those
spores or contaminants grow inside as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the biggest piece because the
the stuff I've pulled out of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture from Meristem It is explosive
growth like and it's not too many hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because nothing else except the
plant's tissue is utilizing the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else You know you push it
into grow get a collection of these
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes and you know other things in
there, but That's where you're part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: name is the mothership labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get new sets of mother stock from this
system every quarter or however,
[SPEAKER_00]: however little you want And you just don't
have to worry they get extremely vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants high yields all the stuff
that people think of when when you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about tissue culture But you turn around
you're like we're not seeing that like why
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so Definitely start with Meristem To
practice and kind of dial things in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting Familiar with everything node
culture is just a great way to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: through tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get plenty of it Because once
you're comfortable and you can manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: these things and you you know what to look
for then Meristem is A lot easier to like
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor once you get it past that first
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's just the same stuff like
transfers clean them up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure they're they're healthy and
Becomes much easier, but if you start with
[SPEAKER_00]: Meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't done this before it's Let's
say it's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a difficult first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can do this The learning
curve again is just practice like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just get used to the motions and what
you're looking for and proper technique
[SPEAKER_00]: then The rest is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know well, it's pretty easy you know
some troubleshooting here and there but I
[SPEAKER_00]: want the stock that I grow and especially
stock that I breed with to be As clean as
[SPEAKER_00]: I can and as healthy as I can Just talking
about epigenetic pressures earlier on
[SPEAKER_00]: right those are heritable to the next
generation so You definitely start with as
[SPEAKER_00]: clean as you can until we get You know
more easier solutions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right to kind of reset these
things, but which I think will come I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: the technologies there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just crazy so for sure Gabby did you
have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did so you know I Like I said,
I have a hobby tissue culture lab and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: only done nodal tissue culture in the past
and I want to learn how to do Meristem and
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I went to the lab, you know the
other day took so much time to prep that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have time to do Meristem and I had
already taken all these clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I wanted to stick some in nodal if You
have a clone that's in nodal and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do Meristem off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you suggest doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: sanitization procedure again I Don't think
that's something that I'm thinking You
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get after well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you're I think you're thinking the
right way That's that's what we want like
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure it's possible that it's not
clean when you when you do a nodal tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and I was thinking you know
normally when you do nodal culture at
[SPEAKER_01]: least the first time you stick it in you
got to sterilize it after that if it
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't grown anything you just pull it out
divide it and put it in new media,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if I'm going from nodal to Meristem Do
you think it's important that I then again
[SPEAKER_01]: do that sanitization process?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you could technically right you
could let's get a thick piece of stem and
[SPEAKER_00]: during that process you cut through a stem
it gets something on there and gets onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the the cell tissue you're the Meristem
you want to remove Or the tip of your tool
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're placing it onto the medium,
then you could get it, but Really if you
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're removing anything that Those can
live in any way right it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: live in those The clump of cells that
you're removing so I think you'll be fine
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that The way I do I usually
sterilize from tissue, so it's healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapid growth that hasn't gone in in vitro
yet, and I'll sterilize those to put in
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can do it both ways yeah,
if you you know I have some I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: dissect when I get home that are just in
vessels they're still huge fill them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't have a copy that's Acclimated
and ready to go I don't I want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: the process and get you know get the rest
of my collection done Right so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily pull that out Under the microscope,
and it's again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just feeling comfortable we have some
methods that are fast easy and Overall
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate is what you want Biggest
suggestion if you get some if you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the dentist ask them for Some of their
tools most of the time they'll recycle
[SPEAKER_00]: them or send them back Somewhere that they
are the best for Marissa dissections.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of just peel those primordial
primordial structures off to expose that
[SPEAKER_00]: and Just take it right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of tools are we talking about so
those dental picks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're like the handles, and they
have like the tools in a different shape
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, so every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God best thing for Dissecting ever
like wow all right, that's it because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get in there with a knife oh Yeah,
it's it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about We get in there with the
blade like scalpel blade even number 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is like thinner It's still hard to
kind of sort through that That will
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not like ripping things off Like
yeah, why do you like peel it off these
[SPEAKER_00]: beliefs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll kind of like push them to the side
right and on both sides So it kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: opens up Then you can visually like see
the structure and where you're you're good
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into because after a little bit
you're like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what I'm cutting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like mashing things up right
Especially if it's on you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: dissection plate, so I hold mine straight
up in the air like this and I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: forceps and So it's sticking up in the
air, and I'll peel You know the primordial
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf and any structures to the side so you
can kind of see it It's way way easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another thing that takes
practice Right you do that ten million
[SPEAKER_00]: times right near your cruising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do one like five minutes and just
knock them out It's all in the prep work
[SPEAKER_00]: and like I have all my tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's your you get taught certain
things and you like humans just great
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like we have to have these tools
and this it's whatever works best for you
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a different hand shape or a
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know my elbow I got a bum elbow,
and you know you find a tool That's really
[SPEAKER_00]: effective that that works for you And just
use it you know so I got I got a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: dental tools I get him for five bucks from
the dentist if you buy a new they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 bucks you can autoclave them Some have
little tiny blades on the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know makes it much much easier And
another one is up to my dentist Every time
[SPEAKER_00]: I go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like I got like five more for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it to my clients and stuff like
Are your clients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to interrupt, but something that
I'm super interested in is What does
[SPEAKER_01]: mothership labs do like I know that you're
a tissue culture lab, but are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you selling tissue culture clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you teaching people how to do tissue
culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it called like when you just hold
all genetics like a repository?
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation like a bank yeah,
so We I build labs, so I design build labs
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much any scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we can do Fully automated robotic
tissue culture labs if you want you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend the money they exist and we
started off because you know I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: running big programs and breeding and
research and There's just a lot of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences and bad business we went
through in the This industry right and I
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up working with my current partner
Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's awesome and a Couple of those
experiences we went through and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: like we work really well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found he keeps me in the lab he says
And you know business development sales he
[SPEAKER_00]: does he's just amazing man the other The
stuff that I don't want to do right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not good at right And we started this
because we wanted to choose people to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with that had the same values and You know
vision that we do so we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: organically shaped to where we can do a
ton of different things But this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: way we can help people the most like in
the immediate term So coming out building
[SPEAKER_00]: labs and showing people like advanced
techniques, and that's you know developing
[SPEAKER_00]: formulas like here you go and we do all
the hard work just just go and Seeing them
[SPEAKER_00]: be successful When they're off when
they're on their own now we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliate lab we can just like perform a
communication right we can send each other
[SPEAKER_00]: clean genetics whenever and build each
other's catalogs and make crosses and It's
[SPEAKER_00]: been awesome, so the long-term vision is
breeding research more you know more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that we love to do and
Collaborate with other people that do that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have powerful tools and so we use all
of our Capabilities to create powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: tools that are easy to use and that you
can apply To make your help sustain the
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry because there's been a lot of
collapse Across the board right so like
[SPEAKER_00]: let's save these genetics like preserve
them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it So they're healthy,
and we're not having long-term issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have the real genetics stored And
I'll do sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just do it for Because you you run
into the trust thing too right like send
[SPEAKER_00]: me your genetics, and I'll hold them
That's why I started like building people
[SPEAKER_00]: labs right I the first version I just had
like a mobile kit that I piece together
[SPEAKER_00]: and show up be like I'll show you Tissue
culture is not hard Like and you show
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody the process and that's not that
hard like you can do it man like I got
[SPEAKER_00]: your back like let's go It's funny that
you say that I mean I want to If you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: will humor me for a second, I want to tell
a little story Yeah, do you know who Bill
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham is the guy who sells the the home
tissue culture kit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've heard yeah, I've heard for sure
so you know he gave me a kit and I kept it
[SPEAKER_01]: for over a year sealed in the box never
used it because I was intimidated and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just felt like I had to get ready you know
I had to build this sterile space and I
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said it was Intimidating and so one
day he comes over to my shop because I
[SPEAKER_01]: owned a hydro store and He comes to the
shop and he says that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just gonna do this and he already
had media prepared But he broke out the
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure cooker so we could make media and
then yeah It wasn't cannabis because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: my growth store, but we had scented
geraniums and redwood trees and We divided
[SPEAKER_01]: him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used a rubber made tough box turned on
its side with The front door of my store
[SPEAKER_01]: opening so like it was in my retail space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The door was opening and we put the plants
in there and Everything grew and we got
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very little if any contamination and
then after that I was so inspired I did
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture every day like if you came
into my store It's not like alcohol and
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach because I'm constantly spraying
this stuff doing a tissue culture But now
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ended up kind of in that same
situation for many years where I'm scared
[SPEAKER_01]: to do Maristem You know and I got you
covered man, and I'm just trying to like
[SPEAKER_01]: break that ceiling do it because I know
once I do it Then I'll repeat and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but doing it that first time it's
like It's it seems it seems so like and
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, it's kind of like passing it
forward right because Where I came from is
[SPEAKER_00]: like nobody To help me for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to like fight and scratch You got
into industry nobody was gonna share
[SPEAKER_00]: Information with you like that's my recipe
or I was like, all right How am I supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to do my job then right so?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to just fight against
that be like I'll tell you exactly how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this and what I'm doing I have suites
of SOPs like if you're successful Then I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe we will will be successful
together, you know But it's somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: showing me that It's I was like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's it isn't that it's like someone
teaching you how to grow weeds The first
[SPEAKER_01]: time too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's like it started you know,
and then you see it you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not that hard Yeah, and it started my
entire career path like learning like you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to learn in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay cool and Just surrounding
myself with People are way smarter than
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and learning to ask the right
questions because you find if you got Good
[SPEAKER_00]: people around you They that are educated
and you know, whatever subject if you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to them, they love to share that right and
I've been to laboratories where like Like
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to you know PhDs Like I've
dedicated my entire life to this and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those people end up just turning out
samples or having to run more business
[SPEAKER_00]: Than science, you know and their dream
when their little kid was to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist So you start like can you show
me this or what about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go home and do my homework and come back
be like, alright I ran into some more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions Like they're their eyes light
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like I know all about like he's
asking about this and That's what inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: me a long time ago to go down biotech and
all this and Otherwise it kind of dies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear tissue culture lab and the first
thing is like way too expensive you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole sterile room and all this stuff and
I mean if you're doing at this scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you want some preventatives in
place and But you don't need to do this if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at your house I built one of my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty crazy, but Maybe another I
ended up just building a lab my house so I
[SPEAKER_03]: could do all this do a lab some time of
your of your home lab Yeah video we just
[SPEAKER_00]: invited ourselves to your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just live stream you guys just pop in
whenever you want I got these AI cameras
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could do a lab tour and a Marissa
excision too if you want that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome Recently looking at
videos on YouTube trying to like figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out how to do it one thing I wanted to add
is you know in until recently you and
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you know and even Bill Graham and
some other people we had the guy from
[SPEAKER_01]: Kenomic come on educating people about
tissue culture and cannabis The guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing it didn't want to do it You
know like they want to keep their secrets
[SPEAKER_01]: and make you think that it's really hard
to do Because that's their business plan
[SPEAKER_01]: to like make money selling everybody the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me I Appreciate people like you
that are willing to share the knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: and educate people Like I said,
it's the same about growing weed like if
[SPEAKER_01]: we kept all the info back about how how to
grow weed It just holds the entire Like
[SPEAKER_01]: the universe back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to say thank you for being
willing to share all this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I've been very inspired already,
you know from from this conversation And
[SPEAKER_00]: again, like you might find something you
like dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just figure this out We go over together
and I could start using it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it to me and my partner Jay,
it's less about like Sometimes I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: show up at people's like I'm gonna knock
these out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so free because I love it,
but It's less about Gatekeeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge so I can make money and there's
the money will come and if I'm teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: people it to do this properly We all
advance in the center money to be made
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching people how to do it to and
building labs and Yeah, and I get when we
[SPEAKER_00]: build a network and and exchange
information It's less about me like
[SPEAKER_00]: providing mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like let's exchange information and
knowledge Continue to grow, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: well and some of those earlier companies
that did have these very proprietary
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue culture recipes for cannabis They
were evaluated at an extremely high At an
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely high valuation due to their
recipes and methodologies and so they were
[SPEAKER_03]: beholden to contracts to not release that
information out to anybody even if it was
[SPEAKER_03]: friends family somebody that was just
looking to get into tissue culture because
[SPEAKER_03]: they would They would void their
contractual obligations and their
[SPEAKER_03]: fiduciary responsibilities to these
investors where I think one of the recipes
[SPEAKER_03]: was evaluated at ten million dollars just
for the trade your recipe and That was you
[SPEAKER_03]: know five to ten years ago and that
company is now out of business because
[SPEAKER_03]: they realized that You can have this
awesome recipe But if you're not then
[SPEAKER_03]: sharing it with the community and helping
the community understand the value behind
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue culture There is no reason to do it
in the first place Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you know, I've heard so much bad
information or misinformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the information is like that's
what they learned and we're told Which is
[SPEAKER_00]: okay like I understand that too But the
work we did and like the focus work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so tired This entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it works and all these things
that you heard tissue culture can do is
[SPEAKER_03]: possible and Let's let's touch on one of
those actually really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to cut you off, but I feel like one
of the biggest controversies in Through
[SPEAKER_03]: the views of cannabis cultivators when it
comes to tissue culture right now is the
[SPEAKER_03]: removal of hops late and viroid through
Marist tissue culture and Yep,
[SPEAKER_03]: you and I were actually put in contact
with each other through our mutual
[SPEAKER_03]: connection at to me genomics Because
that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I had reached out to find
out more about hops late and viroid
[SPEAKER_03]: remediation because it is something where
some people will say there's no guarantee
[SPEAKER_03]: it can't happen and they've been doing
tissue culture for years or decades,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're caught I believe in a mindset
of Limitations where they don't think that
[SPEAKER_03]: something's possible because they just
haven't been able to do it yet What I
[SPEAKER_03]: always like to tell people, you know This
is also for people that have been growing
[SPEAKER_03]: for 30 years 40 years Cannabis and are
stuck in a specific set of ways where they
[SPEAKER_03]: say this is how I've always done it This
is how it works and I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to new methodologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already been doing this for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can Could something be better?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I feel like there are people
pigeonhole themselves and a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: mentalities unfortunately, but I was put
in direct contact with you because of your
[SPEAKER_03]: ability that you've shown to remove hop
late and viroid and so I'd like to pick
[SPEAKER_03]: your brain a little bit about that where
you found success and How that success has
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of been able to been proven out over
time Sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a hot topic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, when you first reach out about
like a Potential client and I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: he's asking asking a lot of questions But
it was great to connect you're asking the
[SPEAKER_00]: right questions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was uh, it's it's refreshing in a
lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as everything is right the world is
it's more complex than Can you remove it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you not right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different with different genetics
There is the mechanical removal part right
[SPEAKER_00]: removing the The the cells at the the
apical dome Not connected to the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: system, which a lot of these things can be
moved through the tissue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one part of it, but they I believe
there's been some instance where They have
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred through other avenues,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know through these cellular mechanisms
and I group that It is like more research
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be needs to be done to be
understood but there's some genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: are knock it out in the first try and be
like I'm the best there ever was at DC
[SPEAKER_00]: some genetics extremely just a Pain to to
do that with it's not all the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's like the variety of how these
things evolved in the tissue down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular mechanisms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all the same cannabis has a
Very different plant in some ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so Starting there the methodology and
treatments and there's a variety of those
[SPEAKER_00]: available, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use broad Anti-virals you can do
there's a ton of things you can apply To
[SPEAKER_00]: help prevent cross-contamination and and
have that be more successful Rule of thumb
[SPEAKER_00]: is I think I told you too is like 50% of
the samples Right is what you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect but there's also those,
you know those outliers were like none of
[SPEAKER_00]: those came out clean or all of them so
going down to the techniques So I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys pulled like cold treatments and
you know a lot of different ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: approach it the cells don't know about
cold treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you briefly touch on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can Basically take your you know,
I'll take a sample this big right just
[SPEAKER_00]: your your tissue and Protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a kind of step process to you
know, protect it store it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator and I know some people have
gone way colder than that, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically really really cold for a short
amount of time or refrigerator for we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do like two months or so I've adapted that
into using some synthetic seed techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: as well to protect those Protect those
organs and make sure we're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality of the cells to grow But
essentially you're just slowing everything
[SPEAKER_00]: down It always starts with the sample that
you take Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember the photomorphogenic responses
you can get a plant to stretch out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quick using far-red light Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not stretch that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing really fast then take your X
plant So already you've either limited or
[SPEAKER_00]: diluted as much as you can right from the
bottom of that plant Simply viral you're
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking links to this metabolism
and growth So if you can just stretch it
[SPEAKER_00]: out and if you know far-red light you can
get that to happen pretty quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: right and start there You're already ahead
So at least a viral load and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else you're working with Cold storage does
kind of same thing and I've heard heat
[SPEAKER_00]: cold It's all I think needs to be
Evaluated further to get like real Truth
[SPEAKER_00]: behind some of these things but because
we're looking at just a mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: separation if it's not able to get into
those cells Why does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which could it could Get into those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of that I think is Just an
attempt to kind of slow everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not spreading into the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna just dissect anyway So
currently I just use that far-red light
[SPEAKER_00]: which you get isolated spectrums of that
take your your X plant and do a proper
[SPEAKER_00]: dissection and that There's techniques
which I'll go over when we're in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go over with all that stuff for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a huge difference Right because
if I'm sitting there smearing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know HLBD all over the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm plating up and so on so forth You got
to prevent that and that's I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest part we could isolate that
efficiently I use ocular scissors and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know for eye surgeries things like that
You find the right tool or the best tool
[SPEAKER_00]: for the job So you go to the eye doctor
and get their used tools to see this is it
[SPEAKER_00]: you're catching on right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got to schedule appointments Go
pick up pick up tissue culture supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good All right, just make a list of
all the doctors that we got to grab their
[SPEAKER_01]: recyclables from Go search in that
dumpster behind the building to see like
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some ocular scalpels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Funny enough the last tool was like a
hyperdermic or hyperdermic needle That you
[SPEAKER_00]: could just because it has the sharp end
that you can pull that off without
[SPEAKER_00]: touching anything Other tissue on there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have a Clean pull and then
you're able to just remove it and just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of plate it like a sharpener spoon
I'm a rookie but it's funny that you say
[SPEAKER_01]: that because I watched a video and It
literally looked like he didn't cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: meristem out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He popped it out It's like he just
wouldn't anyone like this like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know first He peeled it open a little
bit and then he just popped it out I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made that look too simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do that in slow motion or it
needs to be slow motion and and even
[SPEAKER_01]: zoomed in more than yeah microscope was
showing because Yeah, it's only technique
[SPEAKER_00]: right and if you think about just tissue
in general If it's waterlogged and been
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in, you know, you just sterilize
it and you went took a break that tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna be different than You know you
picture like asparagus in an ice bath ice
[SPEAKER_00]: bath, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still crispy and you can kind of Snap
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's sitting in there in your
Sterilization solution and you it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: it's absorbing liquid It's gonna be a
little more gummy and hard to kind of pop
[SPEAKER_00]: off, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those things is where you
fine-tune those skill sets and don't you
[SPEAKER_01]: you start I'm sorry, but don't you isn't
that part of the process like you put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Water and you and you soak it and clean it
then you put it in bleach and whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you soak it in water again Aren't
they always gonna be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Waterlogged by that point No, no,
not if you're just efficient with with
[SPEAKER_00]: that process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a and I can run I think the most I
did in one day was like 22 I Would never
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that it was it was painful But I
dialed this in because it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient for people to use it right goes
back to that concept 50 mil tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a flat I just pull it up fill it to
that line and Add the tissue cap it
[SPEAKER_00]: orbital shaker for five minutes And that's
just with water washing particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: residues off for water in between 20 or
poly sorbate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty amount and then I add bleach water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's five minutes on the orbital shaker
another five minutes for me to set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepare to start pulling tissue,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way it's not getting over
sterilized or over saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like Empty them out rinse and I'm
already starting to pull tissue off So you
[SPEAKER_00]: get in a rhythm like start with enough
samples to where you get through it And
[SPEAKER_00]: you start making it more efficient with
like 50 mil tubes or like whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sanitizing too much at a time
because then it's just sitting there in a
[SPEAKER_01]: water or exactly Yeah, so I stick to I
made that mistake the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes huge difference, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was only doing nodal but still
I'm gonna Yeah, it's all flimsy and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I usually capping it like six different
genetics at a time now Just because I'm I
[SPEAKER_00]: got lots of other things I'm doing And I
can knock those out get them in culture Be
[SPEAKER_00]: good, you know But start with one you can
do I use 50 mil tubes just eat and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not wasting too too much liquid or having
to manage too much liquid, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're juggling like big jars and Space
yeah So you can just get a 50 mil tube
[SPEAKER_00]: rack and shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have an orbital shaker and But
by the time I get to that six sample or
[SPEAKER_00]: six cultivar It's still good to go if I
start pushing it do like 12 at once the
[SPEAKER_00]: last one I'm starting to do is like
getting flimsy and It'll still grow but we
[SPEAKER_00]: want just the healthiest high-quality
tissue going in right, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know as you I do a lot of like
lean 5s training and process procedure
[SPEAKER_00]: optimization stuff the laboratories and
Operations and that's why I broke it down
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's easier to train People pick
that up easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like less steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steps make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not having to do unnecessary
things we've tested them and You can get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the final step of dissection faster and
and start moving So then you have a guy in
[SPEAKER_00]: having to spend all day in a lab to get
five Clean samples and throwing out
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't I'm like I haven't seen
contamination a long time, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome just be just solid best practice
and just follow the steps and You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just mass produce initiations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess That's awesome and just get fast
just the mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go back to the HLVD a lot of those
things are still valid right best practice
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency because If you're smearing
viruses all over stuff, that's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right Those first two steps are very
important and have done really well as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as success getting that stretched out
piece Hopefully that's outgrowing or
[SPEAKER_00]: diluting some of that to some extent and
I've heard people say that Outgrows HLVD
[SPEAKER_00]: and culture right and that's I Wouldn't be
confident in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tested it, but I wouldn't be
confident And the mechanical removal you
[SPEAKER_00]: can always put broad-spectrum antibiotics
stuff like that in your your media plate
[SPEAKER_00]: rib ovarian or there's a bunch of them you
can do but As soon as you get that growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's I don't you're looking at surface
contact, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have antibiotics put it on
there and maybe you'll kill some when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: contacting that but it's gonna start
growing Unless that is getting pulled into
[SPEAKER_00]: the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't see that being effective
either, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, I mean it's really Case-by-case
basis I would say and when people ask me
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I mean, there's the truth This
is what I've seen and I'm trying to study
[SPEAKER_00]: this more at a deeper level So I can give
you the you know a better answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the reality is like there's there
needs to be more research I see on average
[SPEAKER_00]: about 50 50 percent success rate So I do
twice as many samples depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: many I want 50 percent success rate is
great Yeah, some people that's their
[SPEAKER_03]: entire tissue culture success rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're getting that with hops late
and viroid, that's crazy That's extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: successful dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you know, I wanted to To give an
analogy again And so kind of what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about is it reminds me of cancer
So for instance with cancer, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they cut it out, right but There's still a
chance that they didn't get it all out and
[SPEAKER_01]: that it hasn't you know And then you got
to go and and do it again, you know And so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same thing with tissue and
actually with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they have a better
chance of removing cancer or hop late and
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid but the bottom line is you have to
do the tissue culture and then you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: test and then you have to do it again and
even if you test you might have to test it
[SPEAKER_01]: again down the line or Because it's just
hard to know if it's gone, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I think they undetected cured of
cancer and Then years later it comes back
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was still inside of them
somewhere speaking on testing and and the
[SPEAKER_03]: length of time from your Zero generation
in tissue culture from Maristem where
[SPEAKER_03]: you're aiming where the aim is to remove
hops late and viroid what is the furthest
[SPEAKER_03]: out you've then tested say a Plant that
has fully come out of tissue culture is a
[SPEAKER_03]: mother plant or a stock plant at a
facility that Was cleaned up, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they removed all their hops late and
viroid plants, but they sent it out to be
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue culture they then In took those
genetics again and started following
[SPEAKER_03]: better practices to help reduce the
potential for hops late and viroid So
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the longest then that you've been
able to go back and test something that
[SPEAKER_03]: test?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tested positive for hops late and before
tissue culture and then tested negative
[SPEAKER_03]: out of tissue culture was was there ever
something that you found, you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: after like 15 months like there shouldn't
have been a Contamination problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it did test for hops late And again,
or have you seen that if you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: potential for contamination if it's not
being contaminated that it's been able to
[SPEAKER_03]: just sustain health and Zero viral
pressure after yeah, what's what's that
[SPEAKER_03]: time span you've been able to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, that's great question because
a lot of people assume like here's your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from Maristem culture It tested
negative You're good to go and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not the case, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: because The nature of the virus itself The
plant as it gets older and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism starts moving bigger root
system It's pushing all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: around the viral load increases Testing in
itself the LOD so the level of detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only so low that we can Identify it
as the virus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be in the piece of tissue
that we took it might and that's why you
[SPEAKER_00]: see testing requirements like take some of
This and a lot of it's in the root root
[SPEAKER_00]: system that we can test for it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they're that little You might not
notice it or detect anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I Might and I'll never tell you like
Put this in your clean grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because six months down the road all of
your plants could have it and it'll be my
[SPEAKER_00]: fault and I'm not gonna I'm not that guy
so I would say six months And there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are far more qualified to to
speak on this then than I am They're
[SPEAKER_00]: studying these fire like to me and though,
you know but from my knowledge and my You
[SPEAKER_00]: know ask asking people and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say like six months Eight months
down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would still test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I'm paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it spreading, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's this big I would say,
you know, like a teen size plant when it
[SPEAKER_00]: Has a fully developed root system and it's
in that final environment I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: where you know hotter temperatures
humidity like you're gonna you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that out I would say that's when
you can feel more confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, okay this thing's it's good
to go By then I would already have
[SPEAKER_00]: subcultures in there or new copies to
where like alright We're clean then like
[SPEAKER_00]: release all those subcultures that way you
have the numbers coming back into your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden Instead of just waiting for tests
to come back and then you have one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to start cloning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure So that's the their strategy behind
that Not like here's your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, test it in six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back to me It's like here's your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 50 of these coming So if we pass
that test you got 50 new moms coming or
[SPEAKER_00]: how many you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's how far out have you been able
to test like from clonal progeny and have
[SPEAKER_03]: negative Test results or negative in the
sense of that it no longer shows hops late
[SPEAKER_03]: and viroid after removing it from that
specific Cultivar how long have you been
[SPEAKER_03]: able to see it test negatively for I think
the opposite question is more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that I mean I can test it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have qPCR gel electrophoresis everything
so I use that to just validate my process
[SPEAKER_00]: like uh This isn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a change And that's what we want
right the biggest issue is Here's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, people give me their favorite
genetic for their brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like happy to clean it up Putting
it right back into a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just filled with viruses,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and I see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like awesome We get bigger and all
this we like you bite those first couple
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna perform way better But you're
not solving solving the issue so They
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have proper cleaning Proper SOP's in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and and you know, yep, you should
always assume that you have Viroid and the
[SPEAKER_01]: floors all practices to not spread it You
know, it's just kind of like safe sex with
[SPEAKER_01]: random people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know like yeah You're not seeing
herpes doesn't mean she doesn't have it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or other STDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you Got a careful and that's a place
like this, right and this You see the logo
[SPEAKER_00]: they gave me a new hat lab roots Why we
are working with companies like this we
[SPEAKER_00]: can flush your entire facility out Right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much different picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Start harvesting those rooms at like
we'll schedule as these Clean plants come
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a whole room ready you harvest
a room And rotate clean it sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your first clean set Just don't
don't touch it like clean room style like
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go in there new scissors and as they
rotate out You're just flushing your
[SPEAKER_00]: entire facility out with your own
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do do that and that's what I see
the next phase of Getting some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things restored, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a restoration project for
the industry, man because there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: good genetics that I definitely don't want
to lose or because they can be studied or
[SPEAKER_00]: they could be used for breeding or and and
have these kind of varieties that That are
[SPEAKER_00]: just phenomenal there But tools like this
is like we flush your whole facility out
[SPEAKER_00]: You're way more successful and you have
it's almost like another chance It just
[SPEAKER_00]: tests anything you have a quarantine
protocol protocol before bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: something In your facility, right or just
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got we got some awesome genetics,
too So there's always the the functional
[SPEAKER_00]: tools of tissue culture, but then there's
a strategy on how to to apply it So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and you're getting you like
getting the results, right and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big piece I see a lot of these places
missing is like if I install a lab you
[SPEAKER_00]: could flush out your entire facility You
can you know start generating enough stock
[SPEAKER_00]: You have just run I don't recommend
propagation micro propagation Unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: know exactly what you're doing and you
know how to measure it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I always take the a chunk from
lean 5s is like to make define analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: improve on define measure analyze improve
control Right and you stick to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply it just to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like doing dishes saying it Just
haunts me in my dreams, but there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: I see j poking out here One thing man the
way you do everything Yeah, so the
[SPEAKER_00]: practical application like we have Some of
our other partners say like group of just
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing scientists We're gonna protoplast
fusion labs and you we create perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids by fusing cells together Cross
species hybrids we can do so We're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have to do another episode We're gonna try
and reel it back in a little bit here
[SPEAKER_03]: because it sounds like we're going to need
to do another episode So we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll introduce you to Raquel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's from This is her lab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say hi Hello, very impressive Yeah,
they're building some some awesome stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: out here, but very yeah, we love to
connect you to your game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you some air sim No dissection
training, whatever man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you in the lab remotely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome Or if you guys come to
Colorado if you're you're always welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I have to go just running
anything I can help with man super nice
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting you and Sounds good man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining us Gabby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a great talk Cool See, I mean so far
we've really touched on I feel like some
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects of the tissue culture side of
cannabis that a lot of people Do find very
[SPEAKER_03]: hard to wrap their brain around and to
There's there's not an entry-level Tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture, you know, like it you kind of
have to jump in You can't just get your
[SPEAKER_03]: feet wet you got to go all the way in Yep,
and you've you've touched on a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: those different aspects that really do
help support like you've like in your In
[SPEAKER_03]: your mission statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're you're wanting to support what's
already here within the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: and use this tool and this technology to
continue that support so that people can
[SPEAKER_03]: be more successful or You know find their
own niche within the market that helps
[SPEAKER_03]: them succeed Like for instance for my the
farm that I help manage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a huge outdoor plot and we grow
over a hundred different crops cultivars
[SPEAKER_03]: in that outdoor plot each year we also
have an indoor space and the indoor space
[SPEAKER_03]: only can get up to 22 21 to 22 harvests
per year and we're typically running only
[SPEAKER_03]: between 1 and 6 cultivars in there per
year so we can't even get through our full
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic library in a year and The
maintenance of mother plants and stock
[SPEAKER_03]: plants is expensive It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tedious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing that I find to be one of
the hardest aspects of maintaining a large
[SPEAKER_03]: stock plant population is the constant
need for organization the constant need
[SPEAKER_03]: for Proper techniques within the cloning
process that if something if you get a
[SPEAKER_03]: hiccup it throws your schedule off you
need to then retake clones it throws off
[SPEAKER_03]: if you only have a certain amount of space
with like we're a small farm we have
[SPEAKER_03]: limited space so it's it's hard to
maintain these Different populations also
[SPEAKER_03]: with a small labor force Yeah,
but tissue culture It does seem as though
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a lot of opportunity in a lot of
different aspects of cultivation that Can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of help bring?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis cultivation overall a few steps
forward Yeah, definitely so with your
[SPEAKER_03]: experience and like I said before we're
gonna have to come back to do another
[SPEAKER_03]: episode especially When you're back home
in your lab because I want to go over your
[SPEAKER_03]: your different breeding practices and some
of those projects that you've done I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: love to hear a little I love breeding
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of the like real fun hobby
aspects of cannabis cultivation I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like that anybody can get into and they
can really create something that's really
[SPEAKER_03]: unique to them It's almost like having
having that awesome family recipe that you
[SPEAKER_03]: share with people and they're like,
oh my god That's the best food in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you make it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've just been doing this forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like attached to the the plant,
you know So like I was saying though,
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to do another episode talk about
your breeding talk about your actual home
[SPEAKER_03]: growing practices currently where you're
keeping these genetics alive outside of
[SPEAKER_03]: culture because The in vitro culture,
you know, that's one aspect of it But you
[SPEAKER_03]: still then need to have the ability to
have those plants in a actual growing
[SPEAKER_03]: environment yep ex vitro and The different
techniques and stuff that you use there in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to maintain a certain health I feel
like when you're looking at it through a
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific lens of these are either Going
to be for tissue culture or they're coming
[SPEAKER_03]: out of tissue culture and I need to
maintain a specific amount of health that
[SPEAKER_03]: Ends up leading to really refined
cultivation practices really absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental lighting irrigation
practices that Are almost they're so
[SPEAKER_03]: essential for actual cultivation of
cannabis for Flower production that I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like we'd be able to teach a lot of people
more When we dive back into that but
[SPEAKER_03]: considering you've had a lot of experience
in The illicit market back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were able to translate that into what
sounded like helping with different
[SPEAKER_03]: medical and earlier Programs within say
Colorado and around those areas and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you also Continue with your home growing
and your breeding and all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: practices and aspects of the industry that
you're in I feel like you would be a great
[SPEAKER_03]: person to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you want to see the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Change or develop in the next five to ten
years that you feel as though we're
[SPEAKER_00]: missing currently As a less there's a lot
there you know because I Started at least
[SPEAKER_00]: professional cultivation and management
and you know CEO Restructuring other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's programs all that stuff So I've
seen a lot and I was able to ask a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these questions and get different
perspectives, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see Really, you know best
practice stuff that a lot of that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out to especially with the viral Virus and
be like if you just follow this it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep Contamination out you keep pests and
things like that to create a clean
[SPEAKER_00]: product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one testing Testing is all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a full lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd send our stuff out for compliance
We'd run the same samples on our equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: and another lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So standardizing that because if it does
become medicine we need to know that Those
[SPEAKER_00]: results are reliable and we can use it as
such, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes also also into What genetics are
truly, you know, everyone's renaming
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll find a good cut and they'd rename
it How do we build around that to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much How do we how are we
sure that if I go to this dispensary or
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know wherever that evolves to and
I know I need medicine How do I know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plant that is helping me right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's be Application of so
pharmacogenomics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a human genome Some of the groups
I'm working with is to connect those
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces to see We could both smoke the same
joint and I'm freaking out and you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel great I love this our body just
like all these plants are different our
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors our brains are formed
differently our experience has shaped the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of those right we know about
the methylation and how That is an aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of just how life Evolves and continues to
grow So how do we unravel all that to
[SPEAKER_00]: where?
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand the application for
medicinal purposes and standardize those
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces and I would also like to help like
Because we've had to create hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs, right classical
methodology I Couldn't use but I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow fields for statistical analysis and
Because of regulation and compliance or it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just not cost-effective How do we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Better access for research and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of those are starting to
evolve as well But if we're not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow these plants to study them and
improve without breaking the bank Then
[SPEAKER_00]: that side is not going to continue to
evolve either right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so we we're all part of a group
different groups to push these things
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and contribute So I think if you
have your own breeding program You have
[SPEAKER_00]: unique genetics for your brand that we can
fingerprint ID those at the genetic level
[SPEAKER_00]: so we know that's yours and That adds more
power to the brand and builds Their
[SPEAKER_00]: customer base and so breeding programs and
more education behind How you can do this
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively in a controlled way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep going but a lot a lot more the more
the molecular marker assistant selection
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to Truly pinpoint some of
these things I feel like tech
[SPEAKER_03]: biotechnology I You know it feels it
sounds like we can wrap up a lot of what
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd like to see in the better
application of the information we have
[SPEAKER_03]: available and putting those practices into
use and not Not falling back to these old
[SPEAKER_03]: You know quote-unquote bro science ways of
growing cannabis and producing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's still the illicit market,
you know Like taking this and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: truly quantify and qualify the different
aspects of the cannabis plant how it
[SPEAKER_03]: interacts with the human endocannabinoid
system and Trying to use proper studies
[SPEAKER_03]: and and test samples and test groups and
different populations of users to help
[SPEAKER_03]: Understand how things affect certain
people how we can then take that data and
[SPEAKER_03]: give it to other people so that they don't
have to Be a guinea pig for their own
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal needs Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I talked to groups that are You
know one has a daughter one has a brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lots of friends I've seen some that
like they've Steered their cancer like my
[SPEAKER_00]: best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had severe lung cancer and it's
completely gone Wow, why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Change some of these people's lives and
have a positive impact from what we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: of us are just really good at I know some
cultivators that are far better than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bad neck and back now I'll be
growing weed for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how can we just organize together and
Share more information because I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a huge start right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being able to freely Talk about
what's working and how we can work
[SPEAKER_00]: together And as a company, you know,
my partner I were like if we could pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: bills and just keep moving It'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on powerful tools for
breeding and biotechnology and connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: These other networks so We can at least
contribute, you know to that but it's I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't just be you know, we So I love to
see people just kind of like it used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: man like growers growers unite with kids
Yeah and be able to make positive change
[SPEAKER_00]: because it it is evolving and is going to
continue to to evolve and change and it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be just the people that have a
ton of money that Is allowed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so anything we can do to help For you know
your viewers or your your crews anything
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure these guys here are in the same
mindset this company lab routes to like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're we're hoping to use a lot of their
experience to scale and and have some some
[SPEAKER_00]: power behind this too, but it's still
gonna take work to create a model that We
[SPEAKER_00]: can see within the the community and the
people, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean that's why I call this show the
way we grow because it's It has two
[SPEAKER_03]: meanings, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to teach people how to grow
commercially home growing hobby tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture Anything in between I want to make
sure that people have the tools at their
[SPEAKER_03]: disposal and the resources they need to
access knowledge that has been withheld or
[SPEAKER_03]: gate kept for decades but Not only do I
want to help people learn how to grow I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to grow the community as a whole And
I want to grow the collaborative effort
[SPEAKER_03]: between different growers and people that
are in cannabis and cannabis adjacent
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses because Just like any other
industry that has really taken off it
[SPEAKER_03]: required immense amounts of collaboration
between those who were working to really
[SPEAKER_03]: progress the field in a way that they
thought helped the most people possible
[SPEAKER_03]: and Yep people like yourself who are out
there trying to help implement best
[SPEAKER_03]: practices and remove different stigmas
from practices that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: controversial or argued about ad nauseum
You you're so valuable for the community
[SPEAKER_03]: and for making sure that we do continue to
grow as a whole That that's why I have
[SPEAKER_03]: this podcast That's why I want to get
people on here like yourself and get these
[SPEAKER_03]: stories told and get this information out
there because now people can reach out to
[SPEAKER_03]: you knowing that you have this background
and You know, I keep saying it we got to
[SPEAKER_03]: get back into another episode to talk more
about your home growing because some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the things that I do to impart the
information of is, you know pitfalls for
[SPEAKER_03]: home growers what you can teach new
growers Where you found success in your
[SPEAKER_03]: home growing failures in your home grow
and how you learned from that and those
[SPEAKER_03]: are all typically things that I touch on
but we're already kind of butting up on
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I feel like this would be a good
ending place So I'm gonna actually just
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of ran it in really quick And wrap it
up with a few rapid-fire questions that
[SPEAKER_03]: are always really fun to hear from someone
like yourself You're you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a professional operating at a high
level within the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you still love cannabis So what's your
favorite strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Man, that's I knew that was coming too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it If if I got the And this is my
older brother's friend long long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it since man The Afghani
and Northern Lights that he was bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the Afghani and And yet he
brought Afghani and Northern Lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: those are just grown to perfection Other
than that, there's some that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on that They're just phenomenal
because I'm breeding them kind of for me
[SPEAKER_00]: but also as a parental line for you know,
large flowers and some of these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a mazar Blueberry that I worked
for a while Wow DJ shorts blueberry sure
[SPEAKER_00]: then a chem 91 a bunch of chem 91 lines
and crosses Chem 91 Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gee grew for a while and then across
those to get hybrid vigor and Some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those are just unbelievable man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow We actually have a short on in a week
or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: What dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some f5 Blueberry that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, it's such a tight-knit
community that it's really interesting to
[SPEAKER_03]: see how quickly Things can happen when you
connect with one person and how closely
[SPEAKER_03]: they might be tied to someone else that
you've connected with and you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like it's amazing five degrees of
separation is almost it's only like two or
[SPEAKER_03]: three in the cannabis industry It's really
it's really fascinating hiding behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out low-key high-tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just Stay in the shadows just doing
you know, whatever but after talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: you I was like man this like I Want to be
a part of this because that like we
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like I want to use my my
abilities in exchange knowledge and help
[SPEAKER_00]: support and because it changed my life,
you know, and hopefully I can least
[SPEAKER_00]: inspire and Could just change the
direction of somebody's path or build into
[SPEAKER_00]: something much bigger, which that's that's
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you got a few one from back
in the day your buddy grew you got some
[SPEAKER_03]: ones that you're working on now and So the
next question of course is who's your
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite breeder of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Well, I have favorite breeders for
different reasons like some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky guys they'll just kind of like
smell the wind, you know, and they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a good crop like those guys
because they have some stuff that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't even have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, it's just weed like man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best weed I've ever seen And I
just love the I love that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pick what's they select what's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Best to them and their family and there's
so much meaning behind that Then other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, I don't know man, it's Because I
have I've had such a huge collection for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long that I've just brought my own
breeding lines and stuff, but You said I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say like some of the old sub cool
stuff It was really exciting Just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: turf the profile like vortex and some of
these that I used to get back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had some of his collection left to
that I need to pop Person to say for his
[SPEAKER_00]: his vortex For to the the baby poop smells
man Other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of talented breeders
that are breeding for you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that with the I just picture them
as isolated populations almost and I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of that is just bottlenecked
and Being changed, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something I have some really crazy like
different genetics that Maybe we could
[SPEAKER_00]: collab and start You know expanding the
gene pool to get more unique things and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that There's just a ton of I
can't even keep up with them these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just in the lab Just focusing on what
I'm doing most of the time I feel that and
[SPEAKER_00]: I let you know the Guys are just making
their own crosses because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's Because that's where I
started, you know Like it's special to
[SPEAKER_00]: them and when I'm able to smoke or grow
that I think that has the most meaning to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, you know, it's not like a shame or I
don't care about any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about the connection and The
experience with the people and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that that ties it together, you know It
sounds like you're a fan of anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding with passion and an intent in
mind rather than a quick buck Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's put some some biotechnology and you
know high-level stuff behind it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said all of a sudden like I'll you
extract DNA once you're like that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not that hard Yeah, and maybe they
can have some of the opportunities that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was gifted, you know, just But that's what
that's why I got into this that's why what
[SPEAKER_00]: excited me and what I wanted to pursue and
it just evolved and I kept going and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning and I was only be able to do that
because I was just open and Willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn, you know and continue learning so I
wish that upon everybody for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your most memorable cannabis
related experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man There's a little long life
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um It's the guy that brought over the
Afghani nor the lights right and my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends gonna hear this and just start
rolling right It does when you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had the flat we like the You know just
move this and so you brought all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's not we'd like that's
just fake like looks crazy and Loaded up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bong.

like the one that I would never forget is
[SPEAKER_00]: embarrassing but So I had to be cool back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep I mean, there's so many memories along
the way though that I I'm sure I'll think
[SPEAKER_00]: of man.

gravity bong hit before just Going from
[SPEAKER_03]: the bucket standing up hitting it and then
just standing there and being like I held
[SPEAKER_03]: this for too long.
