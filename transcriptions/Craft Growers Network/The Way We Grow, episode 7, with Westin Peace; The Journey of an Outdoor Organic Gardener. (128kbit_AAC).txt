[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to another episode of
the way we grow podcast today our guest is
[SPEAKER_00]: at Weston underscore peace on Instagram He
is an outdoor organic home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your host Nick wolf So Weston,
how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean you're one of the The most
prolific outdoor home growers that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: of on their subreddit that we are both
moderators of the our slash craft
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana subreddit and I Feel like you
always take a lot of time and effort to
[SPEAKER_00]: put into your outdoor crop each year But
you know, how's life going in the
[SPEAKER_00]: offseason in the offseason?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me arguing myself about trimming and
starting to think about what changes I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make next year and how I got a
couple months and If I do want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: changes, you know what I'm gonna do and
how I'm gonna implement it but normally
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just trimming and kind of Brainstorm
about what's gonna happen next year For
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel that I feel like it's like
this time of year is always the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: year that at like a commercial level we
are looking at genetic acquisition and
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to plot out Where we're gonna
plant the different genetics based on
[SPEAKER_00]: their flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have the ability to measure
Map it out based on their flower
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation because we'll have some that'll
start You know two to up to four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks before the rest And they still only
need 65 to 70 days of flower So that's two
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't want to be running all
around the garden that like all the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that good fish early is here The next in
the net so you don't have people
[SPEAKER_01]: scrambling around that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Absolutely So what in the in your
garden this year upcoming?
[SPEAKER_00]: What what do you have planned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you've already
started to look into?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been as you know on the craft group
hitting up all of the grommies on there
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to start doing genetics from the
craft group solely Would be is my main
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool because normally I buy clones
and I have a reputable source and I do
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate them and like them,
but it would be cool to start putting up
[SPEAKER_01]: for instead of growing, you know Things
from giant breeders start hitting up all
[SPEAKER_01]: the homies and started growing,
you know within the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's That's a good idea and I
I'm kind of stoked about doing it How many
[SPEAKER_00]: how many times have you ran from seed
outside versus from clone it do you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: as though it's like a pretty even split or
No, not even I would rather do clones Just
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know what you're getting and
every plants gonna be the same so season
[SPEAKER_01]: got it my garden now I'm on season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just finished season four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So season three I did all seeds Except for
maybe two or three plants and I was super
[SPEAKER_01]: stoked with some of them and I was less
stoked with some of The other ones and
[SPEAKER_01]: also the variation and finishing time I'd
rather have two or three that I know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna finish all at the same time rather
than having you know 15 different plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that are skewed across the finishing lines
and like also you get into where like You
[SPEAKER_01]: notice certain plants have specific needs
Well, I'm not here all I'm not here all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and I have to have something that
I can kind of get into a routine on if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can figure out two plants You know fairly
quickly in the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier than me trying to play it by
ear on 15 different, you know Jenna,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know 15 different splits for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean especially because For all those
listeners that don't know you use raised
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fabric pods for your for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a bunch of pictures,
but I do I use raised pots I use fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: pots was pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a grapple base under each one of
them and this last year I moved up to 200
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pots, but yeah, I used I used
raised pots Off the ground and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: buffer between this between the ground
soil and the bottom of the pot I found
[SPEAKER_01]: that in rainy seasons that your pot
touches the ground Especially if you live
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere where water is gonna be running
down like the way our property is laid out
[SPEAKER_01]: It will run off the hill and come down and
run through the garden That they will just
[SPEAKER_01]: be soaking water up if it rains for a week
You know even lightly the ground gets wet
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they're constantly wicking
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kills your ability to water Very
much because you got to keep the top kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of wet but then you can't feed and you
can't Like you want to do something the
[SPEAKER_01]: pots already saturated and you got a you
can't it kind of slows your ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a move That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool application of using gravel
for like almost like a raised water table
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're getting it outside of the
zone of the flooding that's coming down
[SPEAKER_01]: through your property there No,
you live when you see it a couple years
[SPEAKER_01]: and you may you know, you know kind of
fine-tune it you see what you see I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know the first year that I was gonna
happen and then you see it and then By
[SPEAKER_01]: then I wanted to run the life of my last
pots out in soil And then so when I moved
[SPEAKER_01]: up and switched then I went and did and
what had made those changes nice Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to come back to your growing style,
but I want to find out first in your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing journey What were some of the
first plants that you ever grew whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: be cannabis or otherwise, you know We've
had some people on here where cactus was
[SPEAKER_00]: their first plant that their grandma gave
them or something and then some people
[SPEAKER_00]: that never grew even a vegetable before
they started growing cannabis and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they started venturing into the world of
other gardening and Applications of the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that they've gained from growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for you, what was what was your first
experience growing any type of plant my
[SPEAKER_01]: first experiencing growing was in Missouri
I had a buddy who was growing indoor and
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to move it somewhere Due to some
circumstances that were out favorable and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I took them in and started growing them
and then I realized I didn't let me raise
[SPEAKER_01]: this how we're gonna say it realized how
complicated It was but also how
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting it was at the same time and
that's really Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken what knowledge I have from
cannabis and moved it outwards because I
[SPEAKER_01]: really didn't wasn't into like very much
agriculture before that any houseplants or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Wow, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like I said, it's kind of a
split 50 50 of people that started,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Oh grandma had a vegetable garden
and I helped her out with it or I had no
[SPEAKER_00]: care for vegetables or other gardening and
then cannabis was my gateway drug into
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it has the power to do that,
you know, it it definitely does Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really cool to hear What do you
like to garden now other than cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else that you have in
your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you have a pretty big sort
of garden space I've had we have azaleas.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife has all the all the stuff around
the house I don't we have mints and
[SPEAKER_01]: rosemary and lemon balm and the thing that
I appreciate the most is she grows angel
[SPEAKER_01]: wing begonias And that is one of my
favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are those are so cool Rose and the
way it flowers is there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: special about that one But she does she
grows angel wing begonias and I I put in
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost tea and help keep them going
nice nice Well, let's let's go and touch
[SPEAKER_00]: back then on some of your first cannabis
growing adventures, I guess so it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like your first experience was almost put
Like in an emergency situation where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are helping a friend out by taking plants
From a non-ideal situation putting them in
[SPEAKER_00]: a situation where you could help them out
What did you learn from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you go about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Deciding how were you how you were going
to continue to grow these plants and did
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to a successful harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I took them when they were just in
flower and I brought them over and This
[SPEAKER_01]: probably wasn't a very good experience to
just to bring up but it really got my I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean as small as it was got my I think it
was about 12 plants, but I brought them
[SPEAKER_01]: from his house over to mine and we got
them to flower and we got them to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: and we got them frosts, you know got them
dried and that was kind of what sparked me
[SPEAKER_01]: into it and then as far as My first big
adventure was deciding to move out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Missouri and move to California and just
be like, you know, here we go cool So once
[SPEAKER_00]: you once you kind of took that step from
Missouri to California it it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: was like cannabis cultivation In your mind
was that something that you were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: driven by in any way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh 100% 100% because you know,
I don't know if you've ever lived in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Midwest, but I want to say before like
2012 I mean the amount of Decent weed you
[SPEAKER_01]: could get was okay, but it's kind of
perplexing when you know how things work
[SPEAKER_01]: on the you know on the west coast to see
like trash run like To see garbage come in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and you're like how does like how
does this product make it to the end mark?
[SPEAKER_01]: It like there's no, you know, we're no
reason and then I kind of got I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: move somewhere and I was picking Colorado
or California and I came out trim camp one
[SPEAKER_01]: year at a buddy's house and Then me and my
wife my girlfriend at the time my wife now
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like we're moving to California and
she was like, oh you're okay with it And I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like you let's do it and I kind of
moved out here Didn't really have anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: to live when I got out of here I got in
contact with my friend and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: started working for him when I got here
cool like at a At a cannabis farm or
[SPEAKER_00]: something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah at a farm cool How was your
experience with the the cannabis farms
[SPEAKER_00]: like in terms of a commercial cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Operation there's the good and there's the
really bad There's the well back then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the there was the good and there
was the atrocious and it depended on where
[SPEAKER_01]: you went you could see things that you
didn't want to see or You know as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: just some of growing like people spraying,
you know avid and fluoromide or doing
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they can To compensate for their
lack of skill to get a product to the end
[SPEAKER_01]: market, you know without far any
consequences or not thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: anything outside of you know out of profit
and then you see people who cared about it
[SPEAKER_01]: you really kind of see the difference of
growers when you travel around and see the
[SPEAKER_01]: different farms because it's there's a
stark difference or was a stark difference
[SPEAKER_00]: For the growers that are still around
Fisher did you only have that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial experience with your friend
that you worked with or did you it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like you were looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other farms at least by their practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have an opportunity to work with
any of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, so I came out and I worked with
my buddy of the first and the second year
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I got hired on to a big farm up
in Lake County, California and so it was
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 acres total 235 acre plots on the side
of a mountain so old school black market
[SPEAKER_01]: farm and There were tiered into the side
of this mountain or five by five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: poles And so all tiered down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll cut out of the mountain for these
holes and they were just I don't know like
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 gallons of dirt in each hole or more
And so I started doing that And that ended
[SPEAKER_01]: in a raid which wasn't very fun But after
that I worked greenhouses I worked for
[SPEAKER_01]: another farmer and then in between Getting
growing jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go around and do piecemeal work at
other farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I probably worked at you know,
15 16 different places Okay Are there are
[SPEAKER_00]: there any experiences that you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Had while working at those places that
stand out that you'd feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about just to kind of spread a
little bit of the experiential knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: well That's a vast question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what what kind of experiences good
experiences bad like IOP experiences or
[SPEAKER_01]: like inspirational or kind of like what
got me going Well, let's let's take it
[SPEAKER_00]: from the route of Through your experience
Working at all these different facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: at all these different facilities Farms,
what did you pick up that you carried with
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were things that you knew you
needed to can you needed to avoid when?
[SPEAKER_01]: Having your own grow Avoiding laziness
because what a lot of the farmers well
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was so much money into it
back in the day is that someone would own
[SPEAKER_01]: a property and they wouldn't necessarily
they would know how to grow but they would
[SPEAKER_01]: be as hands-off as they could with it and
The lack of a tenant of tenet is a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: thing like trying to automate your outdoor
grow is I don't want to say it's lazy I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, there's obviously perks to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not an attentive grower You
need to be in the if you're not in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden You don't know what's going on Like
I don't care how many people you hire like
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're the one in charge of it and
you're not there It's not going to go well
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent gonna fail You know if you
try to subcontract your job to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: else who has less experience than you it
always turns out bad and so that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of what you learn is like If you want
this to go from the start to the finish as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as it can like you're you can't go on
vacation You can maybe take two days three
[SPEAKER_01]: days off at the most like I mean You need
to be there and you need to be in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden every other day Hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the that's what they know
people who aren't into growing and start
[SPEAKER_01]: growing outdoor It's not a hands-off thing
by any means I mean, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: watching and sitting and watching but
there's also a purpose to that too And
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like you need to know When you
might have a bug infection start or an
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation starting or you need to know
Hey, these things look like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting underwatered because by the next
morning they look you know Like there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of what a lot of what you are going to
need to know about the plants is just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be staring at them If it's it sounds
stupid, but when you start doing it you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna realize that I mean like go sit out
there for an hour in the morning and at
[SPEAKER_01]: night and in the Mid afternoon and watch
the differences and you know start
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking how they're reacting Right
definitely like picking up on the trends
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can apply the proper approach
whether it be through like an IPM practice
[SPEAKER_00]: or nutrient application, especially if
you're growing in some sort of living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: situation or something where you're using
the biology to make the Nutrients readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really be almost ahead of the
curve on that where you can't be like
[SPEAKER_00]: reactory You have to be proactive about it
and that takes a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I mean 95% of what you're
gonna use organically is not water
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see a problem you Already late
you're late to the game by the time you
[SPEAKER_01]: you pick up on it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you kind of gotta work What
to do ahead of time because by the time
[SPEAKER_01]: you figure out you did something wrong now
You've spent a week trying to correct that
[SPEAKER_01]: but you were already a week behind Yeah,
absolutely couldn't agree more hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain that to people It's like by the
time you see the problem you you're
[SPEAKER_01]: already late to the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already late to the party for sure
As opposed to like hydroponics where you
[SPEAKER_00]: could just have like missed a couple of ph
things for a day or two and it's gonna Go
[SPEAKER_00]: catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see a lot of it issues pop up
from that and then both of them kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have their positives and Negatives and I
think that you know, that is definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation for another day, but it's so
fascinating to hear I I do love organics
[SPEAKER_00]: when you like use the analogy of a battery
where the bigger the battery the more like
[SPEAKER_00]: runtime you have without having to worry
too much about it so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to get back into How you're
growing now and how you developed your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing style And so you kind of told us
about your negative experience with this
[SPEAKER_00]: these different cultivation jobs that you
had what were some of the things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: Picked up from these different jobs that
you took with you and either tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to Subsequent cultivation
experiences or what you still keep in your
[SPEAKER_01]: tool belt that you're using today Well,
and that's yes I love that question
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of the negative experiences
are learning what not to do working in
[SPEAKER_01]: other peaceful places and a good thing
about that is you get to see a wide array
[SPEAKER_01]: of people trying different things and
seeing what works and what doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to experience them yourself
because without door growing you get one
[SPEAKER_01]: shot a year so The ability to rerun
something over and over and figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on what works and what
doesn't work could take a decade,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Like because you think you're not
doing five six runs a year and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay that works that doesn't work
that doesn't work but what I did pick up
[SPEAKER_01]: is as far as outdoor growing goes,
I really don't like synthetics or
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-organic food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel like they perform as well
just from what I've seen and I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've indoors completely different story
but outdoors you if you you a compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: any day 100% of the time my money's on it
so as far as what I've learned that works
[SPEAKER_01]: is compost teas figuring out your watering
and then as far as Food sources going just
[SPEAKER_01]: using a good Multipurpose food in the
beginning and then kind of playing it with
[SPEAKER_01]: some top dresses by year throughout the
year because your compost tea if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a good compost tea is going to provide a
lot of nutrition because you don't need a
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need a You're not pumping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of nutrition You just
need something consistent and you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: ability for the soil to unlock what food
is already in there And that's what a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea does Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's uh, what's your typical go-to
compost tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just applying something
throughout the year do about Four eight
[SPEAKER_01]: cups Four to eight cups of worm castings
four cups of compost and the worm Casting
[SPEAKER_01]: is that type of compost you get are gonna
make a night and day difference If you get
[SPEAKER_01]: some compost from the grow store and it
has sticks and twigs and it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's meant for you know mulch for someone
like flower bed It's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a high compost or a high High
quality compost and you mean there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple different You can use like there's
the sea compost from Oregon There's the
[SPEAKER_01]: Malibu blend which I really don't like
because it comes from its steer manure and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like there can be bugs and stuff
in it I've learned that over the years to
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid that but basically earthworm
castings compost Help meal alfalfa meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a little bit of humic acid Maybe a
little bit of azomite and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: blackstrap molasses or molasses you get a
grow store and you Do like aeration for it
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you do like just a quick mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: No do an aeration and you're gonna run it
about 24 hours and Doing outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you never want to start at the morning
You start in the morning and it sits in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun all day You can like try to cover
it with light, but the temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: really gonna play into it Do you want to
start it at night run it all night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it in the morning probably run it
the rest of the day and by the next
[SPEAKER_01]: morning that's gonna be it's it's gonna be
popping off and you'll see the foam and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see all the CO2 Coming out of it
and that's how you know, you're where you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool so as you've as you
were learning all these different sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and Finding that you know compost
teas and the applications of different
[SPEAKER_00]: composts and worm castings and stuff Are
extremely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what did you start to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop in terms of your other top
dressing practices or other growing
[SPEAKER_01]: practices that you're still using today
They need out the plants I don't you've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen outdoor plants a lot of people don't
know if you have a plant that's 10 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: tall I mean you're gonna say from the
stock out at least 40% of that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaned out because you're not gonna get
any light breaking through there And so
[SPEAKER_01]: what you learn is if you leave all that on
there, it's gonna lower Kill the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: your buds and also create a place for
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want to worry about airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another good one Keeping your
plants spread apart and not having them
[SPEAKER_01]: grow into each other This is gonna stop
bugs from spreading I've seen gardens get
[SPEAKER_01]: ravished by broad mites I mean,
but if you have everything right next to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other, you're never like You're not
gonna stand a chance because they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: spread too quick For sure, yeah We
typically will grow in rows But it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: a much larger production what what I'm
doing that like the commercial facility
[SPEAKER_00]: versus what you're doing it at your home
and I I love how you have your different
[SPEAKER_00]: beds sort of separated out and How you
have the ability to kind of address each
[SPEAKER_00]: plants needs in a very holistic approach
of applying a meal of this or you know
[SPEAKER_00]: This that or the other thing in an organic
form What what have been some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: recent like let Let's ask this in a
two-part question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of what has worked Really well
for you Recently in the garden What would
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those things be and what would
also be some things that haven't very
[SPEAKER_00]: worked very well for you in the garden
recently sort of the the pros and the Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Worked very well since I moved this spot
not worrying about the height or the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant I found that over the last
couple years that the amount of soil you
[SPEAKER_01]: have is gonna correlate with how much but
you're gonna get off the plant regardless
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to plant early to get larger
plants Generally isn't gonna yield
[SPEAKER_01]: anything more than you planning two weeks
later and having a smaller but a fatter
[SPEAKER_01]: plant Which is a good thing to know I
don't think a lot of people realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you see it, you know I had one
from seed last year that was 12 feet tall
[SPEAKER_01]: All it did was create a headache a lot of
plant to work on and got the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that a plant that was you know Six to
seven feet tall would have had on it Sure
[SPEAKER_01]: training and not trying to shoot for the
largest plant competition is a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know there's a really good one because
you look like when it comes to working on
[SPEAKER_01]: them and not having the limited amount of
time to do that is you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be trucking the ladder around or You
know, if you can't see the tops of the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds You don't know if a caterpillar got
in or you like you create this Scenario
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're not gaining anything But but
a lot more work to get the same end result
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't think a lot of people realize
that too with I mean you can get ooh nod
[SPEAKER_01]: by a big plant and they are very cool But
when you're the one taking care of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is it's not necessarily very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No and then also, it feels like a lot of
the especially in an organic scenario a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the productivity potential for each
plant is heavily dependent upon the root
[SPEAKER_00]: space of that plant and so if you're and
yeah, right and so if you're growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: in a limited root space say like a raised
a raised pot or a raised bed of some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're planting them in a row or
something else where they are then sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: butting up on each other so they only have
a specific Square footage per plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have like sole dominance over versus
the other plants then coming in and their
[SPEAKER_00]: roots interchanging So they only have a
certain amount that they can work with and
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah If you're gonna get a bigger plant
then sure you're gonna have a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass But all that bigger biomass is
taking energy away from what could be
[SPEAKER_00]: flower site production 100% I mean I even
see this in indoor too like smaller plants
[SPEAKER_00]: usually produce the danker buds They can
just put a lot more effort into it
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're talking about
similar pot sizes You know growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna have a three four footer next
to a two footer and the same amount of pot
[SPEAKER_01]: with the same amount of roots You're gonna
have haven't yes, it's gonna focus more
[SPEAKER_00]: energy into production for sure It might
not be this like comparable yields like
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get more yield out of the three
or four footer next to the two footer but
[SPEAKER_00]: the Each individual flower might have a
little bit more appeal to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it might have a better genetic
expression or morphology Sometimes those
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger plants when you grow too many bud
sites on them the flowers seem to lose a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of that Luster that would be on
something that is a more manicured plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that has fewer bud sites as As it relates
to the root size Yeah and I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: like with outdoor too and especially with
Organic because you're not able to like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not able to pump it like there's
only so much you can do to feed it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a compost tape Which is gonna
start pre you know creating a bioavailable
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient But not necessarily in a large
amount that you want to really keep an eye
[SPEAKER_01]: on your soil Size to your plant size
because as above so below like you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want your plant five times bigger than the
pot I mean you want to have it maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: know You're you're flowering plant two to
three times bigger than we're like the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil area width and height wise You're
gonna run into that we're gonna get string
[SPEAKER_01]: ear buds like you can have as many bud
sites on it as you want but if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have You know, you can have a Cadillac but
if you put a four-cylinder in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not gonna be like you got to keep You
got to keep everything balanced,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can't have a giant plant
with no soil and no food No ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed it Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to kind of keep that in mind It
almost seems like oversizing the pot to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant size tends to provide the
longest runway for what's available and so
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant can just it can do the the best
that it can do in the environment without
[SPEAKER_00]: being limited by something like a The root
size or something like that 100% and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think You know, I don't know that
a lot of people think this but like with
[SPEAKER_01]: your organic growing and I don't know the
analogy put this You're like the pit crew
[SPEAKER_01]: at NASCAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not the race car driver Like you're
there trying to make sure everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: ready when it wants to use it You're not
the one, you know putting the gas on
[SPEAKER_01]: steering the wheel You're just trying to
be there and you're trying to give the
[SPEAKER_01]: plan everything it needs so it can do what
it wants to do But like if you try to take
[SPEAKER_01]: the reins too much, that's when you're
gonna go off the rails Because it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna do what it wants to do You know and
like you need to be there and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that has what it needs But it's like
you're not really steering the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to making sure it's
it's fueled For sure and even even in that
[SPEAKER_00]: same analogy of like a race car,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to run the fuel to empty
You're gonna try and fill it up before it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets too low because you don't want to
throw that race car off balance by having
[SPEAKER_00]: a weight increase and decrease that's
gonna sort of like make that battery of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Root zone overcharged or undercharged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to kind of keep it at this
nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Level so that it it it has the buffet to
eat from without ever needing to feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to wait for that buffet to get
refilled Oh, yeah 100 roll that plays in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH 2 because if you if you don't keep
everything As far as being able to control
[SPEAKER_01]: pH in a pot outdoors You can't all you can
do is do everything right so that it has
[SPEAKER_01]: what it so it doesn't go out of balance
because I mean if you overfeed over
[SPEAKER_01]: compost He put too much you can go to
acidic or if you want to over amend with
[SPEAKER_01]: like azomite or you want to use like a A
silica per rock based product you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna keep you got a pick You got
to kind of keep giving it and then a
[SPEAKER_01]: middle ground So it has what it needs or
it will it will go out of pH, which is it
[SPEAKER_01]: happens rarely But when it does like
there, you know, you're kind of you shot
[SPEAKER_01]: your foot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're done Yeah, I agree it it is it is
one of those things where it is a boat so
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's hard to oversteer it but if You
do oversteer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to correct it So little
little tiny tweaks here and there always
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to work the best as opposed to these
giant fluctuations in Additions or
[SPEAKER_00]: subtractions to what's there and available
for the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to ask in your current setup
since you did just restart into larger did
[SPEAKER_01]: you say 200 gallon pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from 150 to 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, okay So did you restart that all from
scratch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do a fresh mix of new potting mix
and substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you use older substrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I went with new substrate Okay,
what's your ideal mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you know, how about you run us
through what you did to prepare those?
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 gallon beds so that anybody that's
thinking about growing some large outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants has an idea of what it takes to get
one of those started Well, so your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're gonna want to use is Really
gonna be kind of dependent on your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: style and the thing that I get carried
away with if you were starting from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch is you don't need a Heavily fed
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a hot soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need something with but you know
That's loaded up with every single
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment on the earth on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something very simple you want
perlite heat moth
[SPEAKER_01]: pH balance you want a buffer in there and
Maybe a very light food and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: that allows you to amend it yourself
because the first year I got soil I got
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it was basically like a Grow
shops version of like Fox farm or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, but they had loaded it I had
every amendment like you stick your hand
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bag It would burn your hand like it
was hot like there was a lot going on
[SPEAKER_01]: there And what that kind of kills your
ability to do is do anything else because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's already been done Like if you were
sure you make a change You already
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's under the Sun's already in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do anything with it,
which doesn't mean it's bad It means
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna want to run water if you're
gonna run a light tee That's about as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as you're gonna go with it What I like to
do now is get a more basic soil without a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of food I found that down-to-earth Bio
fish is a very very good amendment for the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning so I'll amend per bag with bio
fish and make sure it's really well mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and Then I will pre water all the
pots and try to keep them wet for a week
[SPEAKER_01]: or two before I'm gonna plant in there to
like start the biological process in there
[SPEAKER_01]: get everything alive get everything
working and then you want to check to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure your soil is not hot because your
soil is hot you're gonna burn your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's like One thing that no one ever
teaches you like hot soil is literally
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors It's going to be hot like you're
gonna put your hand in there and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be steam coming out of it You want
to kick off the biological process and let
[SPEAKER_01]: that work its way through a little bit
before you're gonna plant your plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there so it's it's like almost making a
Fresh super soil or a living soil of sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're taking your porosity Fraction
of the media like your perlite or your
[SPEAKER_00]: pumice or volcanic rock or anything like
that, then your substrate side peat moss
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco coir anything like that and then your
biological side, which is also kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate side where it's your compost
adding all those together then adding your
[SPEAKER_00]: sources of nitrogen potassium phosphorus
calcium magnesium all those different
[SPEAKER_00]: macros and micros mixing those all
together and all of a sudden you have all
[SPEAKER_00]: this biological activity and that
biological activity is pushing off a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of heat and you want to wait for that
biological activity to kind of slow down
[SPEAKER_00]: because You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just not only is it like hot in terms
of the chemical available or the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability is going to be so high that
the plants going to be burnt through the
[SPEAKER_00]: osmotic stress of the electrical
Conductivity of everything that falls into
[SPEAKER_00]: solution while the biology is that active
but also the actual thermophilic
[SPEAKER_00]: composting that's occurring that's going
to overheat the root zone and cause
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothermia to the roots and actually
cause Death and decay that way better than
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was saying, but yes 100% is like
that's when you hear hot soil Everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: thinks nutrients well like out hot soil is
literally temperature hot soil And yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will burn it will kill the plant just
base because I mean it could be like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking the summer here It's like 70,
but if you stick your hand in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's 95 degree you put a plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean a 95 degree root zone is not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're going from 60
degrees to 95 degrees That's like maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you could slowly get up to 95 degrees and
hold it for a few days if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: available water, but definitely not If
it's just from one to the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I mean it can handle higher
temperatures in the summer like this
[SPEAKER_01]: summer it was a hundred and twelve degrees
for a week straight and the plants were
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely they were not happening that
but they you know, they hope sure but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you did that to the other point It would
you know, it'd be game over it's also one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the reasons why you have to turn
thermophilic compost because It'll combust
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have it at the like perfect level
of dryness to wetness ratio and You have
[SPEAKER_00]: the just the you know, right amount of
enzymes in there the outside temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity aren't You know Disadvantages
for causing a fire to start it'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneously combust and I have never
said flame videos now I My dad had compost
[SPEAKER_00]: in our backyard and it caught on fire one
year and he had to spray it down with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hose It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I didn't know it could happen either
until I saw but now I'm always very
[SPEAKER_00]: cautious about making thermophilic Compost
the power of the microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like that fact that they can get
that hot all the way up to the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion and Still be active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it makes me think of those like
the Extremophiles that live near the
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal vents in the bottom of the ocean
that you know, it's like Where the water
[SPEAKER_01]: would boil if it could but it's under
literally Rick can be higher than boiling
[SPEAKER_01]: water temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah to 300 degree water and these crabs
and crustaceans and worms and stuff are
[SPEAKER_00]: living and they're fine with it that's
Nature is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's it it's really cool to
know that there are these extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between Something that does
use this biologically active Substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a non biologically active substrate
in like hydroponics and you can achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: really great results with both and the
interactions between the rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate and the nutrients that are
either being produced biologically or
[SPEAKER_00]: being introduced through the nutrient
water package the reaction with the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: is also super different to like The root
exudates that are produced in an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: media to help attract the specific biology
That's going to help chelate the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to make them available There's
something really cool About that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean how long did that process take to
develop the nature, you know, I mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah That's what kind of why I don't doubt
it either because I mean it for millions
[SPEAKER_01]: of years This has worked and you like it's
like the whole thing is already organized
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like the um soil food web that
dr. Lane Ingham will preach through her
[SPEAKER_00]: Different books and and classes and stuff
it it makes a lot of sense that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these different processes that have
developed over time to help cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: process phosphorus and nitrogen and
potassium and carbon and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that you can Like
actually now put through that scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: lens and explain Where it's but it's still
all those interactions together are almost
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to explain as a whole rather than
the each individual processes Because you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at one part of it and it's like okay,
so The plant is gonna you know put
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates into the soil To attract
something you're like, oh that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then it also does 20 other things
and their sugar their sugar it produces
[SPEAKER_01]: out through the Stomata to keep plant to
keep bugs away that'll kill but like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like you start looking at all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like this is Very well
orchestrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is it is So Back to you building your
your current setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were building these beds I
remember you said that you had a rock
[SPEAKER_00]: layer at the bottom Did you layer the pots
in any other ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you add anything else like either
on top of the substrate or within the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of help with a specific style that
you were going for Yes, so this year which
[SPEAKER_01]: I normally don't do and I had kind of goes
back here questions of things that have
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed results was doing a top a top dress
layer of You know here remember I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the grab a clover and some other
grasses and some legumes a type of peas To
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the Sun from beating down on the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the problem with outdoor
growing Is that you're gonna have a large
[SPEAKER_01]: pot and you're gonna have it dry from the
bottom up and the top down at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time and Leave a section in the center as
it's using the water and has the Sun's
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporating the water You're gonna end up
with you know a dry bottom of your pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: a dry top of your pot and a wet center of
your pot which is gonna mean you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: over water the center and to get the
bottom wet you're gonna have to really
[SPEAKER_01]: over water the center to get the water
down to the bottom of the pot from the top
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you're gonna have the top of the
pot drying out and Killing all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: your food web roots on the top of the soil
that run about I don't know maybe they run
[SPEAKER_01]: a foot deep from the top of the soil and
so I did a cover crop which worked
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely well, but Not thinking about it
or never done doing it before It attracts
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of bugs you get a lot of pest
product because there's a whole like five
[SPEAKER_01]: different food sources You just brought
onto the scene like right in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: vicinity of your plant, which I would do
it again if I use Something that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow as high that wouldn't grow up into
the bottom of the plant and like literally
[SPEAKER_01]: have a ladder into the end of the plant
Like a climbing up here something there
[SPEAKER_01]: You threw up a you threw up a ladder right
up into the right up in your bud So that
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that walks on the ground could
make it up in there that it couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: before but now you know You make it a lot
easier, but I don't really layer the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put the soil in I don't have I mean
a lot of people do super soils where we
[SPEAKER_01]: want the bottom of the soil to be one
thing in the middle to be another in the
[SPEAKER_01]: top to be another Really just do one soil
make sure it's a mess
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a mulch layer like a mulch layer or
just something you don't really want mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: you want something inert because you don't
want it to start you don't want any
[SPEAKER_01]: biological composting process to start on
top of your soil because it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be not be good But like a straw
and inert straw something that will get
[SPEAKER_01]: wet but won't like start to break down and
decompose to the top just To add a buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: for the light or a buffer for Sun heat
radiation Cool kind of kind of helps trap
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of the moisture too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not losing too much through
evaporation Evaporation and then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping your soil temps down which I mean
it's keeping your soil temp down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a lost battle There's only
you can get them don't get a black pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: don't let the Sun touch the top of the
soil That's about all you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean you can without or there's only
so much you can control You just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of figure out what you can it's like
Whether the a prayer control what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: control and don't worry about what you
can't but like figure out what you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to do that very well fair
enough Were there any other things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you implemented this year that you hadn't
in years prior that you felt was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement to your plants or did you add
anything that you kind of felt as though
[SPEAKER_00]: hindered your ability to Tune the plants
the way that you like to I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: that I really did anything to hinder
myself this year other than bad strength
[SPEAKER_01]: Choices if you saw my pictures,
I had one strain that did phenomenally
[SPEAKER_01]: well and then I had one strain that I was
very disappointed in and because It
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't handle heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was untrainable It just anything that I
was going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not it would not take it and that
you know You at that point, you just gotta
[SPEAKER_01]: let it run You know, if you try to I don't
like to top plants I like to just bend
[SPEAKER_01]: them over and get new shoots to come off I
feel like when you pop them it it kills
[SPEAKER_01]: your yield and it kind of it sets the
plant back about a week Or so if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna cut on it if you're gonna top it you
want to top it before you plant it in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but Strain choice outdoors is it's
massive like you can get one like I had
[SPEAKER_01]: one that Just you know, and then you have
half your garden set on that and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're okay with it But I mean it's
there but you can't do anything about it
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree it We've even just stopped
even doing any training on outdoor plants
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean especially because they're in rows
and you have you know 30 or 40 plants per
[SPEAKER_00]: row it doesn't really make Too much sense
to just to try and even the canopy it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of becomes a hedge either way We have more
surface area too if it's not even right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely Yeah, you have peak that peaks
and valleys versus a flat plane always has
[SPEAKER_00]: more surface area That's the same reason
why we tend to not top indoors either is
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you have a completely even
canopy in a four by four area then you
[SPEAKER_00]: only have 16 square feet of available
surface area directly down from the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you have peaks and valleys you can
sometimes One and a half X to double your
[SPEAKER_00]: total surface area, which just means more
photon absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah That's a it's a great point for
people to think about when you do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors though where the Sun as a single
point But spread across such a large
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area at a such high PPFD and the
fact that it moves across the sky you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this ability to really capture light On
almost all different sides of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you're down in like
California Not too high on the latitudes
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of that really nice light
And so it almost feels like you could top
[SPEAKER_00]: it you could spread it out You could do
whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not growing directly next to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna capture You know a ton of a
ton of energy from the Sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh 100% like that's I've noticed I have a
tree that overhangs one part of my garden
[SPEAKER_01]: and around high noon, so whatever the
brightest of the day between about 12 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 32 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blocks a couple of plants off and You
notice the quality of the bud on those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants will be a little bit higher and the
yield is going to be lower But like right
[SPEAKER_01]: when when the PPFD is gonna be too hot is
I want to say too high but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Extremely high if you can block that off
and that's like a lot of the advantage of
[SPEAKER_01]: a greenhouse is that you're you're taking
that and lowering it down a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: your quality is going up sure you're
making like a more even spread of the
[SPEAKER_00]: light at a lower intensity rather than
that sort of high peak intensity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: midday and low intensity of the morning
and afternoon Yeah, so um out of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of your gardening nowadays What do
you think is one of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you do in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you might not have touched on so far
if or if you've already touched on it
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe dive a little bit deeper into its
importance to your gardening Say watering
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably going to be your biggest
factor in anything if you're not watering
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly that anything else you do Is
gonna be it starts with watering
[SPEAKER_01]: everything has to be null and void.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really keeping an eye on how much water
your plants are using and how much is
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporating is gonna be a huge factor
because that's especially I must say
[SPEAKER_01]: organic because You're gonna your microbes
are gonna be die if you get it too dry and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna die if it's too wet and
you're gonna get Mold if it's too wet
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna get fungus and root rot if
it's too wet so that is like if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good soil and you can keep the Water in
the pot at the exact level you want the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have the best results back
more For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what are some of your watering
practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are some of the tells that you
look for and what are some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: insights?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to to share with other
outdoor growers that might be looking into
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something in these larger raised
pots where you have a because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Like matrix potential would be
something where you're actually using soil
[SPEAKER_00]: sand silt and clay where the water
availability is dependent upon that matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: potential whereas within substrate you
have osmotic potential and you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have water available within the pore space
of these substrates that are made out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a soil list media where you
don't have sand silt or clay Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so what are some of these practices that
you do with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your your substrate and if you could also
just really quick touch on what what
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate Did you use for these 200 gallon
pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I used vital earths blend soil which is
It's pretty good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used it before it was a little
bit pricey because they are They're proud
[SPEAKER_01]: of themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a negative way, but you know vital
earth is you know, it's kind of a puff
[SPEAKER_01]: brand Sure soil is the only soil you can
find that doesn't have any Dairy manure
[SPEAKER_01]: any dairy anything related to dairy
farming in it, which is a one of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: things because dairy farming And the
byproducts of it are not nice at all when
[SPEAKER_01]: you start looking into that But I did that
and as far as watering goes is that You
[SPEAKER_01]: want to water you want to water every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to not water every day if
you're if you're If you're not watering
[SPEAKER_01]: for four days at a time, there's a problem
and if you're watering Every day and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dry every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also a problem You want to get to
the fine medium where you're watering
[SPEAKER_01]: every day to keep it so I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use a moisture meter so I have no
way to tell you how to like verify this
[SPEAKER_01]: but wherever your water level wherever
your moisture level you want to be you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to drop down a little bit every day
and bring it back up a little bit past
[SPEAKER_01]: that every day and you want to keep it in
this range because if you let your soil go
[SPEAKER_01]: dry if you let your soil dry out it's
gonna become hydrophobic and that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: make it really hard to water it and get it
wet in the next day or two without having
[SPEAKER_01]: to like Literally run water through the
pot notes coming out the bottom and even
[SPEAKER_01]: then you might have dry pockets within
there I'm gonna get like channeling and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff as well You get channeling or you
can like you can think that the pot is
[SPEAKER_01]: full water and you stick your you can like
Stick your hand down in there and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: find just dry There'll just be dry areas
in there where it doesn't get wet Don't
[SPEAKER_01]: let it get past the point of being too dry
It's gonna be hard to get it as a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: back to where you want it to go For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of makes me think of a circadian
rhythm where you really want like because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants kind of have this 24-hour cycle
just like humans do Where you have the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up and going down and it's
something that has just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically been embedded in our code
Following that with plants does help it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems with their overall health rather
than having these extremely long points of
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and then High irrigation,
you know, you can run into like hypoxia
[SPEAKER_00]: events or stuff at that point as well too
where you have too much water in the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate But yeah finding that Perfect
sort of balance within the substrate very
[SPEAKER_01]: layman on here But it's hard to explain if
you're not using a moisture meter because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't say like it needs to be here and
needs to go there needs to go there it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of all played by here and like you I
explaining it would be easier in person to
[SPEAKER_01]: show you what I mean, but another thing
too about that is If you go out at night
[SPEAKER_01]: and your soil feels dry and you go out in
the morning and your soil looks wet the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of water at that the plant is
dumping back into the soil at night and
[SPEAKER_01]: also trick you to Because if the soil is
dry at night and it's wet in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not wet all the way through the pot
You still need to water it But the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of water that is up in the plant that
comes down when it goes to I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: say goes to sleep But when it goes to
sleep is a it's gonna be a lot of volume,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with a large plant So you got
to be careful not get tricked by that
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you go out, you know It you
know in the evening before the Sun goes
[SPEAKER_01]: down and you're like, oh these need water
You got in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like they don't need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still need water for sure Yeah,
you get a lot of condensation to on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of soil just from the the temperature
change from night to day And yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely seen that where it looks
like it's fine And then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: it's starting to look drought stressed
with some wilting leaves or perhaps some
[SPEAKER_00]: you know red petioles or You know
yellowing around the fringes or some other
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of high EC osmotic stress that you
might see like the bottom start to yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: on yellow from the you know, you'll start
yeah hundred percent right and I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: another another really good point to bring
up especially when you are running a
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavily amended substrate that you're
using that biological activity that by
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining a certain moisture content
You're also maintaining the health of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology within the pot for those nutrient
cycling processes to continue to occur at
[SPEAKER_00]: a you know, a healthy rate rather than
booms and busts what because that can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause some some burning or Nutrient
imbalances I've seen as well or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: kill off
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really great point Yeah,
but if you can have fruiting mushrooms in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pots and you can keep them alive and
they keep fruiting over and over again You
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're like right where you need
to be because you can use that as a gauge
[SPEAKER_01]: to the whole the whole soil health as a
whole You know, that's a that's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good way to sort of explain it for anybody
that's grown say mushrooms because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you make your grains for the different
mushrooms like oyster mushrooms or
[SPEAKER_00]: shiitake mushrooms or any edible
mushrooms, let's say and You you take
[SPEAKER_00]: those grains and you either steam them or
you cook them You don't cook them until
[SPEAKER_00]: they're mush and and and wet and sopping
and soaking where you can take a handful
[SPEAKER_00]: of them squeeze them and water comes out
you cook them until they're just Cooked
[SPEAKER_00]: enough where there's enough water content
within them so that the mycelial colonies
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of take hold colonize those
different grains and then you can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: those fruiting bodies from because the
fruiting bodies Yes, they do contain a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of moisture, but they pull a lot of that
moisture from this the substrate block and
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the whole block kind of shrivel
up after the mycelium sort of consumes it
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fruiting bodies sprout So that's a
really good point because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want it to be mush where it's
really wet It can't be dry because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have the ability for the
mycelial colony to take hold of it It has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a kind of like a Goldilocks zone
Some people call it it is kind of like and
[SPEAKER_01]: then like for I don't know how you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that It's the canary in the coal
coal Might instead of speak in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: way, but if you have fruiting bodies You
know like you hit where you need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: because if they can live and the mycelium
come expand and they can fruit and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not Getting overwatered to where they turn
brown and die and you see new fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies coming up, you know Constantly
every couple days now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like your whole your soil food web is
you've hit where you is the best you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like some people will call like the
mycelial structure the roots of mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: where like using it as an analogy for
plants and their roots and in using that
[SPEAKER_00]: analogy, they're not wrong in some aspects
where the moisture content for Healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelial production is the roughly the
same moisture content required for healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: root production and root health so that's
it that's a really good analogy to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: up to people who have either one
experience or the other that they can then
[SPEAKER_01]: apply that to Yeah, and it's like and
yeah, and then it's easy to like for an
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious approach Too because if you can
see that like that's you don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know anything like if you don't know
anything That is like that's your sign
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know that you're golden there
once you've hit that For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you get into like what kind of
like I think I have shaggy parasols that
[SPEAKER_01]: come into the pots and I don't know if
they're necessarily from Spores that are
[SPEAKER_01]: on the property or from the soil I put in
but I have or something some amendment I
[SPEAKER_01]: use I don't know like exactly where they
came from but I have the same fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies every year Even when they soil same
fruiting bodies and you've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify Them as to what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I'm no I'm no micro expert But I
have got on some reddits and that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told multiple times They kind of
fit I haven't took a spore print or gone
[SPEAKER_01]: into all that but I kind of assumed that's
what they are That's kind of what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been led to believe for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should you should see if there's like
I know some Like mushroom production
[SPEAKER_00]: companies like if they make a bunch of
shiitake mushrooms or other things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll sell their fruiting blocks
afterwards as mushroom compost and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen people take those and put Them into
highly active substrates and then get more
[SPEAKER_00]: fruiting cycles out of it Listen where you
can then, you know go through and harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of shiitakes and stuff or oyster
mushrooms or whatever it is that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: growing on them Well, then to another
thing to think about are they endo or
[SPEAKER_01]: ectomycorrhizal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how are they gonna interact with your
plant too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we I you'd have to look into the the
specific type of Of mushroom that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that's going to interact with the
plant I You know some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are some mushrooms that
are I Forget the the exact term but
[SPEAKER_00]: they're basically some of them really like
dung or manure and some of them like
[SPEAKER_00]: rotted wood like It's like lignophile
Sephora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Yep, so there's like ones for rotting
wood ones for digested organic matter and
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would you'd have to wonder is it
going to be beneficial in a root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: where like if it recognizes the roots as
If it is Sephora Yeah, forgive us if we
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't using the correct terms But if it
likes if it likes wood or lignin and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going after the roots Is it gonna go after
roots that are dead?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to cause a disease to the
roots that are going to cause them to die
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: To leave the live roots alone and remove
the dead root tissue and potentially even
[SPEAKER_01]: provide some sort of Beneficial and yeah,
whatever whatever is in the compost or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever is already in the soil and
turning into something that it can use
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know so many of these different
interactions I feel like there's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: studies out there that have some of this
information in there So whoever finds that
[SPEAKER_00]: out, please let us know But this is it's a
fascinating conversation to think about if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to get into compost teas a lot
more Which is a step I haven't gone is
[SPEAKER_01]: like you need a microscope and looking at
what you have and every tea you have Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a step further than you know,
most most home growers or most anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's like I mean if that's your
profession I could see why you have you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: have the time and the ability to do these
things and it's kind of nice to know not
[SPEAKER_01]: really need to know but I mean taking your
tea and testing every tea you have and
[SPEAKER_01]: being like, okay Well, you know when I
this is my ingredients I use in the times
[SPEAKER_01]: I use in the temperatures It was I'm
getting a higher result out of that than I
[SPEAKER_01]: am if I do it, you know You know,
you can play it by year at home But like
[SPEAKER_01]: when you really get it down and start
doing the science on it like you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably fine-tune a team to be pretty
pretty good probably and a lot of it would
[SPEAKER_00]: then have to do with where you're sourcing
your microbial and biological consortiums
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you're feeding it and if those
Different constituents change throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the seasons as well like if you're using
like let's say you you make your own
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and You're using compost that you
make all year and it's from Your kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: scrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is your kitchen scrap based on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seasonally available produce and if so,
does that produce have a higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because it's going to be cores
of apple peels of banana shoots of
[SPEAKER_00]: broccoli kale, whatever these things are
egg shells coffee grounds, whatever is
[SPEAKER_00]: there that you're having right and You
know based on those Like I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium is gonna be high in banana
peels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavier in potassium or are you heavier in
something?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like oh, I had a bunch of dead and
dying Blackberries on my bush and I threw
[SPEAKER_00]: those in there And so you're gonna have a
bunch of phosphorus from the seeds of the
[SPEAKER_00]: of the blackberries and stuff Like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the makeup of the compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this biology going to affect it and
the source of the biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh 100% another thing I think about too,
which is I don't really know what so you
[SPEAKER_01]: have all your different Microrisals like
that you can use like obviously you can
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a million off the store like whatever
off the shelf Okay, when you colonize your
[SPEAKER_01]: pot with one and then you want to use
another later in the year Can it out
[SPEAKER_01]: compete the one you've already colonized
your pot with because you have all I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of I don't want to say think
of it but it's like Remember the name they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a product make up Boston has a
special type of bacillus in there or but
[SPEAKER_01]: do you know that that's Gonna out compete
what you already have in your pot or are
[SPEAKER_01]: you just growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like do you already have the
whole colony in 200 gallons and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to recolonize it Happy New Year
isn't even doing anything because I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: if you lab test and it does process
phosphorus That doesn't mean you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: get it to colonize and already colonized
pot and that's like a lot of like What I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen a research being done is
like, you know If you're gonna colonize
[SPEAKER_01]: your pot one in the beginning Are you ever
gonna be able to change the composition of
[SPEAKER_01]: what's living in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and try to recolonize it with
something else for sure the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes to mind about like that out
competent out competing of one Either
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say it's a mycelial colony You know,
you may have like an endo mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi within your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helping provide some benefit
between the roots and the the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil But then if you introduce
trichoderma, you're going to decimate that
[SPEAKER_00]: population of mycorrhizal fungi and it's
going to way out compete it and But it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also then going to provide its own
benefits to the plant not necessarily in
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient exchange but in protection from
like fusarium pythium other negative
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogens and root-borne diseases,
so What's the approach that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: take I think is really truly Subjective in
a lot of these different cases based on
[SPEAKER_00]: what you have available and what your the
pressure Are on your your system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh 100% yeah, that's this that's this kind
of thing that I think about going forward
[SPEAKER_01]: is like Trying to get to the point where I
know these or you can know these
[SPEAKER_01]: differences But it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not easy to do No, and like you
even said, you know, you're especially as
[SPEAKER_00]: an outdoor grower Your knowledge is built
up season to season rather than grow to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow where I mean it is grow to grow But
you have to look at it as this season to
[SPEAKER_00]: season thing because you have one
opportunity one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's one opportunity per year unless
you're doing some sort of light depth
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, but then you have a a greenhouse
basically and you need to Manage that
[SPEAKER_00]: completely differently than in your
outdoor setup What for your outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one of the things that you
touched on briefly earlier is that
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated pest management is very
important because You only have one crop
[SPEAKER_00]: per year that you get to work with and if
you're using this as medicine or even as a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational thing it the importance of
making sure that you make it through to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest with a limited crop per year is
Dire so it's dire and it you know enough
[SPEAKER_01]: suck to negatively touch on it is like and
that's what That's why I think outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: gets a bad rap is because some people will
do whatever they have to do to make it get
[SPEAKER_01]: to the end instead of doing what's right
and the hard way to get it to the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yes, the IPM is Figuring out your IPM
is gonna be something you need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: within the First year or two because if
you don't figure it out by then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: never gonna have subs, you know good years
after that like that's like a You got to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure that out and you got to probably
talk if you don't know someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: watching that doesn't know Talk to
somebody who does know and at least start
[SPEAKER_01]: with somebody Somebody the IPM that
they've kind of created because if you go
[SPEAKER_01]: out without knowing what you're doing
You're gonna have it's gonna be gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: bad time for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what are some experiences that you've
had with IPM applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that we can't necessarily tell
other people how to apply their own IPMs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in terms of where you found success
with a Let's say an early detection that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were able to eradicate and then
Perhaps something that maybe got out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control that you weren't necessarily able
to Fight back within that specific season
[SPEAKER_00]: where it did then negatively affect your
yields So when I look at the IPM and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and not using any Non approved
sprays like so even spinosad is not
[SPEAKER_01]: approved in California anymore,
even though it is organic So you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at like I'm very very religious I'm
not using anything that has any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: negative effect on human health that has
been proven so and When you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: an outdoor sense, it's not I'm never going
to get bugs It's like you are going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: something and you need to know that it is
going to happen and what you want to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: get in place an IPM that is going to slow
it's gonna reduce the chance of It
[SPEAKER_01]: happening and if it does happen slow it
down so you have time to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it referred to as achieving an
economic threshold Yes, there's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure and there's gonna be pest
pressure but you need to keep it very very
[SPEAKER_01]: low and Keep control of it because you're
never gonna have it's out the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never gonna not have bugs So ready
to say that I never had bugs this year is
[SPEAKER_01]: that's untruth Like did you did you
control it and did you do a good job and
[SPEAKER_01]: not have any negative effects from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, did you not have any bugs in your
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because I even use beneficial insects
Like we have green lacewing here that come
[SPEAKER_01]: around naturally on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ladybug larva There's assassin
bugs there's stuff that like so you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have bugs on your plants that aren't
bad that you're gonna want there so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of managing that and trying to
fix pick something that is Going to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the pressure at bay and allow you to make
a choice and that's why I saying earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to use your own bio innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have you know, Grand Evo and venerate
which are two Really good sprays that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna be consistent and use them
work very well But they are not gonna save
[SPEAKER_01]: you by any means Like if you could if you
go out and you weren't doing anything and
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that problem Like there's only a
few products that you can use that are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be organic the safe that are
actually gonna help you and they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be Contact sprays at best like you're
gonna have to go out and do it religiously
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring the pressure back down to where
you want it to be So I'd say being on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of that and figuring out a cycle of three
products you want to use so when I'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg I use a mixture of Mineral oil I'll
use Grand Evo and venerate and then when I
[SPEAKER_01]: get into start going in the flower pull
the oils out So I won't use any mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: oil style it oil if I was gonna use neem
oil I won't use that anymore or if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna use neem oil You're gonna back that
out and then I found another product I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't remember the name of it,
but it's basically sugars that they found
[SPEAKER_01]: that Plants produce on their own and they
synthesize them and they're so like a
[SPEAKER_01]: different type of sucralose On guard is it
on guard On guard or it's called regalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you said regalia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't really use regalia Okay,
I was thinking about using it but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a that's more to trigger a plant
immune response to like funguses and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll think of the name or I'll grab it
in a minute But anyway, you're gonna move
[SPEAKER_01]: in to keep using your venerate your Grand
Evo and then move into a Contact spray
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're gonna want to spray every
three or four days because you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna at a certain point you're just gonna
say I assume that I have pests and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna spray for them and you have to be
religious about it Right and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: follow that through and then write about
flower like right when you get into like
[SPEAKER_01]: the last two weeks You need to as hard as
it is to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna need to spray for Caterpillar
still Which is gonna be BT As much as I as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as nobody outdoor wants it as much as
nobody wants to spray their butt with
[SPEAKER_01]: anything However safe it is if you don't I
feel like the Consequences of having
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars and having caterpillar
excrement and having mold and all that is
[SPEAKER_01]: way out Way more harmful than having
sprayed with BT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean bacillus thuringiensis is not a
harsh Biology that would then negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the end-user.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it doesn't produce mycotoxins or
anything like that that would affect
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone whether it be through consumption
through combustion vaporization or Turning
[SPEAKER_00]: it into it like a tincture edible or
otherwise And that's that's been proven
[SPEAKER_00]: through its application on You know
numerous crops that have the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillars You know, it makes me think
of a lot of like different brassicas such
[SPEAKER_00]: as cauliflower cabbage Brussels sprouts
all those different things that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have something like that Sprayed into
them or else you are going to lose 50% of
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh you are and then the The negative for
ramifications of having mold in there like
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't know about cauliflower but
cannabis You don't want to take anything
[SPEAKER_01]: into the drying room that has mold in it
because now you have a sealed environment
[SPEAKER_01]: where you just have where if you don't
have control over your if you get any
[SPEAKER_01]: spikes and humidity you're just you
literally creating a culture like a pastry
[SPEAKER_01]: dish in there to spread mold to everything
and so Like caterpillars is like I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate caterpillars and I'm sure every
outdoor grower can say the exact same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing but like if you think you're
spraying Too early for caterpillars when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to flour, you're not just just go
ahead and do it for sure What since you do
[SPEAKER_00]: hang a lot of your end product outdoor
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokable flour as well as for concentrates
Do you end up doing any sort of washes on
[SPEAKER_00]: your flower to move remove?
[SPEAKER_00]: dust debris Insect droppings carcasses or
otherwise I do not and I thought about
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tested it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard mixed Results, I just don't
know it it would probably depend on how
[SPEAKER_01]: dry this when you're harvesting because if
you've already had your plants outside and
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% humidity every morning for two weeks
and then you duck them in a bucket of
[SPEAKER_01]: water and then put them in the drying room
I I haven't tried this but I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling from past experience that you're
gonna have a bad time Yeah, I don't I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see that turning out too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm not against washing it I
don't think it's a bad idea by any means
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're if you're gonna destroy
everything and not have anything at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end then you know People who smoke out or
you know what comes with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's a You know,
there's a little bit of a charm to outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: bud that you know, it has so much more
characteristic to it let's say and
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless if that's due to the extra
stuff that comes along with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's been something that people
have used for centuries thousands of years
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fact that we now have these
Pampered pallets of indoor cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: climate environmentally controlled Sort of
clean rooms in some cases filter water
[SPEAKER_01]: never sees anything other than Yeah,
I mean, I'm not and I love that and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome that we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also you can't throw Everything that
got to that point out when they say like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know outdoors in the past,
you know I think a lot of people do that
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of people newer generations
Especially that haven't been around a
[SPEAKER_01]: while Like I know people that I've like
talked to that don't know what brick weed
[SPEAKER_01]: is for sure They don't know like don't
like they you've lost this idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: weed has came and like now it's just all
indoor and there's nothing that everything
[SPEAKER_01]: before it doesn't exist Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean in some senses it it'll never go
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Well Maybe I shouldn't speak so soon on
that who knows maybe it'll go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's less than quality
Depending on how things change if federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization ever goes through but I don't
want to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah No, we don't want to talk about
Philip Reynolds right now so with With the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that you do, you know save a lot of
your flower for both Dried flower as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you do a lot of it seems like you
do a lot of concentrates as well What have
[SPEAKER_00]: been some of your your most memorable
harvests as both flower and concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: Most memorable harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this property, I'd say this year as
far as flower and concentrates go the
[SPEAKER_01]: Governmental wastes I grew did phenomenal
for both 100% Nice And as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: doing concentrates go I like doing
concentrates but another aspect that a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people need to think about too is that
You cut your your labor down to nothing by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing concentrates like doing fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cutting out Harvest you're
harvesting and it takes a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cutting out drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cutting out curing You're cutting
out bucking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cutting out big leafing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cutting out trimming You're cutting
out you're cutting off, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like three four months worth of work by
doing that Well, I do get a very excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: product depending on who you find to work
with and if someone's willing to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: you Which I've been lucky enough to find
somebody that's you know, pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: proficient at what they do and very
regarded but Yeah That's another aspect to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about is doing fresh frozen cuts
your labor down because growing outdoors a
[SPEAKER_01]: very labor-intensive job every step of it
every step of the way Yep and another cool
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about fresh frozen is like even we
touched on before about but the somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: how some people will wash their buds from
outdoor or even indoor if they so feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like It but you know, I've heard a
majority of people will do it for health
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons because they just can't have those
Extra things that come and take a ride in
[SPEAKER_00]: on that outdoor bud But if you're doing
fresh frozen and you're washing it For the
[SPEAKER_00]: for the trichome heads you do remove a lot
of those other potential Dusts and bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: and other things when you do outdoor fresh
frozen you're doing rosin the first wash
[SPEAKER_01]: you're never gonna have so any reputable
rosin Producer is never gonna have a first
[SPEAKER_01]: wash because the first wash is considered
contaminated So the first wash is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: taken set aside for edibles and that's
like so you're going once if you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: do a wash and you're gonna do You know the
guy that taught me does five washes So the
[SPEAKER_01]: first wash is gonna be a very quick wash
It's gonna be your best trichome heads and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's also gonna be all your contaminants
So I have a double-edged sword because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're washing off all the brightest,
you know easiest to break off strikes
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking all your contamination and
you're setting it to the side for edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they are they not rinsing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they do rent they do their first
wash and you rinse it and you collect all
[SPEAKER_01]: that and you set it aside It's considered
contaminated now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they've studied this or
whatever I don't know how deep the
[SPEAKER_01]: research into this goes I'm sure it's
there but that you're doing your washing
[SPEAKER_01]: your first wash of the first harvest you
get out of whatever your material washing
[SPEAKER_01]: is set to the side for edibles because
your then you're taking all your
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants or anything that could be in
there and Pushing it out and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not blessing that or freeze-drying
or turned into a smoke hole product So you
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting a cleaner product from that
Interesting you are taking the best of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best trichome heads and setting them to
the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure That's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard that before but I could
see how Depending on the washing practices
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be necessary to really make
sort of You know, maybe this is like one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those tricks that people use to get
that that what five star hash six star
[SPEAKER_00]: hash or whatever the stuff that you can
just straight Take the the you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nice no contaminants when it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just yep, and then you can yeah,
it's dabble basically at that point That's
[SPEAKER_00]: really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't I hadn't really thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a way that so like when
you're Yeah, it cleans it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the also the benefits the
benefit from doing, you know If you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna fresh frozen not for a resin But for
rosin you're are gonna get a cleaner end
[SPEAKER_01]: product that you can have too so if you
are concerned about contaminants or
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor health issues or your Sensitive or
whatever going on with that and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a better product choice for sure
But the older I get I realize why people
[SPEAKER_01]: stop smoking but it's not you know It is a
you're still smoking and combusting
[SPEAKER_00]: something for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I had to like just completely stop
actually smoking smoking I like combusting
[SPEAKER_00]: and I only do like a volcano vaporizer now
or one of their like handheld units
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just There's no way to kind of
avoid what comes with combustion It's
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you know, you're not smoking
cigarettes, but that you know over however
[SPEAKER_01]: long you've been smoking does Factor into
that at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I spent a decade smoking cigarettes
too and that didn't help me So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know now I get to face those
consequences Yeah, I mean that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also growing up in the Bay Area I think
blunts were life at one point and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I faced those consequences now with a
little bit of a cough every once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while hundred hundred percent,
you know, you knew when you're younger
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're get older and you're like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I need to rethink this a little bit
Absolutely All right, so You know since
[SPEAKER_00]: you spent some time doing the cultivation
thing at a professional level where you
[SPEAKER_00]: were helping out at these different farms
where you were learning these different
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and ins and out and and got a
paycheck basically from it without having
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the the entire business owner
yourself and then Moving into having your
[SPEAKER_00]: own home grow where you were making it for
your own medicine and for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption and For sharing that flower
with other people Where would you like to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the cultivation space sort of go over
the next five to ten?
[SPEAKER_00]: Years and and where do you think is though
it could improve?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does it need to it needs to be more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Less consuming energy and I know saying
that to an indoor growers a bad thing But
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a mass amount of energy consumed
to grow but for people to smoke it is when
[SPEAKER_01]: there's ways that can be done without that
and I think How the market has been
[SPEAKER_01]: trained as far as since legalization came
about and people that we know would never
[SPEAKER_01]: think about smoking weed or Putting a
thought in there now smoking and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: the only thing they learned of what
they've been taught at the dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: which is yeah, you know indoor weed is
good outdoor weed is shitty and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as far as the extent goes and I'm
not saying now indoor weed Almost stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, there are Good there is a
way to grow weed without being so You know
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon heavy using it carbon having
growing it I think there needs to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: shift to that because if you Look at how
many warehouses have been built to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: weed or how many warehouses have been
repurposed and there's the thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: lights in there just you know run the
meter is kind of like working away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that and the thing about Outdoor that gets
a bad rap is if you're gonna try to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 plants with five people You're not
gonna grow good wheat like it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: brought down to a smaller scale,
which I don't ever see happening I would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to see that but I don't think that
it's gonna be there But if you can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor and as and you can figure out how
much You can do to grow like that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 15 plants Probably can't grow more
than 15 plants and still do what I do
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm gonna overburden myself with
labor Yeah, you know and that's his
[SPEAKER_01]: personal perspective but to see the market
go to more of a niche smaller farmer kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing and making it more Accessible to
smaller growers to get in the market
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than just saying, you know If you
don't have two million dollars in backing
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're never gonna be a business It's
kind of where it's at now I feel maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: so much an organ but as far as Colorado
and California goes Like you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the market it's kind of the
same in Oregon right now and with the the
[SPEAKER_00]: price per pound Going down significantly
over the past three years and continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: to go down While the cost of production
continues to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seem as though any point that you
can reduce your costs or increase the not
[SPEAKER_00]: only the quality but the quantity of
production unfortunately is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important To make sure that small
businesses continue to remain viable a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these larger businesses because
overhead costs go down as you scale up
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to Like how much it costs to
run a business versus how much income that
[SPEAKER_01]: business makes Your net your your cost to
grow a pound goes down when you grow more
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously But what yeah what goes in what
entails that does the quality go down
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing that no other factors measured
Other than what can I produce for it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and that that is unfortunate and You
know, I mentioned RJ Reynolds earlier and
[SPEAKER_00]: and other large either tobacco companies
or other multi conglomerate companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: may pivot into the cannabis state space if
it were to become federally legal are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to produce cannabis I you
know, fortunately and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been able to increase how well
cannabis can be grown with less of a Like
[SPEAKER_00]: secretive nature to the processes behind
it a lot of this information is now more
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available and companies with lots
of Expendable revenue that they can put
[SPEAKER_00]: into research research and development and
creating Methodologies that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at a specific level especially if
they're homogenizing an end product like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll or something like that or a
concentrate Companies that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to produce vast amounts of
cannabis and get it to the market for a
[SPEAKER_00]: very low price but maintain consistency
and a Certain level of quality not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily, you know top-shelf highest
quality, you know that guy with four
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in his garage That's growing
everything in a living soil bed and just
[SPEAKER_00]: crushing it You know, like not that level
of quality but something where it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: smokable it's not gonna get you sick
because it has a specific level of
[SPEAKER_00]: standard that it has to be held to because
You have all these different regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have something that's going
to be usable But it's going to be porous
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a you're talking you're
talking Miller light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna be something that is a
lower quality product, but it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent and it's going to garner the
most use out of your average consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: because For me like I used to be a chef
But I still love getting a burger from
[SPEAKER_00]: like in and out or McDonald's or something
where it's consistent You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what it's gonna be You know
going to a burger house or something where
[SPEAKER_00]: there it's a fancy restaurant that has a
really nice burger Sometimes I'm like did
[SPEAKER_00]: they did they do too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they not do enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I gonna be overpaying and way under?
[SPEAKER_00]: Under liking what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh 100% um Yeah, that's like that's when
it when it when the top comes off and it
[SPEAKER_01]: fully goes legal There's going to be it's
gonna be a race to mediocrity to say not
[SPEAKER_01]: to be negative about it But it's gonna be
a race to the middle not to the bottom or
[SPEAKER_00]: the top Because it has to like meet some
standards for enough people to be repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: customers because that's the only way that
they're gonna be able to Maintain any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of business model like that, but it can't
be the best because that's gonna cost too
[SPEAKER_00]: much to produce and it can't be the worst
because Well, no one's gonna want to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to it So it has to be somewhere in
the middle and you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements advancements in technology
within the cannabis space like the
[SPEAKER_00]: deflation of different terpenes and the
mixing of different terpene profiles to
[SPEAKER_00]: match specific cannabis cultivars and
doing that through either gathered
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes from cannabis production or
synthetically produced terpenes or You
[SPEAKER_00]: know exogenously source terpenes from non
cannabis related still like natural
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, but then the mixing of though
then the application of that to You know
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll flour or even whole pounds of
What looks like nice cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but may be completely turpless when it's
done drying and curing because they Dried
[SPEAKER_01]: and cured it in five days, you know,
yeah or whatever race to the end goal was
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that do that Yeah, well like what
I've noticed here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure It's the same everywhere is so
when I came out here It was full boom like
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers everywhere like nobody like I
don't say nobody like farmers There were
[SPEAKER_01]: so there were farmers everywhere and they
got a bad rap from coming in from out of
[SPEAKER_01]: you know different states coming in
setting up shop trashing everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving and Being able to survive as a
business while creating a product that was
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible just because of the lack of
demand and The kind of approach I took as
[SPEAKER_01]: like leaving leaving the industry so to
say and finding the different career and
[SPEAKER_01]: then still doing what I'm doing is like
you're watching all these legacy farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: fall off left and right and Obviously by
quality first like the lower quality
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers are dropping off the mid quality
farmers are dropping off even people that
[SPEAKER_01]: grew pretty decent flower either Change
their practices based on how much money
[SPEAKER_01]: they could get out of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not getting three thousand a
pound anymore, you're getting you know 250
[SPEAKER_01]: to 500 a pound well all the practices they
used to grow good weed there They're not
[SPEAKER_01]: doing anymore because they're trying
they're trying to survive so all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: high-end flower on the outdoor scene is
Starting to fall off too and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to lose any good outdoor flower
that you can find I mean, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: find good outdoor weed Yeah, what all that
your others furthers the whole thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor is not good, which is like it's
stigmatizing Almost it's like I'm starting
[SPEAKER_01]: the self-ending cycle of like it's just
gonna try to burn itself out Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like the the snake that eats its tail
the the aura Boris it's just going around
[SPEAKER_00]: and continuing to eat itself and it's
never gonna stop Yeah, I agree with that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is unfortunate to see sort of some of
these trends that it almost It's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to break the cycles and these trends
that they've already started because as
[SPEAKER_00]: The price per pound goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can pivot away from more
expensive inputs less intensive farming
[SPEAKER_00]: practices but if it was those intensive
farming practices or the specific inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: or different things that you did to make
your farm work because as you know These
[SPEAKER_00]: are plants and they're growing and they're
alive and they need things to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they stay alive And if you start to
remove those different things Maybe your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants don't survive a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have a failed half crop or
something like that and Maybe that crop
[SPEAKER_00]: was what was needed to keep the lights on
or you know, oh 100% so So because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels like the way that things are
moving away from smaller growers being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to provide for their local community
to Larger scale growers providing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: more macro community Within each state and
and how home growing seems to be sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the last bastions of ability for
people to produce The medicine that they
[SPEAKER_00]: want or the cannabis that they want not
necessarily what's available on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be some advice that you would
give to new growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: based on Your successes and failures as a
grower yourself Advice I would give to new
[SPEAKER_01]: growers is Don't stop doing what you're
doing it's a very very easy to get
[SPEAKER_01]: discouraged to have a bad year and
Especially like if you care about what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing at the passion project and
you're doing this because you believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: it It's really easy to get disheartened
having a bad year Like you can have a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: year and your bad year can be sick like if
you're outdoor It could be six months long
[SPEAKER_01]: that you are just like and you don't want
to do it next year You know so like what
[SPEAKER_01]: if you choose to do if you choose to start
growing outdoor and you want to grow what
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to grow for you and then you need
to kind of take pride in that and like
[SPEAKER_01]: There are you're gonna take some hits to
the face You're gonna get knocked down and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like I mean you're gonna get you're
not gonna know what you're doing You're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get blindsided by pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna not know you're gonna kill a
plant You're gonna you know All these
[SPEAKER_01]: things are gonna happen and it's not
something that you need to stop doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: because of that like you need to like try
to remove the emotion from it and like
[SPEAKER_01]: Logically look at what you're doing
because when you put a bunch of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: effort into something especially like an
outdoor even what I do is Considered
[SPEAKER_01]: small, you know on the scale of outdoors
like it's easy to do like I mean you got
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep rolling with it Yeah,
it seems like Something that it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a repeat Advice for new growers is
don't let your failures Remain failures
[SPEAKER_00]: let them become a learning lesson so that
you can take that information That you
[SPEAKER_00]: gain within that failure so that you don't
then face those same failures again in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future 100% it's like the only you first
start growing it's like falling up the
[SPEAKER_01]: stairs Like you're gonna you're gonna hit
this you're gonna just keep fucking up
[SPEAKER_01]: until you end up to a spot where you have
something that you like kind of understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're doing and Like and like you
like we saw a touch on before you get one
[SPEAKER_01]: shot a year Don't let the first year that
you just completely fuck the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: up stop you from trying to get in the next
year For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like any other skill or practice
There's plenty of different books or ID
[SPEAKER_00]: ideologies that will say, you know You
need 10,000 hours of practice to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: master at something or you know a million
hours of Practice to become proficient at
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't forget the exact or I forget the
exact numbers but repetition and
[SPEAKER_00]: perseverance through a lot of these
different practices and aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation or what are what are going to
make you a better cultivator overall and
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you fail if you pick yourself
up dust yourself off and say That's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that to happen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I gonna prevent that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I failed and this is what I did
wrong Don't don't try to blame or figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out some reason why it wasn't what you did
Which I mean that's like that's generally
[SPEAKER_01]: in life too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can accept the responsibility you
can move on another thing I would offer to
[SPEAKER_01]: growers is Don't be afraid to ask
questions Because I don't know one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: jungle boys growers said that you can give
people the tech and they won't use it
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, like there's like some sort of ego
about growing and I don't understand Like
[SPEAKER_01]: how it works that no one wants to listen
to that other person and I'm sure you've
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced this like you could be like I
know what you're doing wrong change this
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well if you're not because I said
that you're not gonna do it now or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it may be like don't be afraid to
ask for advice and find somebody that does
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and Pick their brain because
especially with outdoor if someone like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing about a decade if you If
it's your first outdoor and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to somebody who's been doing it for
ten years Like that's gonna be your key to
[SPEAKER_01]: getting better quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're not gonna get the actual
experience doing it but like that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna like you're gonna learn don't do ABC
and D and then that's gonna keep you from
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's gonna bring in like your
success to be like I know I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: fail this way and I know I'm not gonna
screw it up this way like listen to people
[SPEAKER_01]: around you that have done it like don't be
too egocentric that you can't take advice
[SPEAKER_01]: from somebody because if you get one shot
a year it's gonna take a long time to get
[SPEAKER_01]: good and you might as well talk to
somebody who's done it and get some like
[SPEAKER_00]: take their input I was just gonna say
don't let pride and ego stand In your way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a this is a it's it's hard to grow
really good cannabis and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: because like the processes are hard but
because there's so many different aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: to it that can fail and without knowing
what those things are ahead of time or how
[SPEAKER_00]: to react to them you can have this sort of
snowball effect and Cause an avalanche to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall down on the grow around you without
setting up those proper barriers to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent it well that too and like and then
you talk about the whole atmosphere on
[SPEAKER_01]: line like from Instagram is like but it's
so egocentric to grow weed like and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't under like Mass scale it's like a
personal pride and like everybody's ego is
[SPEAKER_01]: literally tied to them growing weed That
like even new growers like even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: were to stumble upon Instagram Like this
is the vibe that the whole industry gives
[SPEAKER_01]: off and it's like this fuck you I'm the
best kind of vibe which I mean when you
[SPEAKER_01]: get people a lot of experience that we
have people are showing off and there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little there is ego in there and there is
You know pride in people's work,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like from an outside perspective you
were just trying to get into it Like
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at all like the way that people
think and act about cannabis Online is not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna help you in reality Like it's all
it's gonna do is hold you back and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of gatekeeping and like a like a
brainwash way That everyone acts like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're so good and you're never gonna get
to their level Which is not true at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mean, there's plenty of people that
are open to discussing and giving advice
[SPEAKER_01]: but like when you look at the grand vibe
of Everything online, it's telling you the
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite and don't you don't need to
believe that nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's it's the exact that is the exact
opposite of what's the truth to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: there are More people that are going to be
willing to teach you how to grow and help
[SPEAKER_00]: you along the way Especially when it comes
to trying to help fix something or trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to help prevent something or react to
something or Set up the best practices
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of time so that you don't run into
those issues, there's so many people that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to help new growers because Without
new growers getting into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it could eventually become something
stagnant that does go to only the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who can afford it and That's when we do
start to run into issues like we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about earlier of larger companies
being the only source for cannabis and if
[SPEAKER_00]: that what Can happen we want to try and
prevent that and by trying to prevent that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the best ways That we can
is by promoting home growers to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow and to do it as best as they
possibly can because It's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just as easy to produce enough for
yourself as it is to produce enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and a few other people and other
people see that you can produce it for
[SPEAKER_00]: them Maybe they want to get into it and it
can just spread and spread and spread and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully, you know, eventually,
you know I've heard other people say we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to overgrow the nation or there's
Just more growers than people know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So larger corporations don't have an
opportunity to enter the market because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just no demand Something like that
would be off 100% and that's like Kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't want to sound egocentric like
I can go down to the Spencerie and buy the
[SPEAKER_01]: most expensive weed there and the stuff
that I grow like blows it out of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: like and that's like we're what you don't
realize is like Or what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't realize is the like who Ever is
advertising you that they have the best
[SPEAKER_01]: weed at the dispensary or wherever is full
of shit in its marketing 90% of the time I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to say it always is like you're gonna
find stuff that's really good there But
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not gonna find it being advertised
very heavily and there's not gonna be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of it It's gonna be very niche
Definitely, you know, it's not hard to get
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll say it's not hard It's not
impossible to out compete a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growers Just from the reasons
like quality or yes terms of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard to out compete like from a
home grower aspect and that's what people
[SPEAKER_01]: need to realize too is that like People
talk a big game about a lot of the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in like the commercial sense
and like the legal industry But it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: hype hundred like not all of it But it's
there's a lot of fluff in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of people that don't know
what they're doing and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that have grew two years and now have a
job growing and like there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of a lack of legacy in that
market that like is not it's not hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: get up to where they're at It's not a lot
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, there's so much
accessible information online or through
[SPEAKER_00]: communities or forums or chat groups
Discords reddits Instagram pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a really good reddit page Yeah,
we know a pretty good reddit page art
[SPEAKER_00]: slash craft marijuana on reddit Check it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the better growers that you're
gonna find within the reddit cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sphere Yeah, you know this is basically
It's been a wonderful conversation and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate your insights into
organic home growing especially as it
[SPEAKER_00]: pertains to outdoor practices and
maintaining a specific level of quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and High expectations for what you want
out of the cannabis that you are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself So I just have a few little
wrap-up questions to ask And I like to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone so um, what's your favorite
strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite strain of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That's a hard question Favorite strain
of all time Chernobyl is one of them Lambs
[SPEAKER_01]: bread or breath is one of them and then
cinderella 99 is one of them and I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked the new cinderella 99 But like it's
hard to keep strains through the decades,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Like so what I might have been
saying is what one of my favorite Durban
[SPEAKER_01]: poison but Durban poison when I was in
like college like oh seven Not like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban I've seen now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so what Chernobyl?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinderella and Yeah, those are two of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some really good ones so then
With those being your favorite strains who
[SPEAKER_00]: would be your favorite breeder of all
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite breeder of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That's a hard one I have I have one
person that I really like based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: work that has grown and it's awesome
obsolete Obsolete is a really good breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: His stuff I try to collect auction seed
auctions get everything I can orange
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies is one of his strains I grow I
don't want to say it's one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: strains of all time But that is a very
very nice plant and there's some other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like orange fruity pebbles I've
grown him from him high octane.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a lot of good stuff Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool All right, and then just the
last little question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your most memorable cannabis
related?
[SPEAKER_01]: experience most memorable in a good or a
bad way I kind of want to tell my great
[SPEAKER_01]: story just so people that haven't weren't
around when this was a thing Understand
[SPEAKER_01]: this that sounds like it could be a
memorable story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very vulnerable So I worked at this
this the first job I had where I was
[SPEAKER_01]: running the farm and it was the one I told
you about Lake County So it was on the
[SPEAKER_01]: side of a mountain and it was off bottle
rock road If you want to look it up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Lake County, I think it's Kelseyville,
California So it's in the middle and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of in the middle Nowhere on the side
of this mountain and you had to drive this
[SPEAKER_01]: really long, you know, whiny fucking
gravel road They could barely get a car up
[SPEAKER_01]: to get there and I think it was mid-august
the late August and I like where I stayed
[SPEAKER_01]: was in the shack on the side this sounds
really stupid but there was a shack on the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain on stilts and so there was a like
a shed basically on top of these stilts
[SPEAKER_01]: and I remember sitting there one day and
it was probably noon it was like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of the day when I was hot so I was
inside and I heard a car I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recognize this car I don't
recognize the sound of this car And so I
[SPEAKER_01]: opened the door up to the shack and I look
out and I have a bunch of guys pointing
[SPEAKER_01]: AR-15s at me And so the sheriff had walked
up in front of the truck that was driving
[SPEAKER_01]: so they were already at the door So you
get the full rate experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're screaming at you pointing guns at
you telling you to get on the ground Like
[SPEAKER_01]: I get out of there and at the time I was
on the side of mountain So I didn't wear
[SPEAKER_01]: shoes the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hippie shit So I get out of the I go
out of the shack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're screaming at me to get on the
ground freeze They're asking me where my
[SPEAKER_01]: shoes are at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any shoes And they get up and
you know, they're the top guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so they arrest me and I'm
sitting there I'm shaking why they put me
[SPEAKER_01]: handcuffs and the guy looks at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, why are you why are you so
nervous?
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you nervous about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like I've never been arrested
before and you see the look in these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys's face just go from like they're you
know, they've got the bad guy to like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay and so They they handcuffed me they
put me up and they set me off to the side
[SPEAKER_01]: and they sit there with the they take the
side by side and everything that's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: property and it Takes them six hours to
cut all these plants down because their
[SPEAKER_01]: cage so they have me sitting there
watching them cut all these plants down
[SPEAKER_01]: the that I spent all your growing and
Dragging them in front of me and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: on this whole, you know production that
you know, they like you're you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know Shame on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all what we're doing It wasn't
that wasn't very fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's probably the most memorable
one I was with the one that impacted me
[SPEAKER_01]: the most I was saying a positive way,
but kind of seeing how you always hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about people getting Raided and you hear
about like the past, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the cops and the helicopters like
when you're involved in that That is like
[SPEAKER_01]: they they are fucking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That sounds quite terrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it was a little a little
traumatizing, but it definitely made an
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on me for sure Well, I mean it
seems like you made it out of there Some
[SPEAKER_00]: semi unscathed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make yes hundred percent It was a
whole it was a whole thing that ran on for
[SPEAKER_01]: about two years But yeah for anybody who's
watching that wasn't around in the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market days like getting Raided is
definitely a scary not fun experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we've kind of gotten past as a as
a Cannabis community and law enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: how well they don't interact together Wow
Well, I mean that is definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: memorable cannabis related experience that
you know, not a lot of people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to face nowadays, so Bringing up
Yeah, I'm happy to them that they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to experience that me too.
