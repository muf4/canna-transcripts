[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, this is Gabby Staten
Island with my friends Wolf and Cosmic
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlie and we're doing the Gabbing with
Gabby podcast today and I invited them to
[SPEAKER_01]: join because it's far more interesting to
have these guys with me than to me just
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna talk about a few things
today but I think the first thing I wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: start with is doing a little bit of a
response to the Not So Dog and Try Baby
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast that's on the future, man I should
remember, Future Cannabis, oh man that
[SPEAKER_01]: sucks, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Future Cannabis Project, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that's what I knew there was a reason
why I had Wolf here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Future Cannabis Project,
it's a great podcast, they have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different shows that they put on there and
one of them that they do is the Not So
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog, Try Baby podcast which I've been
glued to every week and I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: honored, they mentioned me a lot on the
podcast and I hope that they invite me to
[SPEAKER_01]: be on the show soon and I'm trying to get
Not So Dog to do this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: do a podcast with me as well because he's
part of my story but I did want to get out
[SPEAKER_01]: this response to their latest podcast
where, so Not So Dog in not the last
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast but the one before, one of the
things he talks about is how he believes
[SPEAKER_01]: the next set of elites are going to come
from home grows, small farms or accidents
[SPEAKER_01]: and after the podcast I called him up and
let him know that I didn't agree with him
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna play a video for you guys of what he
[SPEAKER_01]: said and then I'm gonna respond to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually what Try Baby said and so
here's that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaby actually disagreed with me so much,
he called me up to tell me about it right
[SPEAKER_02]: after the last show or whatever but I
think the next elites are all coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: small farms and garage size grows and
bedroom grows and tent grows and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: because those people are going to be
specifically looking for what we want,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is crazy to see someone and I like
Gaby's, but it's crazy to see someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: so much of what they love is based on
absolute random bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked up a fucking bag at this show
and it was dank and we fuck and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to see someone who's just
vehemently fucking against the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: that would happen again, especially when
there's probably some nod to using all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these random happenstance lines to make
these new fucking killers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing that I wanted to talk about
was Try Baby saying, and I'm gonna read it
[SPEAKER_01]: here, crazy to see someone who's
vehemently against the idea that this
[SPEAKER_01]: could happen again, meaning that I am
vehemently against the idea that the next
[SPEAKER_01]: elite strain would come from a home grow
or a small farm and that's just not the
[SPEAKER_01]: way I feel at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called Not-so-dog and I told him that I
wasn't so sure that that's where it would
[SPEAKER_01]: come from and I'm gonna talk about why in
a minute, but I think the first thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to discuss before we even go
there is what is an elite strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we define an elite strain and also
what is a strain of historical
[SPEAKER_01]: significance?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you tell me how you would define
an elite strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I think that I'll start off first
by talking about the history of the elite
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, I guess, or what that's meant in
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would like the first ones that
come to mind would be things like OG Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: or Chem Dog or like Girl Scout Cookies or
anything that kind of hit the market with
[SPEAKER_03]: like a splash almost, like something that
really made waves with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like if somebody had that when they
were coming to the smoke sesh,
[SPEAKER_03]: then they were the one that everyone was
kind of like, oh, they have that new stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: or that something special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not just, you know, whatever the
green stuff was or the purple stuff was
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would get the no name like it's
just you got option A or option B
[SPEAKER_03]: typically whenever I was like purchasing
anything back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then so then what do I think like the
future of elites are?
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I think that it does really come
down to what people are like what people
[SPEAKER_03]: are looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that sometimes when people
will say like, oh, the elites are whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: sells the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's really area dependent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just considering the use of
social media now and how information can
[SPEAKER_03]: travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be whatever has the best
almost marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the elite because it's
sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't matter if it yields well or
if its potency is across the board for
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone's endocannabinoids or even if the
profile is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like as long as it I feel like one
of the biggest things is it has to be
[SPEAKER_03]: glamorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has to be something that's
very photogenic and very nice to look at
[SPEAKER_03]: with with like the smoking end of it kind
of being secondary almost to what looks
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, there are still there's a lot
that's that looks good and smokes good and
[SPEAKER_03]: grows really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, like as a cultivator,
the elites are the ones that grow well,
[SPEAKER_03]: yield well and have easy trimming because
trimming is just one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: expenses for a like for each pound that
you produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trimming is going to be a significant
percentage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's going to be labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor and trimming are pretty much even
neck to neck in terms of the the cost per
[SPEAKER_03]: pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, organic or synthetic
after that is kind of set like tertiary
[SPEAKER_03]: almost to the those two front runners in
terms of price per what your production
[SPEAKER_03]: unit is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the end, I feel like the elites are
going to be the ones that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can continue with this downturned market
to be able to make people profitable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before I let Cosmic chime in prior
to those strains, there was Panama,
[SPEAKER_01]: red Colombian gold and tie stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those have never been referred to as
elites at the time, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elites is only something that's a current
term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those would have just been what's
available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what made that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to give up to too much of
what I think, but it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: also marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff became something that people
heard of and wanted, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like everybody wanted the Panama red of
the Colombian gold or the tie stick
[SPEAKER_01]: because the word got out for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead, Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear what you got to say as well
as your kitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: He keeps attacking me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I look off screen, that's what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of viewed like the strains,
especially before, you know, legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: happened, you know, recreational or even
medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is, you know, people didn't necessarily
know the growers or even there wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily any brands around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, really what the brand was was
the strain name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a driving force between,
you know, behind the popularity,
[SPEAKER_04]: not just, you know, the potency and the
turbines and everything like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but is how much profit it could bring the
grower when they decided to grow that
[SPEAKER_04]: particular cut, because, again,
they were breaking a lot of laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was a lot of risk
involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're not going to be wasting any
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: With strains that don't produce a lot or,
you know, Wolf, as you said, are taking a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of time to trim their labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're losing a lot of weight
that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that the, you know,
our original strains that we know very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very well, you know, like White Widow or
Bubba Kush or any of those kind of elite
[SPEAKER_04]: strains, it's because they were really
profitable for the grower to risk,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, any kind of jail time or any
kind of, you know, anything to happen that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it does have to do with, you know,
the brand recognition or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the strain, you know, because that's what
people know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, I want to get some AK-47 or
trainwreck or, you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also has to do with how good of a
cultivator it was for the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wholeheartedly with that, because,
you know, it's like the like elite is it
[SPEAKER_03]: has to be tied with the capitalistic
nature of the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have you you can only have an
elite strain if it makes you money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it by all other metrics,
it's not it's not going to meet any of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bar required to make it elite if it
doesn't produce well enough for for
[SPEAKER_03]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think both of you guys make really
good points because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: while some people may hate to hear this,
you know, it's kind of what you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a strain isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Profitable, if it doesn't make financial
sense, then, you know, people aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow as much of it and then it's not
going to get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, it can never reach
that elite status.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something that's a little bit
contrary to this is actually the chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: and something that, you know, not so dog
doesn't really mention in his podcast is
[SPEAKER_01]: we grew a very, very limited amount of
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is it didn't produce as
well as the skunk, you know, or other
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that we grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's actually surprising or
it maybe it took more time and effort for
[SPEAKER_01]: it to reach that status of an elite strain
because not that many people got their
[SPEAKER_01]: hands on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, you know, I'm going to get
to what my definition is of of an elite
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing an elite strain is not is
what you or I think is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, well, I think this strain
is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is that's just someone's opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, what makes a strain elite is when
it has when there's a large market for it
[SPEAKER_01]: and it lasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it has staying power.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for instance, probably the
most elite strain in my lifetime would be
[SPEAKER_01]: the Saudis.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because that strain was grown for the
longest time by the most amount of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had the highest demand and it actually
still today, it has a high demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that that I think goes
into play is, for instance, if you ask
[SPEAKER_01]: random people on the street, do they know
the sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people, even if they don't smoke
weed, they probably have heard of the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemdog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think would beat it out nowadays,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of people that actually smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but the other thing about that
is that runs is a more it's more modern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pressure on people's mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was something that I was going to
move on to a little bit later is I think
[SPEAKER_01]: while it's extremely controversial to say
this, and particularly in craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in our group on Reddit and Discord,
a lot of people would be offended that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say this, but lemon cherry gelato
and run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Runs are elite strengths.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, those strains get so much
hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like, oh, you know, doesn't get me
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this weed all tastes the same because
it's a million and one crosses with
[SPEAKER_01]: gelatos and runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and I think it's a big mistake that
breeders are doing today is just crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the cannabis is becoming very
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't deny a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, lemon cherry gelato is pretty
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's photogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has a great nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, maybe it doesn't get me as high as
other strains like OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the average consumer, that shit
gets them high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a cultivator, you can sell more
lemon cherry gelato or runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than anything else that you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I don't care how fire your OG is
today, but you can't sell it like you can
[SPEAKER_01]: sell packs of lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your weekend warriors, OG Kush is too
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the majority of the people don't
require something that's much more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like I said, I think it's
controversial to say, but lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: gelato and runs, those are the elite
strains of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you'll find any controversy
in this in this group right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I didn't get maybe I didn't get a
wide enough panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm not looking for like we're
talking before the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not looking to just have people on
that agree with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's just a lot of haters
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're an opposing opinion because I feel
like we see a lot within our the craft
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana subreddit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people, I think, hate on strains that
they don't have access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that it's about a status
symbol because of how much status matters
[SPEAKER_03]: to people in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you don't have access to something
that other people have access to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you feel as though you are not you're not
at that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and to grow something that is an elite
cut within the commercial side of things
[SPEAKER_03]: is to grow something that is like runs
lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's just too many now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just because we talked about those,
I think I'm blinking on so many more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's like so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, any any kind of strain,
anything that is like a cookie strain or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that's like a fizzy strain or
anything that's like a preferred garden
[SPEAKER_03]: strain or something that is like one of
these larger brand names that people can
[SPEAKER_03]: find in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they go, oh, I want to grow at
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: They buy seeds typically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't understand that the pheno
selecting process of these different elite
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars requires the pheno hunting of
hundreds, if not thousands of different
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they go, well, this isn't what I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't look as good as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, screw those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They they must have some secret thing that
they're keeping from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like it's just the cultivar and
cultivar meaning specifically like a tried
[SPEAKER_03]: and true tested production crop,
like not a seed is not a cultivar,
[SPEAKER_03]: a clone is a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you when you have people that
don't have access to these things,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do feel as though there is a little bit
of stigma that's raised where they say,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, well, you know, I think Girl Scout
Cookies has gotten the most hate or
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone say, oh, Girl Scout Cookies or
cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it got such good recognition
because if you smoked cookies in like
[SPEAKER_03]: 2009, that was the best cannabis you've
smoked in a decade because it was smooth
[SPEAKER_03]: and full and it wasn't crazy, racy high
like super silver haze or headband or
[SPEAKER_03]: something where you were like smoking that
and you were just not functional for part
[SPEAKER_03]: of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could like smoke it with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be social.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I don't know, that that's what
an elite cultivar to me is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when when people get frustrated at the
fact that they don't have access to it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's when it starts to have
this hate towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, it's good that we don't
agree on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Examples of of why I don't believe or
agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One clear one would be the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost no one has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never see any hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've yet to see one person say,
oh, the chem dog is meh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the of course it was comes
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: An empire was built in, but not maybe not
not as big, not as big as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cookies crew or or the jungle boys.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These different people, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's where the it's just that both
guys are big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hating on the big guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, for instance, succeeded in
ending those elite cuts to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I kind of agree with people
saying that maybe they're bored of the
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon cherry gelato, you know,
because there's so much stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although if there was 10 different strains
that were all similar to the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be in heaven right now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, GMO is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about what we're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is GMO sauce turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I what I can what I consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to do a little talk about what
are we smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get too far off the
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that animal tsunami?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to finish my thought process and my
response to the NASA dog crybaby podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we can go off and as far of a
tangent as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to make sure I don't
forget what the purpose of of me recording
[SPEAKER_01]: this today was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my thought on why the next elites
aren't going to come from or are less
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly do not vehemently oppose the
idea that the next elite could come from a
[SPEAKER_01]: home grower or a small breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, you know, what we had to do
and I think we've begun to do it was
[SPEAKER_01]: define what is an elite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, an elite strain is a strain
that has a large market demand and lasting
[SPEAKER_01]: power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back in the day, the only way
that we got new genetics were from these
[SPEAKER_01]: accidents or from small breeders or a seed
that somebody gave them that they had held
[SPEAKER_01]: on to for 20 years and somehow popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was the only way new stuff
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we have many breeders, including
Cosmic and I, and I'm not sure if Wolf
[SPEAKER_01]: does breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you know, we have a lot of
people that are trying hard to make new
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, I think that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hard work pays off and saying
that the next elites are all going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: from accidents or, you know, small growers
that find the seed somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think it's as likely today
because of how many people are putting the
[SPEAKER_01]: work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, is and we talked about
it before, is how the strains get
[SPEAKER_01]: marketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get the wide market demand and
the lasting power, you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it's unfortunate, these big
companies, that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Cookies is a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they did a good job of
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, you know, at least,
you know, the original Cookies has.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in my opinion, that is an elite
strain with historical significance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the first question that you
have to answer when you say when where's
[SPEAKER_01]: the next elite going to come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what is an elite?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told you what it means to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Nick and Cosmic also did it,
but I asked on my Instagram page and I
[SPEAKER_01]: also asked in a craft group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to read you some of the
responses because most of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's exactly how I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I'm not going to read you their
handles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to read the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most likely a personal cultivator that
finds something by accident, but sells
[SPEAKER_01]: early on for a big price tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elite strains are elite due to their being
passed only to the most trusted friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: growers with the condition that the plant
does not get distributed indiscriminately.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could basically render elite strains
defunct terms since the market could make
[SPEAKER_01]: the equivalent of yesterday's 10 K cuts
available to at least a thousand growers
[SPEAKER_01]: at ten dollars per cut with little to zero
legal issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it says, in my opinion, true actual
elites, meaning high quality, not value
[SPEAKER_01]: slash hype will be accents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have always been and then judged
and held by the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so far, we've got a couple of people
that believe that small growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is more of what I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The era has come to a close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strains no longer rise to the top due to
flavor and effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They likely used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growers used to grow what the people
demanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now strains become popular through
marketing and low cost per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Production.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I think the next big strains
will come from breeders who are market
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive and get the hype train rolling
hard from Instagram accounts with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sad, but true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure hobby growers find them,
but don't have the following to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then someone says, I think, like that
person said, I think home growers going to
[SPEAKER_01]: find something and he's going to sell a
cut to somebody who does have a following
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to claim it's theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few bag seeds for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hobby growers rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in the end, I think what's
going to do it is the marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a small home grower were to create
or find the next elite strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, probably his best path to get it
done would be to team up with somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: that's got the marketing behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess I want to just finish this
by saying discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certainly not vehemently opposed to
the idea that the next, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: big hit in cannabis could be an accident
or something that's found by a home grower
[SPEAKER_01]: or or bred by a small farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of me making this podcast is to
encourage everyone to grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think everyone should grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone should save seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if people are interested in it,
you know, doing some breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and feno hunting, this is all
extremely personally rewarding to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, to be honest, I didn't like
the the way my opinion was described.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just felt like it made it
sound like I'm all for corporate cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and that I think that corporate cannabis
rules and and they're the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make the best weed moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think logically, it makes sense when
you think about your average person now,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in states where, you know,
recreational is legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're not going to be going
to, you know, someone's cousin who has,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, who has some some nugs or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be going and finding,
you know, an actual legal establishment to
[SPEAKER_04]: make their purchases at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the products that they
offer are coming from those corporate
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it's.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really honestly, they do have a lot
of power there because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're already getting their products
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, for example, when, you know,
the location near me, Mr. Nice Guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I went in there, you know,
before a flight one time and I was talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to one of the bud tenders and I mentioned
I was going, you know, a place in Oregon
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're like, oh, well, why don't you
go check out one of our locations there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you think about that, you know,
a lot of times those companies are going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be dealing with, you know, same
distributors, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that distributor gets, you know,
a cut of something, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: their ability to get it out to a wide
variety of people and get that name
[SPEAKER_04]: recognition, it's way more powerful than,
you know, just someone who's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: selling buds out of their house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me think of the idea of marketing
being exposure, where if you're exposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: something, that's the best way to market
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, like, yeah, any legally compliant
area that also has multi-state operators
[SPEAKER_03]: in it are going to have the best
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are already kind of painted in
black.
[SPEAKER_03]: And white, we know exactly which companies
those are and exactly what sort of flower
[SPEAKER_03]: they produce and who they market towards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those are how we're going to see
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's where the elite cuts are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's just within that category.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't, I don't believe that it
means, though, that the only elite strains
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to come from those companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to be marketed by
those companies and that's where the
[SPEAKER_03]: popularity is going to come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think that they're the ones
that are finding them.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think there's a good
chance of either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if, you know, a small grower
finds the next great strain, their best
[SPEAKER_01]: route is to take it to a bigger company
with marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we said before, there are a lot
of people out there today trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: good work and breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, the idea that an accident or
somebody with far less experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with with also a lot smaller
library of genetics is likely to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: the next elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's less likely when we
found the chem dog and the sour diesel and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no corporate cannabis in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even when we were living under
215, it was still all, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: non-commercial in the sense of like it
wasn't a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was no brands.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that it's naive to think
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because a home grower or a small
grower cares more that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do something more than what a
company with resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so we got to remember,
too, all three of us are enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, your average person who likes to
smoke a joint every now and then,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they're not going to be able to
keep with those names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, I mean, even someone who's in the
community, it's tough to keep up with all
[SPEAKER_04]: these different strains that are coming
out all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so weren't as many strains back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I honestly think that the best
strains are going to come from people with
[SPEAKER_03]: the with the drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: To want to create something better or
something different or something unique
[SPEAKER_03]: that also then have the resources and
understanding of how to do that at a small
[SPEAKER_03]: scale to keep it very much focalized upon
what their goals are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, like someone that makes me think
of that, it would be like cosmic because
[SPEAKER_03]: you have the ability to tissue culture all
of these different strains that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing in so that you can have a vast
genetic library and a very small footprint
[SPEAKER_03]: with a very limited resource draw.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you can then tap into at any time to
try and pull flavor profiles out of to
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporate into the next wave of new
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, with tissue culture, you have the
ability to shelf phenol hunting projects
[SPEAKER_03]: without interrupting other projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of just slip in phenol hunts
anywhere you want and have the backups
[SPEAKER_03]: ready to go and ready to call,
depending on how your process goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be I feel like any
company now or any individual or any group
[SPEAKER_03]: that has the ability to do tissue culture
is going to be one of the very big parts
[SPEAKER_03]: of the future of elite genetic selection
just because of the overhead reduction
[SPEAKER_03]: because phenol hunting at commercial scale
is ridiculously expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also one of the reasons why I
don't think that the commercial industry
[SPEAKER_03]: actually has the resources to produce all
of the elite genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they will find some in the
phenol hunts that they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to do a hundred like phenol hunt,
like so if you're going to then try to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell packs out of that to pay for the
overhead of that run, you need a miracle
[SPEAKER_03]: of a buyer to be able to take that many
different looking packs, as well as like
[SPEAKER_03]: some of it's just not going to produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to be able to have that
factored in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, like the cost of running
a 100 light facility or 100 light room,
[SPEAKER_03]: for that matter, is going to be in a lot
of cases, if you don't have enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: cover that overhead, you're not going to
be able to turn on the electricity the
[SPEAKER_03]: following month.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that that much cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when a home grower who's a hobbyist has
the ability to phenol hunt 20 or 50 seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: at a time and do that four or five times a
year, I mean, regardless of how long the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual total phenol hunt and selection
process takes, that person's putting in a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot more work for a lot less money than
some of these commercial cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they have the ability to tissue
culture it on their own, then that
[SPEAKER_03]: person's a game changer in and of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can make waves by themselves as long
as they have partners within the
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial space that they can then get
their genetics into the hands of so that
[SPEAKER_03]: it can reach a larger a larger community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that Tasmec is kind of
like, he's the, he's an exception to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rule, at least for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for it is, like you said,
he's doing the tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he's still, you know, working on a
fairly small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, most people will be,
and you know what, me too, including me,
[SPEAKER_01]: are little intimidated by the idea of
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can send it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll, it'll walk you through the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done nodal tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the hardest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, Maristem is the hardest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nodal is great because then you can
proof things out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make sure that you have clean and
healthy genetics to start with,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you don't have to put a lot of money
and time into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, Maristem isn't that tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the hardest part is getting the
equipment because of how expensive it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think it's just like,
you know, I think, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick can chime in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just like in any part of
growing, or even, I know you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: musician, like you keep learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I'm never going to stop learning
about cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm never going to,
you know, you're never going to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be things left to
learn.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, you know, what I say is the day
you've got nothing left to learn,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you might as well leave this
earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, life, life is pretty boring,
you know, for those that think that they
[SPEAKER_01]: know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never be the smartest person in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sometimes you are, but it's
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but don't choose to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't choose to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny because like we
started this whole conversation,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about elite genetics and where
those are going to come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems as though to me, like the
elite genetics are going to come from
[SPEAKER_03]: groups of people having conversations like
these, because you have to be able to have
[SPEAKER_03]: the intelligence to produce elite flower
in order to determine if it's an elite
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so without the ability to understand
all these different processes,
[SPEAKER_03]: how are you going to make an educated
choice on your cultivation techniques that
[SPEAKER_03]: produce that time and time again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, in the past, it was
accidents, you know, like, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, happy accidents are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people win the lottery
sometimes, you know, but if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: counting on winning the lottery as,
as, you know, your plan to for the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just, you know, and yeah,
I believe that finding the next elite
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, that's just the way I see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I hope the next elite
strain is what my palate and my head
[SPEAKER_01]: thinks is an elite strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm different than most people,
you know, and, you know, this is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that not so dog was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, since we've gone this long
already, I want to make sure that I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I love their podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that they meant anything at
all by the way they mistook my opinion on
[SPEAKER_01]: the matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great thing for people to
experiment with cannabis, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and to keep learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding is a, is a really awesome thing
to do, but it's just more work than the
[SPEAKER_01]: average hobbyist is capable of to search
through everything to, to find that elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, like I said,
back in the day, that's all we had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like not so dog tells the story
about how he got the Mendo perps from he,
[SPEAKER_01]: he met a cancer patient and he gave him
some weed and the cancer patient gave him
[SPEAKER_01]: some seeds that he had for like 20 years
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And
[SPEAKER_01]: when Francis grew it and showed him the
weed, it turned out it wasn't even the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing the guy thought he was giving
him turned out to be something completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think those days are just
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those stories that I think are less
likely, like, you know, unfortunately I
[SPEAKER_01]: have, I have seen that 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the super booth cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's a great, uh,
contemporary story.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my answer to that is I love the super
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I don't know the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the name is one of the worst names in
cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, um, I know people that,
that try growing it on a commercial scale
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it checks every box.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strong nose, good high, looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yields great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This train should be an elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: People hate it out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody likes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't like the turf
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it because I want different stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, you know, I want it like,
I want to experience a new flavor like
[SPEAKER_01]: that every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, part of the reason why we liked
the chem dog is because it was different,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people that I know that,
that grew it out here, they had to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: and they had to start growing runs again
because they can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell the story about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell the story about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um, the guy that bred it is called
blockhead buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a, um, it's a single cultivar of
the block berry breeding project that he
[SPEAKER_03]: made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave the seeds to mobile J if you
know who mobile J is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, um, so he's just a really popular
Michigan grower, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he popped them thinking that they were
going to be boof because of the cross that
[SPEAKER_03]: went into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has like, um, it's like
Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I forget the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but of course at the time with Calio
being all played out and orange Terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of not really being a big
seller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the orange Terp, uh,
cannabis coming out like green and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: fluffy looking kind of like old Calio
would look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he just was like, well, this is going
to be super boof.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he grew it out and it ended up
being the like heaviest yielder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's seen in a while and, uh, hit the
markets well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, everyone started wanting to
grow super booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny because like the actual
breeder cut of block berry is way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, even, even the crosses off of
that now are just like, there's so much
[SPEAKER_03]: better than what the super booth is,
but it like the super booth because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: timing on it all and, um, how it hit the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of almost, uh, it became so
popular that it became a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I never actually became that popular
over here in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, but it was a nationwide popularity
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, uh, it was just being
grown in every state as it was coming
[SPEAKER_03]: online because it was, uh, a tested
yielder that could use the Athena program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anybody that was coming online could
just, uh, know how to feed it again,
[SPEAKER_03]: play and hit, you know, just, just plug in
3.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, follow their parameters out of the
handbook that was just released and hit
[SPEAKER_03]: three, three, a light, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just easy plug and play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told my buddy, I still think he should
grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is because he yielded
so much more than the runts that even if
[SPEAKER_01]: he took a lower price for the herb,
he still comes out on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is on top of taking a lower
price, it was still harder to sell coming
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the eliteness of runs,
you know, like, I mean, I wish the elite
[SPEAKER_01]: shit today was OG because this old guy,
this is what I like to smoke.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I can't, you know, even with
people that have the genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want to grow it because you
know, you get a lower price and harder to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell, you know, so in the right market,
it no longer becomes about grams per
[SPEAKER_03]: square foot yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes about dollars per square foot
purchased pretty much in every,
[SPEAKER_01]: in every market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people don't think that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think, Oh, I can produce three pounds
of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, yeah, but if you're
producing three pounds of light and you
[SPEAKER_03]: either have to sit on it or sell it low,
and if you can do two pounds of light,
[SPEAKER_03]: sell it all and sell it high.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're moving that product,
then you're doing a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you brought this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it leads me back to like some old
thoughts of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so back in the day, there was a time
when we had the chem dog and we had the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would always grow at least three
quarters of our garden, the skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a quarter of the garden,
the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chem dog would be for us to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would also be like to share among
skunks that are close friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we never sold it on a commercial
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, you know, at least not till
it passed my hands and VA skunk's hands
[SPEAKER_01]: when, you know, it got to some of the,
you know, guys that were like selling it
[SPEAKER_01]: at the dispensaries and stuff like that,
like Ben, trying to remember IC
[SPEAKER_01]: collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben started selling the stuff like more,
you know, on a mass scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But prior to that, I felt like nobody even
really knew what the chem dog was besides
[SPEAKER_01]: a small group of people, because we didn't
sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, that's why it's so
interesting that it actually made that
[SPEAKER_01]: elite status.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess in thinking about this,
the person that's really responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: this, and I should ask him to come and
talk with me with us is Ben from IC
[SPEAKER_01]: collective because he was the first person
to bring it to dispensaries, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and to really get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, prior to that, it was headstache
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but my point was the, how much
financial sense it made was a decision
[SPEAKER_01]: even back in the day when we were getting,
you know, over 6,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like, yeah, I mean,
I can tell stories about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had a very small grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But was getting over 6,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it easy, you know,
but even then it's like, we have to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour because, but not sour,
the skunk, because it gives us so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's a lot of hate
about like growing, you know, like
[SPEAKER_01]: choosing strains, like the lemon cherry
gelato because of like the financial sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that it makes to do it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was a factor even back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today there's way more people that are
just growing for themselves that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they don't have to make the
decisions on the financial aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have their four by four
ton, they don't sell the weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: they grow it, they smoke it, they give
some of it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's stuff left over, they throw it
in the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even fucking care.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, those people are growing because
they love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's funny because somebody
asked me what the best clone I had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, for them to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked them if, you know,
they need to, if this is a financial
[SPEAKER_01]: matter or if it's just for them
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, it's just for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the love of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, now you made it impossible
for me to answer your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now it's personal preference.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, how can I tell you what you're going
to like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell me what you like the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but, um, and I love that,
you know, and I think that there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: more people today that are growing,
you know, small gardens for their personal
[SPEAKER_01]: or for the love of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think that that's why maybe not
so dog and cry baby think that like these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys can be responsible for the next big
thing, you know, um, I think I said it
[SPEAKER_01]: before, there's a, there's a good chance
that it comes from something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you still got to team up with a bigger
company to market it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if it's going to be something
that's remembered, you know, for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, um, sorry, I was looking up a quote
really quick because this made me think of
[SPEAKER_03]: something and, uh, I thought the rest of
your life was calling.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a, it's a Margaret Mead quote that
says, never doubt that a small group of
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughtful, committed citizens can change
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only thing that has ever done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so that's why kind of, I think that
like these small dedicated home growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: home breeders, people that just have a
love for the plant, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that, that make the selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might not bring it to market,
but I think that that's going to be at
[SPEAKER_03]: least 90% of who make the selections in
terms of what is the next big thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: come to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, so you almost agree with not so dog,
because you think that's where it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always come from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're name one strain that came from a
large group that they hunted themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Name one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the answer that I was going to give
doesn't fit that completely, but to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still valid is the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't found by them, but it was found by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in his garage in San Francisco,
one person, one garage, one grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when people think about it in the end,
it took, it took cookies to make that an
[SPEAKER_01]: elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that, that's not the, that's not the
question, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is who's finding the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not who's bringing it to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, to me, I, I kind of
considered them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, so let's say given that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to get back into,
into debating the original topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, there is a good chance that
someone like cosmic here is going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: the next, um, the next great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to make the next great strain
or, or find it from a hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like how many seeds or clones,
you know, can he Fino hunt versus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody larger that has like,
like capital behind doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I feel like that's where I,
that's kind of where I was bringing up
[SPEAKER_03]: originally, when we were talking about it,
how like the overhead to actually run a
[SPEAKER_03]: Fino hunt and a large facility is so
extensive that a small individual that has
[SPEAKER_03]: the ability to tissue culture is going to
be at a greater advantage because they can
[SPEAKER_03]: have so many more strains than a small
space with a small overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except that a commercial operator could
use that same formula as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency, you know, so small operator
could still set up the tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: right here, um, could still set up the
tissue culture and do it efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you described like a, um,
you know, a large, uh, Fino hunt,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's a large or small company,
they could do a smaller Fino hunt more
[SPEAKER_01]: often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still get some type of results from
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, you know, I would think it
would be a good thing for farms to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dedicate this amount of space
for R and D, you know, we're going to test
[SPEAKER_01]: out as many strains as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we know what we're going to put
into the larger future rooms and
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to do that and factor it in
ahead of time because people that are just
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh, we need to do a Fino hunt right
now because we got to get something new in
[SPEAKER_03]: the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the people that are like,
they're their next quarter is riding on
[SPEAKER_03]: that Fino hunt in order to gain a higher
pack price to recoup the loss that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: running during that Fino hunt because they
are selling a pound here and a pound
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they're only producing a pound or
less per strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they're hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even within that, you have to,
you know, cherry pick the different,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the different flower that's going into
the packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that can simply be done is,
is it, it can be turned into fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, you're talking about
then still running margins that are so
[SPEAKER_03]: close at a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're, when you're talking about the
actual like total kilowatt hour usage per
[SPEAKER_03]: run versus how much you can gain for
concentrate that's and it's limited
[SPEAKER_03]: because then you also have to have someone
that you can sell it to for concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cause you're probably doing this
off season when most of the concentrate
[SPEAKER_03]: operators are running right now,
like in the fall, uh, as every heart,
[SPEAKER_03]: as the harvest is completed for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot to think about there and
you do have to find an outlet for the
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise it is going to be very,
very cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it costs right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it didn't cost everyone would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that it's, you know,
I think it's beneficial to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's safe to say that there's a lot of
variables that go into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, one thing I do want to bring up
too is, you know, finding, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a very social plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like playing the lottery and
yeah, the genetics that go behind,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever that, you know,
um, new strain is, you know, kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: dictates the level of, you know,
the potential of that plan, if you will,
[SPEAKER_04]: but.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes down to it, finding that
really special female, it can be like
[SPEAKER_04]: winning the lottery.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you can statistically win
the lottery with just one ticket,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like it's, uh, very unlikely,
but it's been known to happen,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I always view when I do like a
female hunt of like, are we going to win
[SPEAKER_04]: the lottery this time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to find something that's just
extremely unique or are we just going to
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of find the best representation of
both parents?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, getting those strains out there,
it's, there's a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just, it's what you do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, finding the plan is step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've thoroughly enjoyed this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should kind of bring it to a
close shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you guys want to add?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, yeah, I feel real life calling too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to get back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really wanted to thank both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wolf and cosmic for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can do more of this in the
future together because I think it's way
[SPEAKER_01]: more interesting when we don't all exactly
agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, um, I know Wolf and I are
going to try to do a podcast where we
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss the benefits of organic versus
inorganic gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I won't tell you what side either of
us are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can figure it out, but,
uh, but yeah, we're trying to find people
[SPEAKER_01]: on both sides of the debate to have a good
discussion about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we'll do this again soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys later.
[SPEAKER_01]: See ya.
