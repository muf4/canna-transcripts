[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Gabby Staten Island with our
Slovenian Hobbit, Sasha, and our guest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Vince Weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome to Your Weed Stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, on our last podcast with Vince,
we talked about his history and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, but we wanted to talk more
about what's going on in Germany and
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe as far as legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we wanted to have him back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think many Americans are completely
unaware of the situation in Europe and how
[SPEAKER_02]: things are progressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, as far as I'm aware, and Vince
will give us more information,
[SPEAKER_02]: they legalized cannabis and now they're
considering revoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just like a whole bunch of drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into the drama and welcome
Vince Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for the second
invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Germany, it's now exactly after
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my vape to get into the mood
for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you go any further, I wanted to
tell you, we got a tremendous response to
[SPEAKER_02]: our last video and people were asking
about the ball vapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went into my local head shop that I've
been shopping at since 1991 and they knew
[SPEAKER_02]: what a ball vape was, but they did not
have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I requested one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Hey, look, my buddy, Vincent Weed
said, I need to have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I'm trying to get my hands on a
ball vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, everybody is,
uh, looking at that thing and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, do you see the clouds?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's vaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see the clouds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so satisfying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, in the other episode when I
have been smoking 25 years pipe and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is my, my vegan, my vegan pipe
smoking now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing is,
um, what's, what's, uh, satisfying,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a little bit of pressure on the lungs
and a huge amount of vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the good thing is with the ball
vape, it's a one hit on point thermal
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the turps and cannabinoids get
really in once and it's a beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's not really, um,
something new, new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the technique behind that
it's old, but it's fought in a new way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, in Germany, the ball vape is,
it has really a hype at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy because out here, people don't
know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think of California as,
and you know, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: is being on the leading edge of this type
of stuff, but, uh, yeah, people don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The closest thing that I had to it and
it's nothing like it was there's a product
[SPEAKER_02]: from vapor brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wooden box and inside there's a,
an element that's covered with glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a bowl that's glass
attached to a hose and you put the hose
[SPEAKER_02]: right onto the heating element and you
draw on it and you get a nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, vape from flower, which, um,
you know, I really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what I do not like, which is more
popular out here is the volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're familiar with the volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about the volcano is the smoke
gets stale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it takes so long to fill
that bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by the time you consume it,
I just feel like, the flavor is affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say I'm very interested in getting
a ball vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a vape or the, the, when we say the
old school vapes, they have a long
[SPEAKER_01]: session.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes like five to seven minutes to
extract all the cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, this is with my ADHD,
it takes too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I use like the ball vape
or a diner vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all vapes which really
extract everything quick and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: take seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the volcano have also this,
uh, balloon and to be true, I never,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, fell, uh, had the feeling for this
vibe because when I'm sitting and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying cannabis, when I get this,
and the balloon is blowing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: it, no, it's not my type of consuming
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of the volcano at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spoke about cartridges last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you know what I have here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have to show you the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have vape cards made by myself in under
one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, and this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why it's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not made from hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made from flower rosin from pressing
the flower till having a consumable,
[SPEAKER_01]: consumable vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me one hour and 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the thing is, which is so mind
blowing is that when you see the quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is that the German community
is pushing hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wants to get out of his free plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can grow now, not with the
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they want to get out the maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my job as a cannabis educator is also
to onboard the people as easy as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: to different topics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you tell somebody to produce,
to wash hash, to dry the, it should dry
[SPEAKER_01]: the hash properly, then to press rosin
from hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to, to make your own cards,
but in Germany, because there is such a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge need to do it now by yourself,
because it's the only legal way.
[SPEAKER_01]: People also have been looking for a way to
get it out from flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the fire in fire out game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took some beautiful flowers from my
budget rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pressed it really as flower rosin,
and then I took a small jar and I decarbed
[SPEAKER_01]: the rosin and I home or the word in
English.
[SPEAKER_01]: I home and home would die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I homogenize in German, um, to how you
call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't can pronounce the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say it in English either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to, to make it home again,
you know, homogenize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that you get a little bit more
viscous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistency and the new cards can handle
that because it's no coil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a ceramic, um, part which heats up
the flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have the problem with all the
lipids and fats, which are also in
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this pen from pressing flowers to
consumption in one hour and 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will drop also a YouTube video about
that soon on my channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm interested in, um, are you
using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a, a rosin press like we have out
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, using a 10 ton press and I have it
since four years from one of my partners,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, Graveda it's called it's standing
exactly here behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, um, back in the day when rosin
first began, we were using like hair
[SPEAKER_02]: straightening irons to make rosin,
but you can't use fresh flower in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do it with hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, look, you can do go ahead and teach
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we recorded today, the episode for
YouTube, we thought about, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we make a video where we use the rosin
press, let's say 450 bucks, and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: also say we are using an infusing machine,
which can hold the temperature perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: other 250 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, ah, the, the onboarding
barrier, 600 bucks is quite high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did, and this is like,
I try to educate the people I told to my
[SPEAKER_01]: cameraman, let's try.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can make it with the hair
straightener, because the hair
[SPEAKER_01]: straightener, 10 bucks, the cartridge
under 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just need like a budget of 30
euros to make it with a, with a hair
[SPEAKER_01]: straightener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did it also with flower without
rosin bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we took a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we pressed it to a small ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this ball helps you pressing it
without a bag surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this we put between parchment paper and
the hair straightener and we pressed four
[SPEAKER_01]: grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we took all this flower rosin,
which is a little bit dirty because you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have the filtration for a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we activated that and that's now
in my rosin pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really did it with a low entry
barrier for the German community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you decarb it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you press the flower,
it's not viscous enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, uh, we placed it by 110 Celsius for
25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, during the cool down time,
it was still so liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we really could fill it in the pen
without a syringe or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how I love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll drop next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, send me a link and you know,
this video will take that much time to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it up as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and we will put the link in the
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you guys chat one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grab something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vince, what is the temperature you are
using when you're pressing with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: with your rosin press?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what, what do, where are you
normally with the temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I press a flower rosin between 75 and
80 Celsius for let's say 200 to 250
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, there I use the rosin press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I say, okay, the, the return,
the amount isn't important, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality must be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to show somebody really good,
good, good, good flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would say I also can lower it till
a 45 micron, but for sure the return
[SPEAKER_01]: drops.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and for hash, I would say there,
the thing is that the THCA get also into a
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid phase over 70 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with hash, you also have the
possibility to press it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes with a lower temperature,
like let's say 65, but also for hash
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would say I go somewhere between 65,
72, 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then with a 25 micron double
bagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question would be what is the
strains that you, that you press,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, which of those strains that you are
working on gives you the most or the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you have some favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that I'm growing now since
the 1st of April again, and I didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and I'm also not allowed to have
more than free, free cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not possible for me to build up a
library at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if, if there wouldn't be this barrier,
I, the first thing I would have done on
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1st of April to pop, I would say all
my seed stash, I was collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last, over the last few years,
and then making instantly a phenol hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: before I start to do other work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I, um, I had really to be quite
selective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I popped some beans from a batch of
rainbow and, um, from a Belgian,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, breeder OG and a J a J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, OG nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't can pronounce this new name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: His nickname usually is Tango on reverse,
but, um, that's another story and his
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, um, the batch show rainbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, um, uh, but show it's a
gelato, the, the melon and crossed with a
[SPEAKER_01]: rainbow belts crossed rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this strain was a really good
wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had luck from the first seats I popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like 5.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nearly 6% return by washing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely genetic and also by pressing
it to a rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's considered like super high end
yield for, for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I keep this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to imagine I'm allowed to grow
free plants and I'm growing just in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having the, the gelato as a mother,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already spread some clones to some
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be a genetic, I think a whip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Constantly working on the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share something with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a new cut of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how, how good you can see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the structure and I see the SD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see immediately the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the small folks telling Calyx coming
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exactly what reminds me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good old ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a rock man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend came over with this and he
said, Hey, you know, I want you to check
[SPEAKER_02]: out this sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before he opened up the jar,
I was like, Oh my God, that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the best sour diesel I've seen in
decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got the clones and I've been
smoking it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I, I, you know, as I talked
to the other shows, I, I use my vape pen a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot, but ever since I got this sour,
I've been smoking like five joints a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really need to get a ball vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really need a ball vape because that way I
would be like, I'd be like Vince smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: the ball vape, ball vape on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead I'm going to smoke these
joints and I want to do a free
[SPEAKER_02]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked this product and I know
you, you're not a big into smoking,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is called King Palms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know them and it's made from a Palm
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first saw it, I was like,
there's no way I'm going to like it
[SPEAKER_02]: because the leaf is, it's kind of thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I'm used to smoking with
thin rice papers, but I'll tell you,
[SPEAKER_02]: they smoke so smooth and, and cool,
you know, cause it doesn't allow it to
[SPEAKER_02]: burn so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a little bit embarrassing cause
you got to pack a pre-roll and I have this
[SPEAKER_02]: little funnel that I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make my joints, which is, it's
embarrassing when you're in public and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing that and people are like,
Oh, this guy can't roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually roll a joint, but I really
prefer these King Palms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they get them also in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elegant product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's an elegant product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to mute my microphone while I
roll my joints, but in the meantime,
[SPEAKER_02]: Vince started telling us your weed story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start telling us a little bit about the
state of cannabis in Germany and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started the episode with the
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't call it a legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, our.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a lot of ways that's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a lot of ways that's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not, not here in the U S
legalization has destroyed the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, make it not a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings in people and characters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a much better angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got your entire ball of vapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, you, you said at the
beginning, uh, how is going, how is the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization going on in Germany or in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will talk today about Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's not a legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a decriminalization, but in a German
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the law it's called cannabis cannabis
cannabis law in English.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the law starts by the words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is forbidden, but okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, they open, they opened,
um, or they decriminalized consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumption is now legal and cannabis is
still illegal, but under certain
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances, it's allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the circumstances are you are allowed
to grow free plants, but you are just
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to store at home 50 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you, we know everybody here
in the podcast knows that just with one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, we will get illegal again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is like, um, um, a tolerance,
like from 50 to 60, it's not, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: a felony, you would say in the States,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so it's not a big crime, but it's
already a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody who harvests more than 50
gram is still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are allowed to carry 25 grams on the
street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's with the outdoor growers who
want to grow completely holistic approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: full cycle with nature, using the energy
from the sun and store, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: At home the whole year, the whole year to
wait, to wash some hash and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is about hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the same limit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So extraction is not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have to be fucking German.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't call it extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy cannoli also said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't pull out with a, with a solvent,
something out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We separate the trichomes with sieving and
water and coke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a technical process,
but that's called for me separation now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is allowed, but then we come to
Rosen and there I bend the rules to the
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosen for me, no solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing a heat sieving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take something and we heat it up,
which we, before we can heat it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: we cooled it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we heat it up and we press it
again through a mesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we separate is the waxes and some
residues in the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can produce Rosen and to be
completely German, we don't call Rosen an
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because to concentrate something is the
different definition than extracting
[SPEAKER_01]: something and having an extract because
the German law had in mind when you read
[SPEAKER_01]: the law and bro, we have been reading the
law hundreds of time, each word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is one important thing in the,
in the part where they talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also written in the sentence,
something like to extract THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the straight mono component,
this is extracting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and this is how we, we ended up
with, we can talk a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_01]: that with a law, which is completely
unlogical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not fought from the
perspective of a cannabis consumer and
[SPEAKER_01]: from a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like, yeah, this is why we have
to be German.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't call it an extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you tell a little bit about the,
you know, how it actually they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard about it, that it will be a few
years of trying this law, like Zoila-eins,
[SPEAKER_00]: they call Zoila is the, is the,
in English you call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vince, can you tell a little bit about how
they actually scheduled the law?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they said it's going to be in
three phases, like the phase one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which already started, then it will,
because of five years of trying the law
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they will evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you tell a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, because I heard now that they just
don't want to go to step two, step three,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just want to have step one over,
you know, like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we stressing you out asking you these
questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you look like your mind is about to
explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to imagine the last two and a
half years we have been, we have been
[SPEAKER_01]: really in a law giving process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my daily thing was to read news and to
get headaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's a little bit messy,
this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and what Sasha was asking us,
they had three pillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to enroll afterwards each
pillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first pillar is decriminalization
or legalization of consumption,
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing the home grow, allowing clubs,
cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also there we can, we'll talk a little bit
about later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that you have, you are not allowed
to share cannabis with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine that we are not allowed to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not allowed to, to, to trade or to
give you a present.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely nonsense when you think about
cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beauty of sharing butts with other
growers or to share a joint or a pipe or a
[SPEAKER_01]: vape or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but what about somebody that can't
grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're sick and don't have a space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exactly the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are just able to get weed
legally by growing it yourself or from a
[SPEAKER_01]: club in the first act of enrolling this
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not a grower, you can't get
weed this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are no clubs or now it's the
first club opened, but we will talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit deeper about the situation with
the clubs in a few minutes, but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: no clubs at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't that the clubs had time to
pre start building facilities growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that from the moment we became legal,
it was also able to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not a grower in a club and to
get member in the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, because they also said they thought it
will be quicker to enroll, enroll the
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs, but it's such a huge project to
start a cannabis social club where they
[SPEAKER_01]: cut the ass out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not allowed to smoke together in the
club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not this cannabis social club.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cannabis club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, at the end, it's a facility which
grows the wheat and people can pick it up
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoke it alone at home and are not
allowed to share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the second pillar of the law is
that they wanted to start testing in
[SPEAKER_01]: different cities to open dispensaries
under a huge observation and evaluation
[SPEAKER_01]: and to see also how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third thing, this is far,
far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say 10 years in the future,
maybe seven, if it's quick, but I say 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years in the future that we will have
cannabis dispensaries where you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a member and where you can go
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the States, in some States after
work, bro, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring me some sherbet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will pick up a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's meet later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's in the far, far future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference between a social
club and a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be a member.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like talk about that works in
Spain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the problem is in Spain that the whole
club thing also have a lot of black market
[SPEAKER_01]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if we talk true, uh, if we want to be
a completely straight, what's going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain, they also are not allowed to earn
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but they somehow get the money out of
the club for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the thing is that in Germany,
they wanted to prevent this by giving the
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs just a small scalability.
[SPEAKER_01]: A club in Germany is limited by 500
members.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't scale it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it the same in Spain?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know how, but told me that
there was a limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of clubs give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they don't give it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, there's one thing about
having rules and then there's another
[SPEAKER_02]: thing by abiding the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you said something that you're not
allowed to give your friends weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if he's your friend, you know,
he's not going to tell the police,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, you know, it's, it's like,
you're not allowed to give weed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: To a cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, if I'm in German,
let me just say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go to Germany, I hope you'll give me
some weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I mean, I'm getting,
but you know, it's like, you just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to get one step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why this law is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under German and European and
international law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the argument, the, the, the punchline
is for this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want harm reduction for consumers and
society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have, this is the, the,
the, the, um, the spark for this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we come immediately in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't legalize because in this moment
we get in trouble in, on the European
[SPEAKER_01]: level, because there's also contracts that
all the European States will try to
[SPEAKER_01]: suppress drug trafficking and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the international law, it's the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the single convention and all
this stuff where if you are deeper into
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing movement, you know,
the countries who want to legalize have to
[SPEAKER_01]: get out of the single convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia, uh, did that for Coke leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, um, they bring the law
into, into, uh, work and then they get
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the contract and nobody says
something, but Germany wanted to be
[SPEAKER_01]: German.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they asked the European parliament if
it's, if it's fine to legalize completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't get the right response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they saw, okay, if we want to get this
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: With them, with the thought of harm
reduction for society and, and consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to make it like a trial because
then Germany was able to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: European union and say, okay, we will
bring this law and we will evaluate after
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our goal is to test if we can reduce
the harm by the end consumers because of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the ingredients, hairspray and
fertilizer, which I used to, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: to hire the, the, the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people here in Germany have been
smoking weed with has a hairspray and sand
[SPEAKER_01]: and metals just to, to have more weight on
the way wage to get more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will be evaluated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you know, uh, I've been around
for a minute and I've heard about a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff being added to weed, but never
hairspray.
[SPEAKER_01]: No look in, in, uh, uh, Sasha,
maybe you can help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his, uh, what means play in
English?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, can you maybe have a look because this
is something really important to tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the reason why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to grow 15 years ago when 20,
50 years and 15 years ago, it started that
[SPEAKER_01]: they laced weed with hairspray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They laced weed with crushed glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they crushed glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so dusty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they covered the, the butts and
it went till the thing that the growers in
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow already were putting stuff on the
butts when they were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's inside the bar and that the
weight of the whole harvest gets higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poisonous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let, let, let a whole city got,
got, um, poisoned by lead in the wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was, there was coming in the
batch of wheat into the city under the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market, which was laced with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fucking toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were smoking it and immediately the
people went into the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's going on or what's going on
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this is a good argument for the
politicians who wanted to legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we have to reduce the harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to give the people access to clean
wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we are, it's not legal, but it's
allowed the end consumer can grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By itself and now clubs are also starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now 120, 130 clubs in the making,
which will have each 500 members.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need like, if we want to supply
whole Germany, let's take calculate the
[SPEAKER_01]: home growers out and we just would use
clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would need like 5,000, 5,500 clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have in Germany, we say between 4.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 till 5, 6 million consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, bro, do you want to open a
club with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You will bring the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will bring my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's, it's more bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want, or do we, we have to open a
company or a structure which is under the
[SPEAKER_01]: same problems and hustle as building up a
real company because there are so many
[SPEAKER_01]: rules to build a club in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, the 500 members are just allowed each
person to pick up 50 grams a month and not
[SPEAKER_01]: in once because on the street in Germany,
you are just allowed to run around with 25
[SPEAKER_01]: G in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go twice to your club to
pick up your maximum amount of 50 G in the
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to sign that you are not in
the other club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really the, that the view of the
podcast and the listener understands
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government, the politicians who made
this law, they fought it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective of how can we reduce harm,
responsible consumption, and to push back
[SPEAKER_01]: the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from there, put perspective,
it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we, if we just allow them 50 grams,
which is from my perspective, from a non
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker, bro, 50 grams, it must be a
junkie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it's different, but if you smoke
pure 50 grams can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found a small 50 grams in the
next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and they're probably more and you
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just walking five joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's, that's just a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing they wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought if we limit that and we do
that and just, um, then we will reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that a consumer consumes what he
consumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing is if you,
if you allow the social thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that in our community,
I just can talk from what I am knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding me, if somebody has a problem
with cannabis and we think he should smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: for a couple of weeks, a little bit less,
I can tell him that because for me it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he's a friend or something like a
friend, this is nothing which occurs when
[SPEAKER_01]: you are in the bar drinking, bro,
you maybe should drink a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get drunk too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have a friend where I see that he
has some problem, problems in his head and
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to him and I tell him, please smoke
less because I see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we bring the consumption just that
everybody smokes by its own, we can't be
[SPEAKER_01]: together and have an eye on our
surrounding people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know what you're making me
realize?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're making me realize I have no
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's, no one's telling me to smoke
less, you know, I honestly, I'm lucky,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think about it myself,
you know, and I'm pretty open with the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that I'm abusing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's like, I just love it so much and
always want to be with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I know it's, it's abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, because I do it like,
I don't have to have a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit too often, or maybe
sometimes you smoke a joint because you
[SPEAKER_01]: love it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're still high, bro,
that's normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is what I say, if,
but that's abuse, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is that in, in my friend
circle, it was normal that when we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: that somebody wasn't on the line in his
life, we, as a friend, we talked to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other and sometimes it was also bro,
maybe you should stop smoking for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks or lower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's weird from our
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in other countries that I have
seen that because I'm German.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm living here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live here in the cannabis culture,
but, um, and that's something that kids
[SPEAKER_01]: will hear from their parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, you know, but when, when
legalization was on the horizon,
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that something, that there will
come some responsibility also with the
[SPEAKER_01]: reach, um, content creators have,
and I was quite lucky that I stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that I completely stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also smoked joints, but not at home
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, in the first episode,
and by that, I don't have to tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: people what to do or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm just as a role model and they talk
to me also in streams and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just give them an inspiration
to try a different way consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, for me, man, I have periods like
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important also to have an eye on
your buddies when they get a problem with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say, if you are settled in life,
everything runs well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your amount of cannabis you need or
you love to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go for it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, I have a quick change the
subject moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to get back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you know how many of your viewers
or listeners are from outside of Germany
[SPEAKER_02]: or Europe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how many people are listening to your
podcasts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in the U S is what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we go any further, I don't know
that I properly introduced Vince because
[SPEAKER_02]: he was on our last show, but you know,
Vince is, he's got a lot more experience
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this podcasting than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, um, he's influencing a lot of
people in Europe and Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has your, you know, YouTube channel is
Vince and weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to have to remind
me, I know it's the same on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with some funny letters to get
blocked, W free free D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of the ease, it's three,
three Vince W three, three D on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, because one thing I love about
doing this show is people are inspiring me
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and you are like, I, I think,
you know, what you do, that's exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just want to, I just want to
be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell people how I feel and,
and be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are very genuine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and also you're not like,
you have to do it my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like, look, you know,
maybe you should consider not smoking so
[SPEAKER_02]: much weed next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a, it's such a delicate approach
that you don't expect from Germans,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the U S look, um,
I would say something after this vape and
[SPEAKER_01]: dab, because this is a beauty of,
so here's some rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin weed, double dagger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the thing is really that,
um, when I gave myself the name Vincent
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, um, I did it because I have also
like, like a code with my community 24
[SPEAKER_01]: seven for 27 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 24 seven cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis concentrates in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I told the story a little
bit in the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to have it a little bit
deep, deeper, listen, the first episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I am living cannabis or like a legal
person also years before legalization in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, and I stand for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when legalization came,
my work load quad tripled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it went through the roof and I'm,
I, I was consuming so much cannabis that I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't form on the level I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went straight into a small cannabis
midlife crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was feeling the first time in my life
that at the moment I'm smoking definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 100 grams a month with a
little bit side extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't functioning on point with all
the, um, all the responsibility business,
[SPEAKER_01]: second company, family, um, all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had the problem that,
okay, I can't lower my weed consumption or
[SPEAKER_01]: stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Vincent weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was my inner, inner dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, bro, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed isn't good for you at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you have to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what will the people say?
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you are cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I said, okay, I have to take a
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel well, so I have to lower my
weed consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took the decision to communicate
that straight with my community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what came out of that, this is the
only moment I call myself an influencer
[SPEAKER_01]: when I really influence people for a
better living.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I call myself like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community feedback was outstanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: People said, bro, it's exactly what I'm in
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good that you say that I will do the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two, three, four, five weeks
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my streams, I stream really regularly
with my community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really close to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feedback came in, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little bit distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't stop, but I lowered and my life
is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see things from another perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use this moment to stop combusting
and all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the feedback was really, I was feeling
on the other side of the, of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the monitor in the stream that there
have been people affected positive by
[SPEAKER_01]: being completely truthful to myself and
don't hiding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm, I'm also truthful now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, okay, maybe I just will do,
I will tell them that I smoke and show it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but that's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now seven years in social media and I
never changed something for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't tell everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not private is private, but I am the
person I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like me, you like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, don't like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally fine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of think people that don't like you
must be dicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying this as an outsider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, analogy and sometimes it
doesn't fit and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also had to learn that my ego died so
many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone likes me to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, I being from New York,
I just feel like most people in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: would find that really offensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way New Yorkers act and talk,
even though I'm far removed New Yorker
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude that you think that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I can sum it up pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I think of a New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you live in New York city,
you have to be prepared to walk down the
[SPEAKER_02]: street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody bump into you and just not give a
shit because you're going to bump into so
[SPEAKER_02]: many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That if you have to stop and say,
I'm sorry, or excuse me, it's a major life
[SPEAKER_02]: sucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just so common.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in a different city and you bump
in somebody and you don't, and you give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit and this person gets offended because
it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even imagine anywhere else in the
world where that would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if you bump into somebody
and you say, excuse me, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you bump into somebody and just keep
walking like nothing ever happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get hit from the back of
the head or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just like, that's even more
rude than bumping into someone is just not
[SPEAKER_02]: giving a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, I have family in New York,
but I also have family in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never really want to go back except
to see family and pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pizza is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I am really, this is on my list to
visit New York again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was maybe 15, 20 years the last time
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I want to get back to the
legalization stuff, but at the same point,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure we have enough time
for these stories to, because it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's one thing to tell about, you know,
what the state of cannabis is in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we do want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing to get to know
who Vincent and weed is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, that's just far more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to make sure that we spend a
little time doing both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me think about what is definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, let me think about what's definitely
important that the listener of your show
[SPEAKER_01]: should know about German legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, where my heart is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumping because it's so beautiful to see
the home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are pushing out such a beautiful
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw the culture getting through the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, like I said last time,
everywhere you see sash people sharing,
[SPEAKER_01]: having a great time and living the first
time this feeling, I don't have to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, we have a situation at the moment
where the people are afraid that they will
[SPEAKER_01]: take that again away from us because the,
the government who legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had huge problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have problems in the world and this
problems resulted in that they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: finish their, their four years of how you
call it, the legacy legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have now new elections a little bit
earlier and we have the problem here also
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe that the, the politician,
political landscape became quite extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the situation in Germany that
we see a shift to, and I don't want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into it, to more conservative
parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this conservative parties,
they say we want to, they really say that
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to re re how you call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, rewind, not, um, to make it backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you say that in English to undo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to, to, uh, to, to take away the
legalization again or the
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you say that in English enough logical
sentence just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the thing is, I don't think that
it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to think about also if,
and this is the beauty of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: democracy, 4.5 million people in a state
of 85 million is what per definition,
[SPEAKER_01]: a minority, the cannabis consumers in
Germany are minority, but they became a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a huge work for the politicians to
implement this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why democracy works a
minority.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis consumers got their
legalization to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, um, with the new elections,
the people think that the conservative
[SPEAKER_01]: parties will take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, look, they also
conservative people are smoking wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you will take the law away,
you will criminalize instantly 4.5
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of people again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that this will work with
society because now they saw that this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that my neighbor where it was smelling
like wheat, he, and now he's legal and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's not becoming a crazy person by
smoking wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's a criminal again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this will be afford also with a
lot of people which don't consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and also to take a law.
[SPEAKER_01]: A way isn't that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will get into rough water in the
next years and we don't will get an
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement of our unfinished cannabis
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will be my perspective for the
next years?
[SPEAKER_01]: We will fight in the new room we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, we just will be able to work with
this law and this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I said that we will have to work
with this law for the next years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say five, seven, 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it will be really a fight between
the conservative and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to, to interpret, to interpret
sometimes my English to, um, see how the
[SPEAKER_01]: words we have to, um, bro, how can we say
that in English?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how we see the written law.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have to, to push the boundaries a
little bit more to the left?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The example is hash and extraction or is
it a separation?
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be stuff we will fight in front
of the court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to my words.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will fight for so many things that will
P there will be people sharing weeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: we will have to fight that this will
become legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have to keep fighting that hash,
not that hash, but that rosin stays legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not clear that it stays legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fight for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be crazy, but yeah, this is a
little bit of the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that we will get,
um, taking away this decriminalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't believe that we will have
improvements in the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when legalization happened here
or even prior to legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: when there was the medical marijuana,
there was silly rules as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it, it took time for,
for things to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the fact that they're being
deliberate, like the way you described it
[SPEAKER_02]: at the beginning, that they're really
trying to think things through and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and reflect on what's going on sounds
positive at least, um, the rate of things
[SPEAKER_02]: happening is obviously painfully slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the biggest frustration is
like the ebb and flow of what the politics
[SPEAKER_02]: wants for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like here in the U S once the
door is open, it's so wide open.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rush of people running through
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't close it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's, it's hard to understand
how a law could change so dramatically,
[SPEAKER_02]: so quickly back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, that doesn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not progress.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in a, in a, sorry for the
listeners in other countries, but in a
[SPEAKER_01]: working democracy, it's not that easy till
close to impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: To re purpose a new law again,
backwards instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have this institutional rights,
which were some, where a single person
[SPEAKER_01]: gets so much power to go there and say,
no, that's not reality anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, I'm really, uh,
fighting for democracy and this is why I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit relaxed because I know this
is still working here in Germany.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, what's the deal with,
you know, in the U S what drives this
[SPEAKER_02]: entire thing through legalization is money
and the government makes money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't say important argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they want to get their taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, they get their taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want to be drinking like,
you know, the gluttonous pigs that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know that we used the money because
look, I studied economics and I studied
[SPEAKER_01]: economics because I wanted a long time
ago, become a politician.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understood that we don't need,
we don't need, uh, we need everybody in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pilot in a political area,
but, um, we also need people who
[SPEAKER_01]: understand economics, law, laws,
society, everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I said, not that much people
understand the economy and the economy is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most influential part for the
politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's by that, I was saying all the
time, we have to use the argument,
[SPEAKER_01]: earning money for the government to our,
um, benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a really important step in
the German legalized movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the they have followed the German
hemp, um, group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a company, but they make lobbying for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They raised to pay, uh, how can you say
that in English?
[SPEAKER_01]: To pay, um, a consultant from the German
government and experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was already have been used the last
years by the German government.
[SPEAKER_01]: They raised money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went with this money to this expert
who is consulting the German government
[SPEAKER_01]: and said to them, please make a study.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money Germany would make when we
legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why by using an expert, the German
government was using already by themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: for other topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, okay, he's an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because he comes with a new topic,
cannabis, we can't, uh, tell her,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, say no, now you're not an expert
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made a study that if we legalize,
I don't have the numbers in my mind at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment that we will save like 4.5 billion
a year with all the effects of tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, lowered, um, uh, police work,
less work in the court, less people in
[SPEAKER_01]: prison and all this effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was an important thing also to
show the people who maybe haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: convinced by social improvement of a
legalization by money improvement for the
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the weapons from the government
against them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm pretty confident that that's
the way it works in all countries that
[SPEAKER_02]: have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the government makes money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they're interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're, if they're not making money,
you know, they're getting money from the
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol lobbies here in the U S you know,
I mean, and pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only reason why, you know,
this is allowed is and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: conservative is like money too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to, to highlight a few
politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the names are Bokat Blienart,
um, Carmen Vega and Dirk Heidenblut.
[SPEAKER_01]: This three politicians, and also there are
more, but this have been the visible
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians which did it really from
their, from their bottom of their heart
[SPEAKER_01]: because they understand understood that
there are people becoming criminals with
[SPEAKER_01]: no reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there have been also some politicians
who fight it for our movement because
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they, they are no consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I switched it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have crickets.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This politicians really fight it for
cannabis without the money in their mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it because they believed that we
really have to reach the point of harm
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction for society.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe, you know, obviously there
should be more of those, but it's just way
[SPEAKER_02]: easier to make the progress that we want
to make when they have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: government has the financial incentives,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but unfortunately, it's,
uh, this is something, this is why I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit tired at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you started to talk about the
political and legalization part,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have so much respect for people who
are fighting since decades for this plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I would say I'm fighting 10 years
with a lot of investment of my energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so drowning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy drowning and it's depressing to,
to, to read all the time political stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: because it makes something with your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sometimes I, I also prefer not to know
so much about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some joints would be a little bit
more relaxing and, but, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I have to use cannabis to get
through all this bullshit from politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually it wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, it is very depending on the
manipulation aspect of politicians in
[SPEAKER_00]: these moments right now, because,
you know, uh, as you said before,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is very much impossible to change the
law back in a, in a fast way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I would say is civil
disobedience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would, that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it will be much bigger problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the government, which they know
they're just playing around with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with this is always politics does it all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like filling time or filling time
with manipulation all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: relying a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis will the green wall
will fall in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this, there are so many connected
effects, also the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can remember when we had like,
two States in the, in, in the U S yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you look on the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have we come?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have we come today?
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's nearly 50, 50, or a little bit
more of 52% of the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which is the situation now in
America, but, and also in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: your home country is also thinking about
to change something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, okay, you are waiting that
something happens, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's such a small development and
changing the society and it's slowly step
[SPEAKER_01]: by step.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never, we never can start to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we want it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really slowly steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the grandma see that their nephew
doesn't get crazy by smoking a joint on
[SPEAKER_01]: the, on the family party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my parents, the same at the
beginning, 25 years ago, they thought I
[SPEAKER_01]: will ruin my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said to friends, how my son is
smoking weed and I am so afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today it's yeah, my son is a
successful family father working his ass
[SPEAKER_01]: off and yeah, and he doesn't have a
problem with cannabis and it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, this went through the friend
circle of my parents and it changed here
[SPEAKER_01]: and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opinions also from non cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And slowly, slowly, I'm positive all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also if it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion also is that other countries in
Europe will follow German model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they will this, there is no way
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years will take and Germany will see
it and they cannot, they will have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the progress, you know, and also the data
will come out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data, the criminality dropped that
there is a lot, how much money was,
[SPEAKER_00]: was saved by not that the police does not
do these rates anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like these data will come now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The politicians can lie on TV about it
that it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when, when, when real experts will
come out with this data, it will be over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot, you know, they will not lie
more about it because they can't then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but you're waiting for,
for those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't trust any statistic you
didn't faked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really can invite you to come to
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful to, to see what's going on
here with the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is in the summer, the biggest
cannabis exports called Mary Jane and so
[SPEAKER_01]: many satellite events, so many sessions,
cups, venues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really use, I think, I don't know
how is it in, in states where it's now
[SPEAKER_01]: legal since years, but in Germany,
the people are starving to live this
[SPEAKER_01]: culture together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sasha is trying to convince me to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got to figure out how to.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good growers and also the extraction,
um, the concentration artists to be
[SPEAKER_01]: German, not the extraction artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of rosin skyrocketed in the
last nine months from really.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of flower rosin on the home grower
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, bro, now I wash my harvest or I wash
a whole plant and I go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful to, to watch the people master
the craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know some people that are doing the
dry sifting also?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only the, do you know some people that
do the dry sifting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a little bit different,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are they using?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's another art.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people are experimenting a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can expect a lot of
innovation from the Germans in the
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same would have happened in all the
other legal states in the U S but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the German engineering mindset is
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, they are working already there
as of to bring a lot of helpful devices
[SPEAKER_01]: and innovation to the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell a little bit about the
Barcelona fair?
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you go to Spanobis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that because I follow you also last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw live from you were stopping him and
you just admitted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, he's a personality of kind of this
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I, of course, uh, he had,
he has life appearances during Spanobis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm also there, you know,
I, sometimes I look out for these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: people to just to see, eh, wins.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is what, uh, the cannabis
community is all about to connect,
[SPEAKER_01]: to learn and exchange with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the Spanobis is a beautiful,
beautiful event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the last years, Spain was a little
bit ahead of Germany with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, the Spanobis, which is every
year in the middle of March was the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the come together for the whole European
cannabis scene market culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last years, the Americans,
because they companies from the States
[SPEAKER_01]: also interested in the European market,
they came and more companies from the
[SPEAKER_01]: States came and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really.
[SPEAKER_01]: The perfect cannabis expo week,
because in Barcelona, a beautiful city
[SPEAKER_01]: with good food, you can pay, you can
afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in March, the first warm sun,
sun comes out in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have all the kind of social
clubs, like 400 in the whole city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a vibe everywhere, everywhere,
a little bit high everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see cannabis related people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to so many events, you enjoy the
beach, you smoke good and you go to an
[SPEAKER_01]: expo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we get also our Mary Jane in
Germany, quite big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the companies which went also to the
Spanobis are now coming to Germany by that
[SPEAKER_01]: something changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for me, for business, the German.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mary Jane is better because it's my
home town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's a, how you say in
football, it's a, if you, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: home game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, I will go this year to the
Spanobis and to enjoy more the vibe and
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to the expo three days and going
there more a little bit as a tourist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you mentioned about Barcelona is
the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's so warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I love that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went to Barcelona, I was like,
this might be the only city in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: that I could live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I, I don't live in the city
right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I don't want to live in LA,
London.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Berlin, I don't, I don't want to
live in a big, but Barcelona is a special
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, and I think the biggest thing for me
is the people there are pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you, you meet family,
not friends, you know, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh my God, it's like these people are my
family forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I definitely, I really,
everybody also, if it's for a trip to
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, visit Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will fall in love for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely my number one city in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that comes Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really come to Germany also in June,
June is our biggest expo in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody wants to experience the German
cannabis culture, it's the best moment to
[SPEAKER_01]: come to the Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead, Sasha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, uh, me as non-German,
if I come to Germany and smoke weed is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it still, I mean, it's just for Germans
to have 25 grams with you or also me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenian hobbit coming to your place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, you know, it would be
unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to not to just have you Germans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you are legal as a human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, the thing is if you come to
Germany as a, as a tourist and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in your pocket and the police asks
you where you got it from, the best thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is, yeah, that that's a problem because
they can say, okay, you are not living in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't been growing it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not allowed to be a club member in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you bought it on the black market,
which is still illegal, but to be true,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, you can smoke and look in
Berlin, nothing will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing in the, in, in the South,
in Munich, maybe, but it's more to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to bully you because they don't will send
something to your country's government
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have been consuming cannabis
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and one more thing I wanted to ask you
that I've been contacted by a fair in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany for, for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I want to participate on the fair
as a producer of, you know, as a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to them, I'm a producer of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask them if I can drive with
like thousand clones in my van to Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: with, with the plant passport that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they did not know me giving an
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they, they, it was like
tricky because if I go through Bavaria,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with the van, with, with
thousand clones in the back, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we come again to the German stupid
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, just the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: The definition of a cannabis plant is a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: With pistols in flower or with sex
expression in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought that a cutting or clone is
by this definition, not a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cannabis plants are allowed in a
certain way, but not legal, but seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cuttings should be legal by the German
new law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is in the moment you put the
cutting into soil, even if it's just such
[SPEAKER_01]: a small container, we still thought that
we could win the argument that it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant because it's not flowering
and it's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the BS is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That a lot of people got raided at home
and they had cuttings and small container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the, the court said, yeah,
it's a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are stucking in the fight with
arguments, which the problem is we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: fight as a community on one point,
focusing our energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fight is, um, is fight it by each
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which got in problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so the, to answer your question,
to come to Germany with 3000 plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: small containers of soil would be illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bring them in rock wool,
maybe then the thing is if it's legal in
[SPEAKER_01]: your state, in your country where you're
coming from, you don't have to expect any
[SPEAKER_01]: persecution, even if you get something in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go with rock wool, just rooted gray
area, try to take it away from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another question is, which we're
following this, this, how is it possible
[SPEAKER_00]: that I, as a non-German citizen could sell
clones in Germany, but you as Germans
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, because when, if I want to,
first of all, if the judge says also a
[SPEAKER_01]: small plant in the smallest possible
container with soil as a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the other problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if, if the judge says, okay,
I get your argumentation that your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are still in rock wool, just rooted,
let's call it a cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where did you cut that from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, you have a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an old plant in a big pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if, oh, I see pre-flower,
sorry, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were allowed to have a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were allowed to have three,
three, but not for, as a private person at
[SPEAKER_01]: home, not in your company facility for
production and economical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it's fucking Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's ridiculous because others,
other countries can sell close to your
[SPEAKER_00]: country, but you as German citizens are
not allowed to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a law.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something is legal in other countries
of Europe, it should be legal to transport
[SPEAKER_01]: through whole Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with cannabis, it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus Maria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we spoke about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the penalties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, as far as if you have
more than that 50 some odd grams,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you said a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal, but you know,
it starts low and it increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like there are different types of
penalties also for the clubs can get
[SPEAKER_01]: penalties.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't follow the rules and it's,
um, I would say if, if you really stay
[SPEAKER_01]: between the 50 and 60 gram, it's more,
and when you are above 60 gram,
[SPEAKER_01]: the law still will try to fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there are judges who.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it and say, no, I don't take the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let it fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine, but this is nothing you can
rely on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's illegal still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the situation we are living in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the penalty is vague.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, if you were growing five
or six plants, instead of the three plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're allowed, you don't really know
what you'd be facing the penalties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what judge you appear in
front of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a fine 700 euros, something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, because they have, they have a
sneaky way to fist you in the moment you
[SPEAKER_01]: get in front of the court.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, they fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let you pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fine, but then they come from the back
door with the fucking driver license and
[SPEAKER_01]: they take your driver license away because
they make a test and then you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, more than the allowed amount in your
blood because the level is really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they say, okay, yeah,
just 700 euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you're a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we, we think you are not capable of
differentiate between driving sober or
[SPEAKER_01]: driving high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, um, proof us that you are
capable of, um, separating that and that
[SPEAKER_01]: you are responsible consumer and they take
your license away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole process is not just the fact
that you are not able to drive to work or
[SPEAKER_01]: to, um, drive your kids to sport or to
make the grocery, a grocery, then also it
[SPEAKER_01]: costs you between, let's say free till
sometimes six, 7,000 euros to make tests,
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay the lawyer, all this BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, this is still the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than the 700 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more than the seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you don't have a driving
license and it's just that alone,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can understand that it's in
Germany, you're allowed to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: Oktoberfest all weekend long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Monday get on the Autobahn.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when they, when they stop you and
you have 100 bottles of vodka in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trunk, they don't assume that you have an
eye cold problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't smell, you can say it's for
the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, I buy it for the next three years
and nobody will question that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment you, oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in the moment, in the moment you have
a little bit too much cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are a criminal again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, by the way, my wife is waiting
for dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is now my wife called me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we could talk for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we can talk for hours again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like definitely do it again and then talk
a little bit more about genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, smoking, dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this stuff, what we love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the reason why we do all and
get all through this pain of legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: movement and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you, can you put me through one more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just want to go back and ask the
one question and then I'll let you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never answered how much of your
audience is from the U S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not on YouTube, not really that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people living in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all in it's all in German,
all in German.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I took a decision seven years ago
when I started YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I YouTube wasn't that what it is today,
but I asked the question on English.
[SPEAKER_01]: The English community has already so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for sure it was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do it in English, which isn't perfect
by the way, um, I will compete with the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole English creators and I will miss out
my local community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the decision was quite fast said German
lower reach internationally, definitely,
[SPEAKER_01]: but serving my community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the best decision of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely to make it in German.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I won't argue with the second half
of what you said about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: giving to your community, doing it for
your community, and also the time that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would take to do it, you know,
in an other language, I just feel that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I'm enjoying talking with you and
hearing what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think other people would too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reach is important, not like for
a, you know, financial response,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just so earlier you said something and
I'll I'm going to end the show with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that there was one time that you
were an actual influencer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to say what I said the last
time is that you inspired people because
[SPEAKER_02]: when you influence something, that's just
like a minor push.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's temporary, but when you inspire
people, that's something that's long-term,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and you know, I'm a podcaster
and the U S would I see you as competition
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, never.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would see you as inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and so I personally want to see
you do more in English.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think you, I think it's
important to, you know, you have a valid
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective to give to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So selfishly, I'd like you to see you
dedicate a little bit more of your time to
[SPEAKER_02]: English.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to be, you know,
if you want it to be on our show,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I, like I said,
I'm enjoying listening to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we can schedule it again real soon
because I don't feel like we ever come
[SPEAKER_02]: close to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like when you're just with
friends, the conversation doesn't end,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every weekend we get together and we just
talk again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I'm, I'm super grateful that
we got to spend this time with you,
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you inspired me about a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really kind words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really let's come again together and
then go really into the childish passion,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is burning all the time in our
hearts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really, um, yeah, today was to be
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really for me, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, at the moment, I stay away from
politics and I, I have to a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: it's responsibility, but I'm focusing on
the garden and other projects that will
[SPEAKER_01]: come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we, we did our, uh, episode on the
politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk Terps.
Okay.
