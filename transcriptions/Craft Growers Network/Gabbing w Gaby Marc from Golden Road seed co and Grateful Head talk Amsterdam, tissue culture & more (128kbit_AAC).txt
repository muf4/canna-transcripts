[SPEAKER_03]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_03]: Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeds, and they are the only place
that you can get the Gabby Staten Island
[SPEAKER_03]: collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Gabby Staten Island, and this is
the Craft Growers Network, and we have an
[SPEAKER_04]: exciting interview today with Mark Gallo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, howdy, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here and chop it up,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Mark Gallo from the Golden Road Seed
Company, and I work with the Grateful Head
[SPEAKER_01]: LLC, which we'll be delving into a little
bit during the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are my co-hosts, my Slovenian
Habit brother, also known as Sasha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and Sasha, tell everybody a
little bit about yourself before we get
[SPEAKER_04]: started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met Gabby like, what is it now?
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 days ago over Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been connecting like,
you don't connect normally like this every
[SPEAKER_06]: day to somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I instantly also knew that he's a
brother, you know, from another mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you know, this is our
generation, I think, is one of these
[SPEAKER_06]: generations that lived through some times
that if you know somebody, you don't need
[SPEAKER_06]: to hear a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's just natural.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this chemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, after these two podcasts
now, I'm really, I mean, it's normalized
[SPEAKER_06]: now for me that we are communicating so
much actually, because like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to maintain this all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really happy that you invite me
all the time to this podcast, because I
[SPEAKER_06]: think I represent a lot of the Europeans,
growers and craft people in cannabis that
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe should also have a voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the future, I think there will be
others that will join the conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: International connectivity through the
plant we love is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also have Nick Wolfe here
joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I met Nick through the craft marijuana
Reddit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started communicating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was similar to my relationship with
my Slovenian Hobbit brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, when we started talking,
I just, I wanted to know more about him
[SPEAKER_04]: and he helped me with our first podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super grateful for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he really contributes to what
we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll actually tell a little bit about
what you're doing as well, Nick,
[SPEAKER_04]: while I lower my heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm Nick Wolfe or Mr. Wolfe Grows on
Instagram and Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a moderator for the craft
marijuana subreddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm a manager or one of the
cultivation managers for a TA cultivators
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a small indoor with a two acre
outdoor that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm a hobbyist enthusiast for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have one more person joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Cosmic.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a company called Cosmic Strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's kind of our producer here.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us are getting paid for doing this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he has other responsibilities he has to
tend to, but hopefully he will join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: He helped me record my first podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it on zoom and he just recorded me
and I'm so grateful for him because he
[SPEAKER_04]: helped break the seal, you know,
like, or the way Sasha says, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he helped me turn over the rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once it's turned over, it's hard to,
hard to close it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like opening up the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't close it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing Maristem tissue culture at
home, you know, which I think is pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a lot of people doing
nodal tissue culture, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: as a hobby and as a home thing,
but he's actually doing Maristem tissue
[SPEAKER_04]: culture at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that he has a lot to offer
people on this network as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing I want to do is tell
Mark what we're trying to do is give you
[SPEAKER_04]: an opportunity to tell your story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't want the abridged version.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want you to, you know, tell us your
whole story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start, let's start from,
you know, how you were originally exposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis and, you know, move your way
through what you're doing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally was exposed to weed at around
the age of 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lived in Lower Box Town,
EPA, north of Philly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, I'd say a reasonably affluent
community and directly across the street,
[SPEAKER_01]: my best friend lived and it was housing
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got along with everybody and I would
hang out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play basketball.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where all my friends were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then, nobody really cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't as much as a stigma it
seemed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be across the street playing
basketball and my best friend lived there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he called me over one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: His brother-in-law was a weed dealer and
he had managed to snag a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: roaches from the ashtray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the very first time, the fifth husband
was a dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he lifted some right from the ashtray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember clear as day, we had a ball
field near the highway where we'd play
[SPEAKER_01]: baseball and there was a mulberry tree
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he rolled this big pregnant doober out
of all the roaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can remember just sitting under the
tree, like, Oh my God, my whole world just
[SPEAKER_01]: exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lasted forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember it lasted long enough that
I was wary of headed right home to let my
[SPEAKER_01]: parents see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was definitely not trying to get caught
then at the early age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sparked to the interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got the ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually a few years later,
after that happened, my family decided it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be better to move me from the city
into a more rural situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they bought a bunch of horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a farm, and that's where, where it
really ramped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having compost as a kid, you know,
it's the last place you want to have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: weed whacking and gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a huge manure pile and I always
took note of how big all the weeds got in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my family inadvertently hired deadheads
as farm hands, not knowing, see where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going with this, what a deadhead was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, I was in my glory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these guys, so long story short,
they were getting really high-end imports
[SPEAKER_01]: back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going back to 1982, 83 as a 13 year
old, I'm on this farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, I would buy 50, $50 ounces of
high-end imports that came from like
[SPEAKER_01]: Belize, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some ties back then and it
wasn't bricked the way we know it fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was compacted and it was just very
lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember getting the ounce, I'd pay them
and they'd hide it in the mailbox after
[SPEAKER_01]: the mail people already came.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my parents wouldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'd pay them, I'd walk down to the
mailbox, you know, at 12 o'clock and grab
[SPEAKER_01]: my ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this particular bag that would Belize,
I believe it came from Belize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already knew where I was going to put
it because I had a manure pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first seed that I grew was a,
a very young teenager and I got a pound
[SPEAKER_01]: off that one plant and it was better than
the weed that it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, man, that was off to the races.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your parents never found it in the compost
pile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a pound plant as a teenager,
not knowing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get away with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did your parents not find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew I was getting stoned by then and
my dad called and tolerated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found out later he might've been a
closet smoker and he hid it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That came out a little later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he, he let it rock out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there were times, believe me,
it's a teenager when I'd piss him off that
[SPEAKER_01]: he would get the weed whacker and just
stand there in slow motion and go from the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the bottom of the plant while
making eye contact with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, you know, high times he
came a thing and I started collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: those and that was when the first
knowledge of Amsterdam and genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that, you know, really came into my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think then after that, I started,
uh, I bought marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the marijuana growers Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I, I think I first started
growing with chemicals, not knowing any
[SPEAKER_01]: better because there wasn't a lot out
there on organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only things we had available in
the eighties, nineties were like rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: grow theater, 2020 miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my next advance was like,
maybe it's not a good idea to put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the manure pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dad may chop it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it moved to, um, digging big
holes, like I read about in some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: books and then putting the, I just put
straight compost in the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants would have new deficiencies
when they were done, but I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making butt yearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kept going then with, uh,
those commercial indoors and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them wouldn't finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously because they were equatorial,
but the ones that did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I kept doing that for a while
until after graduating high school,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1989, uh, the next year there had been a
local guy that was a legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a year ahead of me that had
already graduated that had the best weed
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was trying to stand office,
but I, I grew some balls one day and I
[SPEAKER_01]: went to his house unannounced and that's
where he ended me a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can still see it with these plants that
had really fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never looked like cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never thought or been exposed to
cannabis Indica other than the ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's when my first reading
started as a teen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, I think that may be my
grail Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the opposite of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never took notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I inquired about what he said,
I would think it was some Afghani I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten from Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew that out and was just blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that the, you know, grown was
great, but this stuff is narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had family bigger than my hand,
tight inner nodes, and it didn't mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ran that through, um, the end of the
eighties through the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I really, even though I read books,
I didn't have the real time breeding chop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember each success of cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I didn't do the best selection,
but it didn't resemble what I first
[SPEAKER_01]: started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of frustration in we're getting to
the mid nineties, once the punch was lost,
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized I needed to go to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saved money and it took a while as a
kid, you know, and young man then,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to get the money together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first year I went there was 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saved for my, my outdoor escapades,
you know, so that was the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And amazingly, I ended up meeting Neville
inadvertently, and this is a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was with my act recently,
recently deceased from cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, anyhow, we walked off the beaten
path off of dam square into a very small,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the name of it was the Emerald
triangle trading company where I met an
[SPEAKER_01]: American who owned the place and we had
mentioned Neville and he took over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, speak of the devil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I have an appointment with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to hang out and meet him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when he walked in in proper
business attire, leather, attach a case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bought super silver hayseeds for him
that he stuck out of the weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have an old VHS of the whole trip,
including parts of that Audi from the old
[SPEAKER_01]: cam corners that I need to get converted
converted to death, which I plan on plan
[SPEAKER_01]: on sharing that in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the, uh, the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana hat museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, before I met Eagle bill there,
I met Mila, the half queen where she
[SPEAKER_01]: showed us the pollinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the specs museum, the Van Gogh
museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it's on there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy stoned out white people from the U S
not knowing anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, can I ask you, can I ask you which
month in the year you were you there in,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the, in the winter time or in the
spring or the summertime?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I believe it was in the
winter and I can't remember, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: listed on the top of the cam quarter tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately I didn't get to see the
tulips out on full display along the
[SPEAKER_01]: single canal and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I learned not to bring, try to bring
tulips through customs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to join this was the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that first year, I believe I
bought most of the sensei seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had met Adam done there at TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we recently did a, um, an anniversary
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but from what I remember, I got Durbin
poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first year I got Hiva skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got early gunk from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got juicy fruit from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe a few others I forget because
that was a very long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can remember what I got from Adam
done because he had shared something he
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't sharing with the public as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, from CH feeds headquarters,
I got, um, Puna butter, which is no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: on the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, chocolate something or other chocolate
trip, maybe no longer on his menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I got the stage, which made a huge
impact on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll, we'll get into a little bit more of
that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, then I remember, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: MK ultra.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought back that first trip,
but then I remember thinking maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: best to ask Adam if he has something
that's not released to the public that he
[SPEAKER_01]: would come, come up off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Adam gave me Pollyanna, which I
believe was a Robert canal arc heirloom,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Kiva, which was the early building
block of early Pearl and, um, silver
[SPEAKER_01]: Pearl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I managed to get that from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, some of the others were Yumble
from Sager Matha, which it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's even in circulation
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he is bubble berry, which was
absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what else did I get from him that
really made an impression on me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Western winds, which was a Cali
myth knockoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was also amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get the sage or the sage and sour?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the shade.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't one that, that wasn't one that
he gave out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to call the sage and sour,
but I don't remember him releasing the
[SPEAKER_04]: sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sage was a regular release and then it
became Femini later in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed was definitely released to the
general public because the seeds I bought
[SPEAKER_01]: were in the THC packaging and I ended up
running a cut commercially that we kept
[SPEAKER_01]: around for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really did good in PA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eventually ended up, uh, naming my band
sage that made such an impact and we
[SPEAKER_01]: banded pretty well for good many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all dates back to that fateful trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, 99, I went back or no,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99 was first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back 2001 and that's when I started
noticing a discernible difference in the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC feedstock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, as Adam Dunn coined the term,
I got Dutch because I went to my tried and
[SPEAKER_01]: trues and that it makes sense that that
holdovers that were still good after the
[SPEAKER_01]: raids, but some of the stock took the hit
or hit early on because I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing the same Durban back from the
same vendor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the last time and all of it was,
Hey, it was like unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the last trip I took there,
but I think one of the things I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: delve into is pre 98 seems to be the,
the desired stock, but a lot of the duck
[SPEAKER_01]: vendors had leftover stock that extended
into the 2000 of those trains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people think after 2000,
um, it was undesirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all depends on if it was holdover or
not, because they had both that lasted
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, I think into 2001 and maybe even
beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when I first started noticing
their pack weren't good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, also others, not only since
it's, I will tell you now, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: there is other big, big producers that are
still on the scene from the Dutch scene
[SPEAKER_06]: and the same team, you know, maybe,
maybe Simon from Sirius stayed the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I, I met him a few times, but he,
he always kept his few strains,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he bought up the Magus genetics,
uh, when, when Magus was closed,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the only, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jarrett, the breeder, hi, that brings back
memories because his, his warlock was
[SPEAKER_01]: insanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that a shout out to my boy,
Johnny bones, a grateful head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, he's, he's got a warlock cut
banger and that magnetic Jared was the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I recall from memory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, I don't know the story
why, uh, the, the, the Magus genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: stopped working, but I know that Simon
took over the genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a double.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dutch, uh, cut in Austria circulating for
many years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's still alive, uh, circulating
still, uh, it was also, it's still a
[SPEAKER_06]: really, really strong plant, you know,
branchy stocky, uh, has particular,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, attributes, you know, that everybody
wants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, this genetics are still alive,
uh, in some little, you know, in,
[SPEAKER_06]: in little, even the early, you know,
before we recorded, you talk about the
[SPEAKER_06]: Swiss genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You, you remember the.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are the Lee and the, the,
the, all the, uh, all the seats,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, production and Felix mass
producing flowers in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I would never forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very little known part of Canada's
history over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, all, uh, his name was, uh,
uh, uh, Felix coats.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think he really was a, so,
you know, this real cannabis soldier,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, like, you know, some, sometimes
people say that the hippies that came,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the, the trail, the hippie trail
that was before the pioneers that got to
[SPEAKER_06]: the genetics from these far lands,
you know, that came to the West then,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, for us to, to enjoy,
like you said before, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you, you go to the land races,
let me say, and then it watered down in
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you went to Amsterdam in the
right time, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So please continue because it's really
interesting what you're telling me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we were dependent on the,
the train and after the Dutch bank fell
[SPEAKER_01]: off because I was lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them paid for mortgages for us
and, uh, where of cannabis, Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kansas, and the whole thing going on up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to high time magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the doc fell off and I, I blew a lot of
money on my last trip to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, um, I started using,
um, Mark Emory, heaven stairway,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, hemp depot, BCC company, um,
British Columbia seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was amazed and it wasn't like when
you sent seed to someone in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: where you'd wait a month, you don't get
any back then or wasn't tracking and you
[SPEAKER_01]: might get them, you would check the
mailbox and be like, maybe show up in two
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada was closer and it was quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we, I really panic and,
uh, I really wasn't doing a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated breeding there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some talks at home because the
genetics I knew would work and I needed
[SPEAKER_01]: them to keep, you know, keep the lights
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, then I started running,
um, off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Dutch tree times purple skunk from a
probably now defunct breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did really well for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I went sweet skunk from Cedar rates
and that's the other one I forgot did
[SPEAKER_01]: great for us in our climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and what else did I find from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the equal, um, BCC company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was white widow times NL
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember the name might've
been called white lightning or lightning
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna know for a while and kind
of the steam things started happening with
[SPEAKER_01]: those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them just went completely defunct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, this might've been circa 2002,
three or four, I think it started to fall
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when, um, on it mag,
I discovered, you know, readers that were
[SPEAKER_01]: local, like bog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Books.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like bubblegum my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems my life from then on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got his first feed going back to his
first drop and that was a game changer for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they keep her, they were domestic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get them shipped and it wouldn't
take a month before you got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd know you get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I kept running with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when, um, I really started
doing my first successful talks and then
[SPEAKER_01]: going back buying breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think not shortly after that,
if I recall from memory, it was also the
[SPEAKER_01]: old print yourself or on was up and that's
where I got some, um, I'm the guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, 88 G 13 half plant that was going
around on treating yourself for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I still have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to keep see of a skunk from that
first trip, which I'm about to F four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have those in seed stock early gunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have, which needs to have an
increase done in the super skunk pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just came into my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a whole nother topic
because I was going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody randomly who I had a few
communications with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That a nowhere said, you know,
I feel like these would do good in your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how that came to
fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have, have you, um, like what,
what, what are you getting off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you just put it into power,
but, um, like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it bring back any, any memories of
perhaps running it from, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: decades earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are spot on man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I have a family overactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird where I've been a smell from a
decade ago will register with me and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put that memory together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are spot on as I remember them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same leaf morphology and very uniform for
an F one cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they were when they made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got only eight seed and they're all
going, there were a total of five males
[SPEAKER_01]: and three females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, there's, there's, there's,
there's, there's, there's basically two
[SPEAKER_01]: main phenotypes I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one is probably the, uh,
the maple leaf Afghani T leaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to call that a totem
structure with minimal side breeches.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have non-hollow stems and that's
the other indicator that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think the stem rope that I'm
getting from them, the one phenotype is
[SPEAKER_01]: like T thinner turpentine or with an
almost self uric smell with skunk mix in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other phenotype is skunky red
Afghan type, but maybe the backend of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I'm very good at describing terpenes
to creamy sweetness almost defies
[SPEAKER_01]: description.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say maybe, maybe citrus,
but we're not talking anything fruity at
[SPEAKER_01]: all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking maybe grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's exactly how I remember
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the telltale shine will be the orange
pistils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was the signature trait that
when I grew them out outdoors from 90
[SPEAKER_01]: stock that they, they had, and they were
also bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember them getting rained on and
having no mold whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one thing that I remember about
the super skunk when we used to grow it is
[SPEAKER_04]: every single crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hold the sensei seed catalog up
against my flowers and it looked
[SPEAKER_04]: identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to this day, it's the only seeds that
I've ever purchased that looked exactly
[SPEAKER_04]: like the photo that they were advertised
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, the thing is that even
cultural practices could change the way
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers look, you know, like if I grow the
same flowers as you or as Nick,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to come out looking a little
bit different, but with the super skunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was unbelievable that it looked
identical to the catalog.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the most uniform strain I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way to balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's another interesting thing
we could get into later how the seed cut
[SPEAKER_01]: grown by three different people will
always look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even had things I've given to
somebody that was completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes my own cut, somebody was able to
maximize the genetic potential better than
[SPEAKER_01]: I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, damn dude, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I don't get mad about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take his brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something to be said about,
uh, the plant being an accumulator,
[SPEAKER_01]: sympathetic vibration from the person that
it's around and the energy that it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not some hippie bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it can be hippie bullshit
and be real at the same point,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just some plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or because like the, the phenotypic
difference I've always heard like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, you have to take environment
into account because like if, even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like a cultivar, let's say is like
the same cut, but then the phenotype is
[SPEAKER_00]: the production, you know, it's,
uh, it's the chemo type of like what is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually produced based on the
environmental factors and the grow factors
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, the interactions with the grower
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I think that it's super valid
and maybe there's, there's also just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of slight, um, miss terminology
sometimes in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just when it comes to how we've used
words in the past, when it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we could openly talk about
with those who are educated botanists or
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulturalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I think, I think you're spot
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's going to change no matter
where you're growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, but if something is super,
uh, similar across different growth
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and grow styles, that's
something that's, that's great because
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can actually have something for
someone in like a, you know, like in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia, uh, right, that they can have
like, oh, they want like the Cali cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, the Cali genetics or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have something that can grow
the same across different environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's how you can get that into
other people's hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think even, even going further,
how a plant will genetically acclimate to
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant, um, to the, to the outdoor
environment and become more resistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: things in your own environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's needs to be more studies done on
that that aren't just bro science,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some real, um, control group.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, my opinion about this is let's go a
little bit deeper, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: from, uh, from the start, you know,
cannabis behaves like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a survival plant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be, it has to survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also without the help of humans.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the phenotypic expressions in a gene
pool are basically because if it grows in
[SPEAKER_06]: an area where there is, for example,
the winter comes a little bit earlier,
[SPEAKER_06]: some years or the rainy season starts a
little bit earlier in the fall,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, some phenotypes will survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because of the cross pollination
between the, you know, let's say it's
[SPEAKER_06]: inbred line, it's inbred, not inbred,
but it's, it's again, wild cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it would put all these cogs now outside
somewhere without the help of humans,
[SPEAKER_06]: something would happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what would happen in one year?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some phenotypes would survive because
there was a dry season and they perform
[SPEAKER_06]: better in dry seasons, but they would be
pollinated by males that would also give
[SPEAKER_06]: them the genetics from others.
[SPEAKER_06]: So next year, when there would be a wet
season and the other phenotypes would
[SPEAKER_06]: survive, they will also carry the genetics
from the plants that would survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other seasons, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always in a gene pool because it
wants to survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the basis of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so hard or it's so, it wants to
survive in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, even, even going back to what we
had talked about last week too,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, so that's like over, over a period
of time within a genetic population like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, where they're picking up traits that
are advantageous to their survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the genetic drift that I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we use the genetic drift
differently in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, that within a population is the
genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a, it's a positive change,
like almost like a micro evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why some people get weird about
things with tissue culture, because some
[SPEAKER_01]: of them think it's unnatural and all,
but they don't realize the chimeric and
[SPEAKER_01]: truncated expressions can occur naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same things that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we get mutations in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been waiting to use chimeric in a
sentence, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you were able to slip that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truncation of mutations too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, so like what, what then happened
next on your, on your cannabis journey,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, um, it, it sounds like you,
like once you were out of Pennsylvania or
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, where, where were you,
where did you go to from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can back up for that part of the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it, I'm going to intertwine
what I did, what I did musically,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's all, it's all congruent with
the whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as this was happening and I got better
at breeding and I had a production cut
[SPEAKER_01]: that we, you know, we did really well
with, um, I walked into a head shop in
[SPEAKER_01]: Newhoe, Pennsylvania called the now and
then shop and the clerk behind the desk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I talked to him and I said,
uh, you know, I'm a guitar player.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have some good buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go smoke that sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how the band sage was started
in early 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my, in my township, I had supported
myself basically by, by cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-legal state, which is added trials and
tribulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we started the band and the band
started to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started to do music festivals on the
property because my parents had a farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was also for being honest, a good way
for me to clean money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that the band got bigger and the
population of the event exceeded the town
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So contractors could get attacked right
off if I put their name on our banner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it got big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also a way that kept me to
continue the other operation because
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody had any, any idea of knowing how
many people came in at the gate or how
[SPEAKER_01]: much money was being generated or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And incorporated into a blur and nobody
messed with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much had a symbiotic relationship
with the corn farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put thousands of plants in their
cornfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no overhead surveillance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would hand them a paycheck every
November and they were making more money
[SPEAKER_01]: off doing that with me than they were off
their milk or their feed corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like Johnny Appleseed in this very
rural community in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: So enter 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants do you think you had gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would plant double what I needed
because half would always get taken by
[SPEAKER_01]: hunters, by rippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I rate farm owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a game of cat and mouse with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been bitten by dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten cut by barbed wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it, it went on and on until 2005
and it was all local police though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have state police or overhead
surveillance, but 2005 state police came
[SPEAKER_01]: and unbeknownst to me, they had choppers
and they had FLIR infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2005 is the first year I got paid a
visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it scared me good, but because I
didn't really have any priors at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I got a slap on the wrist and me being
me, you know, somewhat anti-authority and
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it's my God given right to grow
weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't stop me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just moved to different locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go out of the County North or,
and, uh, I got to say it was a different
[SPEAKER_01]: era back then because it took a lot of
people to pull this off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a lot of people not to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would take me telling people to meet me
in the middle of a cornfield at midnight
[SPEAKER_01]: with a truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a trailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to do that unscathed till 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: By then, um, the band had started having
kids and we were no longer a band,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we felt that stay friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kept my weed hustle going
without the guys of the music festival
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long story short, 2015, I caught the
last lick and, uh, that was on multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: properties and they got me good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some seizure involved then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was the second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I caught, I caught a fed case in 2015
and, uh, I did over a year for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they gave me an ankle monitor,
but me being me, I devised a system where
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I couldn't go far enough to
maintain plants because they kept me to my
[SPEAKER_01]: driveway with the monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me being me, I got skid pallets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put casters on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I joined two together and I had a bamboo
poles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was, um, an eye hawk that
was that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through a pulley system, I could put
and pull the skid pallets that had buckets
[SPEAKER_01]: on them into heavy brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could pull them to me to
maintain them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I had to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never got caught, but I will tell
you the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just like pulling them in and out
of the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not the garage high, high broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my brush where the driveway ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could put them in, pull them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got, it got pretty bad at one point
because they could visit without any
[SPEAKER_01]: notification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember that year I had the horse
stalls where my meat or crop was,
[SPEAKER_01]: was drying to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it also happened that two very
large vultures made a nest in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the probation officer came to
visit, he wanted to check all the
[SPEAKER_01]: outbuildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let him check.
[SPEAKER_01]: All but the one, and it must have been a
blessing from God because I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you want to go in there,
but you can, but there are two very big
[SPEAKER_01]: vultures in there that are nest,
which there were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I couldn't have planned that
any better because as I said it,
[SPEAKER_01]: they flew from one flew from the roof and
he's like, yeah, we're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like splint and saw at the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty much carotid already.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing it and, uh, I got away with
it, but, um, it got too hot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while still on parole and probation for
this, I did the ballsy move.
[SPEAKER_01]: I contacted the probation officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, look, I'm going to sell the family
farm that they left it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'm going to, I'm going to head
out of here to Oklahoma where I can do
[SPEAKER_01]: what I can legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he said, yo, that shouldn't be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll run it past probation and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So famous last year was, uh, I've been
here four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2024 now going on probation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was, this was just five years ago
that you were growing illegally and the
[SPEAKER_04]: ankle monitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that story sounded like something
you were telling from a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, you know, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened then then got even
crazier because, um, I didn't anticipate
[SPEAKER_01]: it taking any length of time to,
to leave the transfer, the probate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, or any, any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is during the peak of COVID and
thank God that probation wasn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to visit then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I sold the property and had
everything in new halls and we're staying
[SPEAKER_01]: in a hotel and the probation says,
uh, well, have to go through what's called
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to transfer it to Oklahoma and
us not knowing that, uh, it was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trapped in a hotel for close.
[SPEAKER_01]: To four months at the peak of COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were terrified because nobody knew what
was going on then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a dog in tow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we burned through 30 grand,
just staying there, paying the hotel and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was nothing we could do about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was told if we contact Oklahoma to
see if they accept us to move there,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that they would violate my probation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the last hour, I risked it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found out who the director of
interstate compact was, and I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: call.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to get through and,
and move.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was shocked that Oklahoma let me get
a commercial license while still on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty, that's pretty
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more remarkable was the
outpouring of genetics from people that I
[SPEAKER_01]: did not even ask because in order to keep
my sanity, I kind of made a little blog on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram while we were stuck in the hotel
and everybody was caring for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get there because we were losing our
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, pardon my French.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were, we were losing our mind during
that, that procedure, not knowing,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if we could leave or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being, you know, rendered lost in
that hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a big outpouring from the
community, which I still can't thank
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone enough with all kinds of genetics
and love and well with his and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we finally made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you lose a lot of genetics in the
transition?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had to go through hospice with my
mother before we did the transition and
[SPEAKER_01]: move and sell the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he might've known I was in
trouble and meant well, but there was,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a vault that I had in the
Christopher band that he definitely threw
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the whole of the answer,
she was looking out for me, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking I shouldn't have them there and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there was, there was a lot in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's, what's the longest,
uh, like mother you've been able to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: around through all your different,
uh, travels and excursions and police
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, police interventions,
police interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably fell out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the DD four is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super old, but I was able to keep
that since getting it from, from IC mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one, um, the NDN guy G 13 hack
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've had around probably since,
um, early two thousands, those would be my
[SPEAKER_01]: oldest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some of them, people have copied them
for me that I trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't get them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to get some of those back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the community is for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a non-legal state, it really took
having someone you could trust to have
[SPEAKER_01]: backups for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I think prohibition,
a lot of the legacy cut for loss during
[SPEAKER_01]: then, because a friend means well,
and then you know what it's like when you
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes let your friends watch your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get, when you go away,
when you're still small scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: never ends good.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all had a horror story like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, those would be the oldest,
but some of them were, were older that had
[SPEAKER_01]: been held by people that have gotten back
to me and uh, I have a crap memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even remember off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I have a list of, uh, what clones
were introduced being the grateful heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them, yeah, one of them is,
um, the lavender cut, which came from 90
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma feedstock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited to get some of those to the
masses, uh, F zero gen cuts.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one thing I wanted to say is part of
the reason why I'm trying to get people to
[SPEAKER_04]: document their stories is because we're
all forgetting, you know, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: stories from 30 years ago are hard to,
you know, to tell people we didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: notes, you know, I mean, you have a VHS
tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like at the edge of my seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to see that, you know,
because, but, uh, yeah, the whole purpose
[SPEAKER_04]: of, of telling your story is so that it's
documented.
[SPEAKER_04]: For eternity, you know, and so I'm glad
I'm telling you a story.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty certain with today's technology
that can be converted to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should look into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to make that a priority
soon because tape loses quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not digital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even if I have to pay out to have
somebody do forensic retrieval,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's a stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we have that technology today at
worst, worst possible scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I mean, I know a little something
about this, you know, when the tape is
[SPEAKER_04]: damaged, there's no recovering it because
this is like, if you have a painting and
[SPEAKER_04]: you chip off some of the paint,
you know, like maybe somebody else could
[SPEAKER_04]: paint up, you know, so really you just
need to go do that right away is have that
[SPEAKER_04]: video digitized and that, you know,
once it's digitized, it lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you have actual tape up,
like, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you're a dead head in a fish
head, but like old cassette tapes after a
[SPEAKER_04]: while, they're no good anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and VHS is kind of the same thing for
the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a magnetic, you know, I'm,
I'm eight track old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had eight tracks too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that, you know, that's going to be
a priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be a real cool to share and get
that done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it'll validate some of this stuff
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And video format, you can only say so much
in words.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that way that's locked forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a frozen moment in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you had said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get out to Oklahoma in,
uh, 2020 and, uh, like what, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your first moves once you get to
Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a property?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, uh, you get your, you said you
get a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first, the first move was,
um, getting the license, which happened
[SPEAKER_01]: seamlessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was able to, so many already had a
license, helped me on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, um, OMMA really down everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had minimal visits from OMMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we weren't huge as a 30 by 20 shop
with, um, a 40 lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five acres of outdoor was what we first
started at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy did I get an education in a new
climate because I thought I had done my
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding on the humid East coast until I
came to a river bottom in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, if we're being completely honest
and I, people should share their failures
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first, uh, outdoor crop, I would say
was 80% loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm being honest and because there is
all different kinds of viroids and fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: here that I never encountered on the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we got set up right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think my first legal sale,
um, was Indiana, Indiana bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it was our first legal sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were really proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what did I do when I first got there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You would add ID compressed from the
trauma that happened, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew what was going on with COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were seeing people outside and,
and hazmat to testing, testing the septic
[SPEAKER_01]: for the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was a scary time because,
and I'm by no means politicizing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do, they get weird about COVID,
but that's not what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it added that fear factor and,
uh, there's nothing we could do about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was that anxiety because we were
told by Pennsylvania probation,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we contact to see the status of our
transferal, that they would violate me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm just now getting decompressed
over that trauma to be, if we're being
[SPEAKER_01]: honest, that took a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's so good to be out of the shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird for me because we know we
have sectors of weed was on a Polaroid and
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't share that shit with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everyone's like duckface selfie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at, yeah, here's the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was even when, when,
when legal, some paranoia from Pat,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, posting stuff, it was alien to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, man, the place that I live,
man, it's not the, it's still,
[SPEAKER_06]: like you said, nobody takes selfies with
those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was telling me plant the flower,
but you can't, uh, yeah, it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, um, the facility where I have my
library, yeah, it's in Austria and Austria
[SPEAKER_06]: has a law that, uh, is, uh, written like
this, you know, the Delta nine THC is the
[SPEAKER_06]: drug, which is forbidden, of course,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, it's the drug, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but cannabis is not a drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they, uh, have in law, they have
written down that the plant itself is not
[SPEAKER_06]: a drug until it not producing the
substance, you know, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after, and the action of cutting a bot
from the, from the plant is producing
[SPEAKER_06]: drugs, not growing it, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually, if you don't, uh,
if you would not have anything,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, no, no dry, uh, flowers at home and
they will have a police raid and you will
[SPEAKER_06]: have a flowering plant outside your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody would actually, I mean,
the judge would free you in the end,
[SPEAKER_06]: actually, because you are not producing
drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's aromatherapy, you would claim,
you know, it's very, very different,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the system works like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The government has taxes from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they, you can sell it as a producer,
as an ornamental plant, uh, cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: ornamental plants, which I, as a producer
sale to other shops too, and to many
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for example, I've been contacted by
Swiss, uh, pharmaceutical company just few
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks ago who have a license to produce a
high THC potent flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and also there is, uh, in Germany,
this kind of, uh, companies for years
[SPEAKER_06]: already, which I contacted me,
uh, but now in Germany is a legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can sell to a private grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, but still it is only opening
up right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you talk about something that
will be here in 10 years, maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, always the hurdles and
bureaucratic red tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time, time to free the weed
and anyone being persecuted for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a victim of crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's tragic and it still feels
like, and it sounds like it, it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition era for Austria.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so that sounds so convoluted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is like, uh, it is like a little bit of
taboo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody knows about it and nobody's
really giving a shit about it in that
[SPEAKER_06]: sense, like until you're caught.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they are, you know, like I,
as a producer, when somebody comes to me
[SPEAKER_06]: and buys five plants and he goes out of my
shop and I give him the bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means I, I sold you the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'm a, I'm a car seller.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to be 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have a license, a permit,
uh, for, for driving.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you'll buy this car.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you drive away, you make a,
you, uh, make an accident and who's now,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I mean, you're the one who is
responsible, not me, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just sold you the plants and on the bill
is written that you have to keep it on 18
[SPEAKER_06]: hour of lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that you see you keep it under
vegetation, that is not producing drugs,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that, that is so on the bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ornamental, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in essence, that's a waiver of
relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A waiver of relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lease of responsibility.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at least it's a glimmer of hope
headed in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, unfortunately, my only experience with
a gentleman that was an Austria look like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got all the bells and whistles for a
very large seed order.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the, uh, the, the expedited
delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was counterproductive
because it drew more attention and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: flagged in Austria and it didn't get
through, but it was never any,
[SPEAKER_01]: any official thing from them other than
they could do nothing for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was a huge order.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did in good faith was I took the
loss on it just to get them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a friend in Chicago who was
receiving the seeds and then however he
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting them to Austria ended up
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's reinforcing how tight it
is there because it was lifted as art
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies and they, they allowed us to have
another claim again.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to get it back and we haven't heard
anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping they got them there because
we were super pumped about getting some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of our strains to Austria.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, actually it's, uh, the system is
there and I think, uh, I already talked
[SPEAKER_06]: about it in the last podcast, how the
system here works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, it will be, uh, from year to
year, uh, easier to do it because,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, um, many, many other countries will,
will now decriminalize.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I say Germany legalized, it's wrong
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: They decriminalized it right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always with a jargon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's, it's just like, you know,
it's really still really, really strict,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but they can grow now at home,
which they couldn't before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's a really big
difference, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a ray of light anyway,
it's headed in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you can ship to Germany is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, it is crazy for me when Gabby
told me that you cannot ship between
[SPEAKER_06]: States, you know, in America, the clones,
that is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can ship cultures worldwide if
they're under a certain height,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's considered hemp considered
0.3.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's saying that if it doesn't flower,
it's, it has no rubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a loophole in the farm bill
here where if it doesn't contain THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so clones can be shipped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everywhere, everywhere through the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was telling you was, it was
something about a licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: nursery is not allowed to sell clones to
the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're only allowed to sell clones to a
cultivator or a distributor that then
[SPEAKER_04]: grows it or to a dispensary, which then
can sell to the public.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for example, the generation 00 clones
that you're producing, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, with, with the grateful head LCC
company, no, this will be certified.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, for my facility, I have a
passport.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I'm on the, under a watch of the
food and drug administration to do an
[SPEAKER_06]: import of that, because you already have
it from, from tissue culture, very
[SPEAKER_06]: systemic.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have, you have it from, it's a gen
zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit acclimatized as I think,
you know, uh, but it still needs care,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it can be shipped in one day,
you know, this can go through.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, this is also a signal to all
Europe now for, for this, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that generation zero is the next big
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also because we can trust,
uh, you know, Can you describe generation
[SPEAKER_00]: zero?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not claiming to be super well versed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know enough to be dangerous,
but, um, I think probably Sasha could
[SPEAKER_01]: describe exactly in proper context what
net zero is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't claim to be an expert in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tissue culture protocol.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's, I'm not an expert to maybe
cosmic would tell the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, if he's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I don't think he's, I mean,
basically Gen zero means it's the first
[SPEAKER_04]: generation has come out of the Mary Stem
culture culture has to be there for a long
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I heard some podcasts that the
Mary Stem should be, uh, like at least two
[SPEAKER_06]: years in Mary Stem, um, no Mary Stem,
no deal again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Stem, no deal in this form.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after these two years,
it should be introduced out because
[SPEAKER_06]: viruses or this kind of pathogens,
they cannot survive that that kind long
[SPEAKER_06]: time as a, as a parasitic, uh,
element in the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, uh, if you have it for two years
in the chamber and repeat the process and
[SPEAKER_06]: have it in, and then introducing it as
first time, you know, from Mary Stem to no
[SPEAKER_06]: deal from no deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: To, to routing and from routing to,
uh, to, uh, to a hardening phase where the
[SPEAKER_06]: Gen zero becomes the Gen zero clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It starts to grow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You acclimatize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, you need hoods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you need without hoods.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Gabby says you need, don't need
hoods, but it's like just the
[SPEAKER_06]: acclimatization.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you would do traditional mother plant
cuttings, you know, you start with the
[SPEAKER_06]: hoods and then you acclimatize it,
you know, and then you put it under the
[SPEAKER_06]: stronger lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from these plants, you know,
from generation zero plants, if somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: has a little lab, you know, can do,
uh, mother plants quick and make no deal
[SPEAKER_06]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have no deal already from those
kinds of plants and you, you still keep it
[SPEAKER_06]: in your library, you know, that is my,
the, the big thing, my, the idea that for
[SPEAKER_06]: me would be so interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would definitely buy this kind of
genetics in the future from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Home grower will make a mom and,
uh, we'll keep it, uh, really clean and,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, he will never get any diseases then,
you know, never let me say it's,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a good start.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's one of the, it's better
start than we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the, the other thing,
um, is I have a personal relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: My very best friend designed one of the
first modular TC lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That he's making available and he's
working out of the university of Tennessee
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's any synergy there that
that's going to be a worldwide operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, modular lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need his phone number, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's, we can, we can make this
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's my, he's my very best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He co-signed for the people he's working
with and he's working with two PhDs in the
[SPEAKER_01]: in their lab, um, at the university of
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got, they got some grant money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very gifted staff and
they're giving me a craft education in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I claim to have a rudimentary
knowledge of what it does, but I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing about the F0 clones to
mention is there will be restored vigor
[SPEAKER_01]: with the older cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will do away with a lot of the genetic
drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will do away with the full panel of
pathogens and byroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something really important
because HLVD, Fusarium, Moseo tobacco are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to run rampant in our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that being said, I think mother rooms
are going to be obsolete within five to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the thing that we're going to
start seeing next is cryogenic storage
[SPEAKER_01]: where we can store millions of plantlets
at scale in a very small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's going to eventually
make mother rooms obsolete because as we
[SPEAKER_00]: know, has your company been able to take,
um, like meristematic tissue culture or
[SPEAKER_00]: other tissue culture out of cryogenic
freeze?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the company that I'm working with,
Grateful Heads, I can't speak on because I
[SPEAKER_01]: just have a introductory, um, to the,
the, uh, their scientists who's doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the other company where my friend is
building labs for them has, they also can
[SPEAKER_01]: at haven't delve into another company
controversial topic, which is CRISPR
[SPEAKER_01]: editing, because there's another
misconception about that technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an advocate of it, nor am I
opposed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still discovery for me, but there's a
common misconception that it's GMO and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not, because if you understand the
simple concept of GMO, it's introducing a
[SPEAKER_01]: foreign entity to an already existing
cellular structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about CRISPR,
CRISPR is in essence that the giant pair
[SPEAKER_01]: of molecular scissors that's adding the
same organically plant material from
[SPEAKER_01]: within the plant source that it was
derived from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, they're doing stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I haven't done anything with my
cannabis genetics there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a, I'm a brand ambassador for their
CBD product, but any other lab services
[SPEAKER_01]: there are offered to me, you know,
so, and, uh, there's not really a conflict
[SPEAKER_01]: of interest because my genetics are going
to Grateful Heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a separate entity in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about Grateful Heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited to be on there, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be totally honest, a lot of the
guys that are on the board, not illegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like distant superheroes to me
that you'd see and be like, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like my cheeks are still getting,
they're getting flux just talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I'm blown away and honored to be
part of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Kevin Jodry, Skunk VA, Kraft Medical,
everyone on the staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's, uh, see the Kraft
medical did a great job picking the team
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's people that may not have a
lot of followers that don't get the
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure, but have a certain talent he
liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of hand picked a really good,
a good group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get together for Google zoom meets,
try to get together a couple of times a
[SPEAKER_01]: month and just get our heads together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I like the fact they're not all
high profile people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that means a lot because we're,
we're going to build each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on that platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and regarding my own genetic material,
um, I'm going to be introducing them
[SPEAKER_01]: probably January 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't believe I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain is over inundated with
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at your list this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw what I posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run through that without,
without getting off the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just the start of what I'm
going to incorporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a good bit of other things and it's
all so important to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the topic of Dutch genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, over the years and being in Amsterdam,
I was able to forge some friendships with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the breeders there, some old feed
stock from some people that are retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leads me into the next
conversation where I think, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: embryo rescue protocol will be,
will be a thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get some of these, um, you know,
long lost cultivars back, back to where
[SPEAKER_01]: they could be, um, job from home grown
fantasies retired recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gifted me all his remaining stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have the original mythy,
which is one of my all time favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, um, his key, which one,
one, the cannabis cup, the H the homegrown
[SPEAKER_01]: fantasies keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're super crystal and a few
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, oh, white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have those, I'm not sure of the
viability, but I think I'm going to save
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, um, from flying Dutchman,
I got a lot of their old, old remaining
[SPEAKER_01]: doc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes, I have a Roraburi of,
um, God, why can't I remember it now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot of gold, which I have as a mother,
no mother plant and seed line separate
[SPEAKER_01]: from the older stock, the real McCoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I'm most excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, a lot of people, the early
breeders use that same Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut for a lot of successful things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Selma was one of them off the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think Fancy may have used that
Hawaiian and they can, some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses that makes up the real McCoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to see what we can do,
because you got to remember if the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't pop, it doesn't mean that cell
embryo is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you can run them through
that, that, uh, protocol to reject,
[SPEAKER_01]: to regenerate them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some little primitive way would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Using gibberellic acid, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Dave gave, uh, Dave Pope,
AK bean brains gave me the recipe for
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but I've been afraid to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have the right PPM,
you know, in the water, you soak the seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you, uh, if it's too high, the PPM of,
of it, then I think there is one guy
[SPEAKER_06]: called Vader on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he has this, uh, uh, this seed
company.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like having a, you know, a YouTube
channel for years already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vader OG is his name of the channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's, uh, said it a few years ago
that, and he made an experiment also,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you have it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he has the right PPM.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has three cups with old seeds,
like 20 years old seeds and, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: first cup, second cup, third cup are with
different PPMs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the third cup was without a
gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also the lowest, uh, uh,
rate of, uh, sprouting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first two were sprouting really
good, actually 20 year old seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has gibberellic acid in form of
crystals, which he adds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it at home in the form of liquid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you can go, I don't know from the
head, you know, if I will say something
[SPEAKER_06]: now, it will be wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but I, it's Vader OG, uh, and,
uh, Vader, uh, he's named of the breeder
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I think ocean grown, uh, uh,
is his company ocean grown.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep that on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason it struck me that
great Dallas DALAS, I'm not sure if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly with him online.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing some home PC stuff like you are
and him being from Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you all might have some connectivity
connectivity if you're not following him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very informative about a lot of
things and he's the like us and the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that he's doing resurrection with old
seeds from, um, all duck vendors.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he's a friend of my very good
friend from Barcelona, the old school
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually he's one of the crew members
of old school genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, and he's really into Sativas,
you know, uh, I'm about to break in the
[SPEAKER_06]: verse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see him every year, you know,
in March, we go to Barcelona and all
[SPEAKER_06]: school has a boot where they sell karma
genetics, all school genetics and lucky
[SPEAKER_06]: dog seats, you know, uh, from skunk VA,
the gear, you know, that's where I get my
[SPEAKER_06]: gear from lucky VA from skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like grateful heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe I'm still working with
that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually the world is so small.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but the, the guy, uh,
great Dallas, like you told, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is a guy, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, he's really, really like into
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you meet these kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we are now on the podcast,
like who are so into it, but that's why
[SPEAKER_06]: Barcelona for me is like the only place
where I can go that I meet like minded
[SPEAKER_06]: people in person, because otherwise you
cannot meet in person.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can meet online online now like we do,
but you know, the world is so small,
[SPEAKER_06]: but actually we have points.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we can meet, you know, like,
yeah, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm, I'm, you know, the
camaraderie, the camaraderie, I feels
[SPEAKER_01]: what's needed again, instead of people
concerned with what everybody else is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you're honest and you grind
hard and you're consistent, everybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: their own lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: There shouldn't be a competitive vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talented, there's enough for
everybody to eat out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get so mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't engage in public drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even some high profile people you'll see
engaging in online drama about a trainer,
[SPEAKER_01]: about this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you're right, that's going to
be off putting to a potential friend or an
[SPEAKER_01]: end user.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just stay away from it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best thing is to be quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, you don't need the drama
for, and you don't have, you don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: the time in life for this drama because
you have so much work, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: With the plants, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there is so much work to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even now that we are on the postcards,
man, it is in the night now here,
[SPEAKER_06]: but actually we do in the day,
like your time now, I would have to go to
[SPEAKER_06]: the facility, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be like, guys, I still have five,
10 minutes, you know, I have to go,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, because you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like my babies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody of us feel like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all day, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one thing that struck me that I
think is helping our business model work
[SPEAKER_01]: out is a lot of these top readers,
you know, you may grow their stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: years and they're not really accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by all means, everybody operates
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means enough when everybody,
and it struck me, I'm never going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to answer my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to answer every single message I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's a redundant question from a
newb who's just starting out, that could
[SPEAKER_01]: be the most important question you're
asked all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you bet your ass if I can get back to
everybody, even if I'm ready to pull my
[SPEAKER_01]: hair out, I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think the, the human interactive
part is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think actually giving it enough to
take the time goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a successful business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much business 101.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to, I'm trying to do just that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I get a message on
Instagram or on YouTube, I try to respond
[SPEAKER_04]: to it, respond to it quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also do understand, you know,
like, um, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was talking to someone about
not so dog yesterday and they were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, you know, he used to answer my
messages and now he doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, you know, how many messages
this guy gets?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody, I mean, like he has,
he has, he has other responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like take it personal or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's just, you know, realizing me
after a while, it becomes overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for now, while I can do it,
I try to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to, and you know, what's great is
that's how I met Sasha, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's how I'm meeting other great
people, you know, and.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one, another great thing for me
of about this podcast is I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: making friends, you know, and,
you know, that's priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't emphasize the importance of that
enough because it's kind of lost out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone thinks they're competing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see people competing with
themselves and their own egos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really, and the way I perceive
life and I always have is there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: competition and competition is a mental
limitation because check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always somebody that's going to be
bigger, better and faster than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learn from the best and make it your
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the way I live my life
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to compete with yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want, you want to compete with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with your mind saying that you
can't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, with your mind saying that you
can't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My, my lady, she, you know, she works out
a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: She tries to go to the gym every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wearing gym rats for life,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this is my lady's gym and they
had like a competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, so I, I'm going to change
the subject for a minute just for some
[SPEAKER_04]: lighthearted stuff, but, um, so my lady
goes to the gym every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to go, I can't go as often and this
gym is kind of geared towards women.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, mostly women that go
there, but you know, guys are allowed and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, so I go there with them and they have
this competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's like an actual weightlifting
competition where they're doing all this
[SPEAKER_04]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, they asked you if I
want to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first answer is there's no way I
want to do it because these women practice
[SPEAKER_04]: gym are fucking bad asses.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all like, you know, like,
so like it would just be it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing is the only person
that I want to compete with is myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I, I just want to do better
and I want to lose some weight,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, may pack on a little bit of
muscle, um, but mostly lose my gut,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm competing with myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I go to the gym, I'm not looking at
like what the max weight that somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: else can bench presses or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm looking at is, you know,
how much more can I do this time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to push myself to be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why I said, like,
I like competing with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, real, real quick on that topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I being sedentary and being on
probation and not having a license because
[SPEAKER_01]: they take their license.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I moved to Oklahoma, I'd always say,
lean, you know, and just from being over
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, dude, dude, I went,
I walked around at one 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm six foot four and three years later in
Oklahoma, I got up to a 254 like much
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, this year I lost it all and I got
muscular again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think it was possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: My blood pressure went up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what made me do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I dropped 54 pounds and the main thing
that made the weight shed off and lose my
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a four pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to show anybody that's a
tacky, but anyway, I'm doing it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it now, which is the reason I'm
bringing it up is, uh, I fast every
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to bed, you know, very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to bed at eight o'clock every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm up at four with the plant and,
uh, every Monday I fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't eat until seven o'clock on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's you know, over 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, then my meal is usually something
very light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fruit or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to get into it,
it's super hard because you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get irritable when you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might even have cramps or anything,
but we consume as humans far more calories
[SPEAKER_01]: than we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really didn't figure it out until I
got into fasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll, we'll end on that note.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I applaud you for your health journey
because our trip is short.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're, you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you know, uh, the older you get,
the more you feel the body needs something
[SPEAKER_06]: else.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, the, the culture here in
my country is we eat quite a lot of meat,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, also a lot of vegetables because
we grow our own food.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quality of that food is quite high,
you know, but in the last, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 years, of course, there is a lot of
supermarkets and you know, the food gets
[SPEAKER_06]: lower quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people lost it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is also cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now people lost the feeling that you
need to buy from a farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, somebody that is locally here,
the food is not being dry driven from far
[SPEAKER_06]: places to your table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the best thing is if you have all
the food, if you can from your local
[SPEAKER_06]: environment, which is like a radius of a
hundred kilometers, you know, that is
[SPEAKER_06]: great because it means people,
people who do that, you know, also we,
[SPEAKER_06]: we, people, I say cannabis people,
when we do our end product, the thing that
[SPEAKER_06]: is for us still here, illegal to do,
but when I do my clones, I want to be them
[SPEAKER_06]: the a quality, a, a, a quality,
you know, as I can do it, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not send them to Germany,
to a home grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is no, not really the best clone
I can send to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I rather, you know, if I have older
clones, that is, you know, not the higher
[SPEAKER_06]: score, I rather say, Hey, I wait for the
next round of the cut, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: just to have the best quality,
you know, because the word spreads around.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you, if you are spreading your company
will rise.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you advertise through your product,
product, not through advertisement,
[SPEAKER_06]: naked woman, or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that is not the way you should
advertise wheat, you know, because wannabe
[SPEAKER_06]: speak, wannabe people like the truth,
you know, we like the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so much truth to that and
presentations, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you care about yourself and you run
a clean show, that'll be felt and
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciated by the end users.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something else I can add to that
is I remember when I opened up,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the garden spout, like my gross shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within days of opening up my store,
we got a visit from the only other place
[SPEAKER_04]: in town that you could buy any.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gross stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I opened up the first indoor grow shop,
but there was a store and it still exists
[SPEAKER_04]: called spare time supply and spare time
supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: They saw sold soil and pots and
fertilizer, all kinds of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in a ocean container in the back,
it had grow lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like a regular nursery,
but it was in Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the clients there wanted to buy stuff
to grow weed in, but they try to keep it
[SPEAKER_04]: like low key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I opened up my store and my store was
based for the indoor grower, I had grow
[SPEAKER_04]: lights in the window, shining up the
highway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you couldn't drive through Willets
without seeing high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_04]: lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I quickly got a visit from the son of
the store owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at first I didn't know who he was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just asking me some questions and
I'm a little excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my store open and he says,
well, my name is Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from spare time supply and we're going
to put you out of business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and slight merge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He felt very threatened by it,
but you know, he didn't put me out of
[SPEAKER_04]: business and they had a wholesale company
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: They started selling me stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like selling me the soil because I
could buy it from someone else,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they were local and it was easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just pick it up instead of having
pallets of soil delivered.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think eventually they
realized, yeah, you know, he's taking some
[SPEAKER_04]: of our business, but he's also bringing me
some business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, what they realized is they
had to step up their game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if they wanted to market to the
indoor growers, they had to take the shit
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the ocean container in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did, you know, at that point they
had the grow lights right up front and
[SPEAKER_04]: center and they even grew some plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, like, I feel like I had a positive
influence even on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then other stores started to pop up
and honestly, a few of them were like my
[SPEAKER_04]: former clients.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two bigger stores that opened up,
these guys used to be my clients.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I remembered the spare time
thing, them coming to my store and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and threatening me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, when they told me they were
doing it, I was like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: congratulations, you know, like,
like let's go into this as friendly
[SPEAKER_04]: competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's both try to make each other do a
better job.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want the bad type of competition
where the customer can work us against
[SPEAKER_04]: each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so like he would call me up and
say, Hey, this guy says you're selling
[SPEAKER_04]: them the lights for 400 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd say, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'd say, okay, I'm just going to
match the price.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we wouldn't beat the other guy's
price.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd match the price.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you want to shop with me,
because you appreciate the service that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing, then you shop with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to shop with him, you can shop
with him, but it's not going to be about
[SPEAKER_04]: price.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, but the whole idea,
I think what I was trying to get at is
[SPEAKER_04]: when we were talking about competition.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Competition can make you elevate your game
and not be lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can be a good thing if you're not lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to say that there can be bad
competition too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually what happened here was there
was some big corporate owned grow shops
[SPEAKER_04]: that owned like tons of grow shops
throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they did was they started
targeting areas and they sold products.
[SPEAKER_04]: For like cheaper than I could get it for,
certainly cheaper than what I could sell
[SPEAKER_04]: it for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they put basically all the
independently owned grow shops out of
[SPEAKER_04]: business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I want to say is there's good
competition and there's bad competition,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, but overall you should always
try to make the competition make you
[SPEAKER_04]: elevate your game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good you had a healthy
camaraderie amidst the competitive nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good that you turned it around,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I love about the Grateful Head
project, you know, that so many great
[SPEAKER_06]: heads came together.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the game changer now
globally, because you have to understand
[SPEAKER_06]: not only for you, this is a new thing
because you are a part of the Vietnam,
[SPEAKER_06]: but in Europe and all around the world,
people know about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like in South Africa is a legal
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Uruguay is a legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: In, you know, many parts of the world
already there is legal market and they
[SPEAKER_06]: will want to have these genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for somebody to have like a true
cut of Chem D, you know, from Europe or
[SPEAKER_06]: South Africa, this is like, whoa,
you know, this is for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I don't know anybody that would have
a true Chem D cut, you know, we have Chem
[SPEAKER_06]: D hybrids, you know, you have,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause as you said, Soma's Lavender,
I can tell you the backstory on those that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from a gentleman in Yuba City,
California, who got 90 Soma stock and he
[SPEAKER_01]: did a Fino hunt and he selected that cut
from the best 23 females that he got from
[SPEAKER_01]: that stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I know about the backstory
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you a little bit about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lavender cut has Laurel lavender turps
with a back, a backend that's not unlike
[SPEAKER_01]: real opium, if you've ever experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first, the first initial hit to the
pallet would be like Lavender
[SPEAKER_01]: aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that gives way to something a
little more complex, which is a spice,
[SPEAKER_01]: not unlike opium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plant is finished in no later
than 53 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown two, three foot long Louisville
sluggers in really bad season without a
[SPEAKER_01]: speck of mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now crosses like a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: The branches on it, it's a very tight to
itself plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a neat topping, but the branches
on it are like lumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prehistoric fans, very tight internodal
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more potent than the named purple
cut that I've encountered, which would be
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother of Berry, Granddaddy Purple,
Purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them are slouches in the potency
department, but I think there's higher
[SPEAKER_01]: linalool count in my Lavender cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and the outcrosses are my wife and
I's go-to for anxiety and for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to be too graphic, but I've heard
reports that it's good for women's monthly
[SPEAKER_01]: woes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds a lot like the Lavender that
Mad Farmer uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have a lot of respect for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked along the same lines,
but it's definitely not the same cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: different sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mad Family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're in Oklahoma now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how bad my memory is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one, I have Pot of Gold Mother
from Speed Pop of Old Stock, which would
[SPEAKER_01]: make it an F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a 90 stock clone that
somebody was kind enough to gift to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two different things there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when my memory doesn't serve me,
how about you Adlib?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go down the ones I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pot of Gold is from 90 stock Flying
Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Gunk 1 times Hindu Cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That finishes in about 63 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes a dense golf ball type
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Terps, I would describe as a skunk
family and an apple orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got very mentholated notes to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like the first toke off a bowl
is almost like a thin mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say cookies, but it has
that that mentholated mouth feel to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you exhale, it's like burnt
rubber intermingling with skunk with the
[SPEAKER_01]: back note of apple on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the best way I can describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny, I bet a lot of these other
COAs would not test very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as potency, you know,
three potency, I put the pipe down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's definitely comparable to some
of these high THC testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The GD4 cut came from an IC mag thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came directly from Josie.
[SPEAKER_01]: May he rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure we were on the fence
introducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Steve, you see this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spoke out of line, my apologies,
because we're still figuring out exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know most of that list is going to
be available soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sugar pot came from my favorite Sour
Cut in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pot came from MrBobML.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cookies in that lineage,
I'm not a huge cookies fan, but I like
[SPEAKER_01]: them in out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of validate them by hitting
them with old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few exceptions I make for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing against them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some goodness there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a taffy for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at it as kind of like a blank
canvas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sugar pot that's on there is
MrBobML Sour Cut times Bag Seed Mail that
[SPEAKER_01]: was found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an official cookies drop a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great plant because it's got
the gas sour turps with the fresh bakery
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It yields heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Checked all the boxers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lancet, I was looking at your list of your
strains, not the Grateful Head one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a question about the Grateful
Heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am ignorant, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this like a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're providing genetics and are
planning on doing it globally?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually a little bit not informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have done the intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Grateful Head is a collective of
breeders and geneticists who have access
[SPEAKER_01]: to a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are offering F-ZeroGen clones on a
global platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve at Kraft Medical is the CEO,
along with Kevin Jowdry is the majority
[SPEAKER_01]: shareholder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Blooms and Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the minority shareholders are
breeders and geneticists, such as myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maths Made on IG, Fire in the Hole
Genetics, All-Star Clone from Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 16 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So God help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely can't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be a global library.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real library for global repository.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main point about them is
provenance, pain of custody is asked by
the geneticists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're wanting to get the real Chem
91 or the real Lavender, they don't play
[SPEAKER_01]: around, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any genetic material that's introduced,
we have to go through a very, very
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorous background to the nth degree
before it's even contemplated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exciting for me to worry about
getting one or a hybrid of something that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you know that you're getting that
through us, you know you're getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: real Chem 91 from the man himself or the
real Chem 91 D or the real pot of gold,
[SPEAKER_01]: the real Lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exciting to me because nothing
against anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see so many knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see fake cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't even comment anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is this already available to the
community or is this something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming available?
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding my genetic material,
I will be introducing it to the lab and
[SPEAKER_01]: for testing January 15th or before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometime however long the TC protocol
takes, mine will be introduced,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we already have live drops going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could find out more about that on
the Grateful Heads or Dutch Blooms page
[SPEAKER_01]: where I think there's a sticky thread with
everybody mentioned on there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you still have a cultivation
facility of your own in Oklahoma or have
[SPEAKER_00]: you like kind of dedicated that space to
these other projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved and downsized a little bit only
because I didn't need acreage and our
[SPEAKER_01]: business model is only set up for my wife
and I, which shout out to my lovely wife
[SPEAKER_01]: because my mother room on Sleek and she is
my queen of logistics without her,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd probably be messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank God for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: We downsized a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a half an acre for outdoor,
which is all I need for my purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a 30 by 20, 40 lighter here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest of my home and garage is
set up as a drawing room and testing area
[SPEAKER_01]: where we keep the mother room and where I
test everything before I let it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think because of the way things are
headed that commercial flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm focusing on seed increases and
maintaining my mother's stock and testing
[SPEAKER_01]: my new drops because there needs to be
more transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from in general with testing,
so I like to post the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to post the testing, the good,
the bad, and the ugly and get it out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get what I would think is a product
I can put my name on pretty much for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you using that 40 lighter to do all
the, you know, the phenol hunting and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm using my home, which has
ample enough setup, but I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to justify not having a commercial
license firing that up with the overhead
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least not, not for now, but that's
always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do things backwards from a lot of
breeders because my thing is who wants a
[SPEAKER_01]: great plant that does great indoors
commercially produce it for somebody,
[SPEAKER_01]: but falls apart when it's outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have no plant count here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my testing outside first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make my selections based on the most
vigorous plants that don't show Sephora
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew or botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I bring them inside and test them,
which is probably the opposite of what a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people do, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't Oklahoma Hurricane Alley or Tornado
Alley?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's shifted in the past three years if
you follow any of that and we're not in
[SPEAKER_01]: the area that's dry barren and dusty that
gets that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually in a groovy little place
that's zone 7B and we're in the foothills
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Ozarks in Southeast Oklahoma near
the Arkansas border.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a great outdoor growing climate
that I can't even believe that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce the quality of the outdoor flower
because it never rains here in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry, so we get a lot of the outdoor
that looks like indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just full time, full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full sun, and that does require vigilant
IPM, but like I said, it took a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: learning curve to get the climate down and
to know what works and what doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy to say that we might have
had maximum of the outdoor harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: less than 8% loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it doesn't rain here, you're still
going to get botrytis with certain
[SPEAKER_01]: super-thick clonobars, and especially if
you get budworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even without rain, that'll cause mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very few little bits were from the
budworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big battle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get immune to Baxillus thurgensus
here, so I alternate with other things
[SPEAKER_01]: like Dappel that are all safe organic from
the same company and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes that and getting underneath the
plants, looking under, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: time-consuming, but it's what it takes to
make good flower here in this state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny, some of the cultivars I've
had COAs done from indoor of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: screen and outdoor, it's always higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I'm a huge advocate of judging
weed on CHC content, but terpene content
[SPEAKER_01]: and CHC always seem higher with sun-growns
than the COAs from the same screen run
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, full spectrum, we always say this
term, but it's the absolute light.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the planet sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the planet, it's a sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the other planets are around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are circulating around the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, this is it, the base of
life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every plant you see, you know,
you've been growing up enough in a
[SPEAKER_06]: countryside, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because you talk about the farm
as you were a kid, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you know plants from beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something you observe,
they are around you all your life in the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really realize this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really, because you are
interested in other stuff first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then actually it comes behind you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you catch the flow,
you do it because with weed, actually what
[SPEAKER_06]: you told the story is very similar to mine
also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like not the other drama you told,
but because I live in another place,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, from the perspective,
how you look to the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now from breeding perspective would
be, I think that after I read the Mendel,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mendel, you know, from the 19th century,
Mendel, you know, the first and the second
[SPEAKER_06]: and the third rule of Mendel, you know,
he actually did it on tulps and fish and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, he breed with other stuff,
not cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But he actually was like a guy that could
see the coat in the living organisms,
[SPEAKER_06]: how it behaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: The F1 generation from through two very
far away parents will be a very good
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from that hybrid, if you go to F2
in the filial line, you will have like the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole picture of colors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now choose one color that you like,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and go that way because then in
the F3, you will end up with more of that
[SPEAKER_06]: color.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is with tomatoes and any other
vegetables, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick on that F2, that is where a lot
of the gems are to be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a prime example, as you're going
through line breeding is there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: jewels that can be unlocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at it kind of like opening up the
final phase in the video game.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I have super lemon haze times
day five tie, and I'm running through the
[SPEAKER_01]: F2s to make my increase which I'm going to
have soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found a recessive trait broadly that
looked like none of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it smelled like lemon gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mind was so blown and I thank God I
cloned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up pollinating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's so far away from the goal
target of what I want with my release,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is jagged Salkus serratum tie
looking plant that I'm not releasing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm keeping that clone for R&D So my
point being is a lot of end users like
[SPEAKER_01]: feed by or sky away from the F2s,
I think there's always the potential to
[SPEAKER_01]: unlock a recessive trait that you might
not see through the F6 generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would by turn be a pure breeding
line or an IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little breeding with a grape ape
sensi star mother or a grape ape sensi
[SPEAKER_00]: star father and a runt's mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I got that to the F2
generation, I was getting these two major
[SPEAKER_00]: different like structural phenotypes of
like one being super short and squat like
[SPEAKER_00]: the grape ape and then one being really
tall and stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tall and stretchy one,
I found one where it was just like all
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was really pleasant to find
that because all the small ones were very
[SPEAKER_00]: grapey, but then all the tall ones had
that sort of spicy earthy earthiness of
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of some of the older purples and
a little bit of what I remember sensi star
[SPEAKER_00]: being.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you cloned or did you clone the
unusual?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved and I lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still have probably like a couple
thousand of the F2 seeds so I can hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: through those one over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everybody has the one that got away
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year, because there are so many
times when I've grown it out and was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I can't re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't I clone that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, this year I got two that I think
I'm really, really, really happy that I
[SPEAKER_01]: saved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one was a volunteer that came out of
my compost pile and it reeked and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to backtrack to what soil I put
in the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Ron to get a rough assimilation of
what the parents were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I ran lemon, lemon tree and
gorilla glue for and the plant that came
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it back on my Instagram feed
is louder than the lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so resinous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very skimpy producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I started it late outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm running that indoors for R&D,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people, if you get an inkling and you
have a plant, even if it's an early veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can house it, trust your gut
instinct because a lot of y'all are
[SPEAKER_01]: watching this have been around plants long
enough that you can learn to trust your
[SPEAKER_01]: gut instinct, even when the plants that
it's forced know that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying is don't have regrets
like all of us have and clone it if you
[SPEAKER_01]: think you're on the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't throw the runs away either,
because those always end up being the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: OGKV has entered the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the the weirdest, you know,
curliest leaf looking motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just not growing like
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turns out to be just like the
best smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'm the worst at culling everything
when I see people a lot of times be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we had all these beauty and I got
rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like I'm crying on the inside
because some of some of those mutants are
[SPEAKER_01]: worth the wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they'll grow out of their stunted
trait or whatever is wrong with them and
[SPEAKER_01]: develop into amazing plants, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking, like, you know,
like keep them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, even like Mac one, you know,
like, well, it is just terrible because it
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes forever to get a good clone
mother off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like being overgrown by
anything else that's around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always hate pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought I was able to get some
seeds off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some friends with that and military
chocolate dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to run those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them sitting somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the caps frozen lemons,
which is similar to that, like it grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's so you talk about the
back one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is another capulator strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grows so slow in veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a really long time till,
you know, it becomes a plant with decent
[SPEAKER_04]: enough structure that you want to flower
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's cool about it is that then when
you flower it, it doesn't really stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like for indoor cultivators
or multi tier gardens, it's nice to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to have a plant that doesn't want to
have a big stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's it's super unique weed as a like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jackie Terp profile, not exactly Jack,
more like citrus than Jack, but to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a sativa that grows very much like an
indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so like nowadays when people are
wanting to grow sativas, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a plant that takes 14 or 16
weeks to flower, you know, and gets 10
[SPEAKER_04]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the caps, frozen lemons,
it's Capilator put out some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the caps, frozen lemons,
I prefer to the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big fan of the Terp profile of
the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the caps, frozen lemons, I think is,
is really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I respect caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember him, I remember him on THC
Farmer posting back in the day before his
[SPEAKER_01]: fit blew off.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a testament because a
lot of people out there and probably any
[SPEAKER_01]: walk of life or trade, if you keep doing
what you're doing and really have passion
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, you push forward and you accept the
failures, eventually something good is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen like us sitting here
talking together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I would have gave up, I wouldn't even
be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, never even expected to
be mildly successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying we're taking over the
world, but it's really built.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that comes with taking the
lumps and just never stopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes to like beginner people that
are starting out, beginning hobbyists,
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, end growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to mess up, share the mistake
and you just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you never stop and you're around
for long enough, people are going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: tired of seeing you and you're going to be
successful, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I think, you know, all the
breeders, the small scale or even the big
[SPEAKER_06]: scale, for example, I will tell about
Shanti again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shanti Baba is one of those guys that
still communicating with his, not only
[SPEAKER_06]: customers, you don't need to be a customer
to ask him something, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: on his forum, but he's communicating with
you on his forum, on the Mr. Nice Seats
[SPEAKER_06]: forum.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has a forum and Capolator does the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has some basement, green basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this, you know, these guys really
are true breeders, true caregivers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can talk to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, SkunkVA has this, how is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Reddit, no Reddit, it's Discord
and Duke Diamond has the Discord and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can reach those guys if you want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can always say accessibility.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you know that these guys actually
really care for what they do because they
[SPEAKER_06]: are accessible.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, you know, it's not like always.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't fake the funk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't fake the funk, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, many others they are, you know,
maybe DJ Short was a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_06]: also accessible, not in that way because,
but today he's a little older,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I respect his work so much also,
you know, from a European perspective,
[SPEAKER_06]: because he's so odd.
[SPEAKER_06]: His genetics are not Dutch, you know,
he took his own genetics and bred them
[SPEAKER_06]: together and still has this, you know,
I don't know much about him rather than
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been waiting from the nineties to
know who this guy is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in 2000 something, a YouTube
video appeared with an interview with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, wow, man, this is a
professor, you know, like, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: around long enough to know that the Dutch
banks that got his blueberry never paid
[SPEAKER_01]: him properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: They never paid him properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is like they took his work and they
never let him even select with them,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and then they advertised it in
the beginning as it, we were working with
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after that, they put his name out
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just read about blue lines,
you know, uh, we will not talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: people can Google it, who it is and
everything, but I'm actually, every time I
[SPEAKER_06]: see this, you know, that people fuck
somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like so directly like that, you know,
I will always cherish the real one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, now that we're on that topic,
I'm not going to get into the who,
[SPEAKER_01]: the how, but, um, people out there,
if you're a budding breeder or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be really, really careful,
careful of who you trust things with
[SPEAKER_01]: because, uh, we're not going to delve on
it, but I think there are some validity to
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, recently a friend did a gain trust
that asked me to acquire some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some genetics that were very rare and dear
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was pre 98 Cali myth, Neville Taze,
and, uh, original Hayes, non AG stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: was sourced in Amsterdam by my friend to
tree farm, who used to own the gray area,
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out the two trees on IG and he got
them for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I reluctantly told the friend,
the terms he had wanted some Hayes
[SPEAKER_01]: kinetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, look, uh, I know you're
threatened out then and I doubled down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that you, you can do
the increase and do the selections for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very recently, uh, this happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the day before Thanksgiving,
six months later, I didn't see a picture
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No update, no selection done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy just got really nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said they're dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: F you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people be careful, get everything in
writing, document anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's larger scale, get a lawyer to draw
up some contents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't like necessarily the plant
patenting thing, but it's still someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property that meant something
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just be really, really wary of people
because a lot of people have this hippie
[SPEAKER_01]: moniker that they adapt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they use that as, as a math to
gain trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's all I'm going to delve
on that topic today is just to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, be careful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first nature to trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people see that as, as a weakness
and, uh, there's a lesson learned in that
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalists are going to capitalize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say something to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you reminded me of an old story that
isn't just cannabis or it's not about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis at all, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so first of all, you have to be
careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what happens to a lot of people is
they get burned and then they don't trust
[SPEAKER_04]: people at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should be careful, but don't give
up on the human race and don't give up on
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my story, and I'll, I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell it quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to go eat at this Chinese
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a couple of times a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was when I lived in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived in Casadero and the restaurant was
in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like from near there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like 40, 40 minutes away from
where I live.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day, um, and this was like three
cell phones, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I left home and I left without my
wallet, but I eat at this restaurant all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I show up to the restaurant and I
tell the guy, it's like, Hey, you know
[SPEAKER_04]: what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I ordered food to go, but I left my wallet
at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, can I pay you tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, why?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, because I've been burned too
many times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I asked him, I said, what are you
going to do with this food?
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I'm going to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking to myself, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told him, I said, I feel so bad for
you that you've lost trust in humanity to
[SPEAKER_04]: the point where you would rather throw it
away than trust that someone is going to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, come back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pay for the food, you know,
and what I want to say is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe you gotta be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, but, and it sucks that
you got burned.
[SPEAKER_04]: You told me a little bit of the story
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been burned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have a situation where I've been
burned by the same person twice,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, because I wanted to believe that
they would do better because I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe I believe in people too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you got to find the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a fine line between being cautious
and being cynical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not the type of person to be wired
to be cynical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very outgoing and I love people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just basically never
gambling what you can't afford to lose
[SPEAKER_01]: while still being open to having trusting
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't make some gambles,
you ain't going to get the big reward too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to gamble with a small
percentage of what, of what your net
[SPEAKER_04]: worth, whether it's in cannabis or,
or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like friendship requires trust and
trust requires vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta, you gotta like open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much truth to what he just said
too, because I've gotten to where I am
[SPEAKER_01]: today, which I'm not quite sure where that
is other than Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: By not being, by not being afraid to be
rejected, like some of the higher profile
[SPEAKER_01]: people, higher status people, whether it
be in music or theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or movies, you're never going to land the
Hail Mary that you don't throw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've ended up in some places that I
didn't think I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's from being able to accept
rejection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like a really weak
analogy and by no means misogynistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a guy hits on 10 beautiful girls,
one of them is going to go out with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to gamble sometimes in life
because you're never going to land that
[SPEAKER_01]: Hail Mary if you don't throw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Validate what you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Nick to repeat what he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I feel like we were talking over him
and it was, it was a nugget.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked over him.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, it was off the cuff and I've
been smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to get it out of me
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to look back through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of smoking, I'm going to yell to
my, uh, my beautiful wife to bring me a
[SPEAKER_01]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's not near me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I remember what I had said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a friendship trust and trust
requires vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to open up to be vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and Sasha, uh, call, uh, you know,
my, uh, what I can add to it now is like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been traveling a lot, which I told in
the last two podcasts a little bit about
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you then, when you travel through
different countries, different cultures,
[SPEAKER_06]: really, really far away from your,
your, uh, home, you know, where you used
[SPEAKER_06]: to be in your culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then normally it's also, you have to
accept the, the, the difference,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it's really also, uh,
and then you develop a sense of somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: that you look in the eye directly and can
sense if he wants something bad or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've been traveling through all of
Asia almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, in the night in Jakarta, for example,
which is a place like you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, it's actually not dangerous if
you know how to behave, you know what I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, uh, of course, if you're
stupid, you're going to go in,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, different places of the world,
you're going to go in the wrong street.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, in Amsterdam, we've been
attacked one day, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: by, by some guys, but, uh, my friend who
was with me is also from the Balkan area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said the swear word in Serbian to
them and they leave, they leave.
[SPEAKER_06]: They let us in the moment and they went
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and we were asking in Amsterdam at
that time, why, you know, why was it like
[SPEAKER_06]: that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he was swearing, you know,
in Serbian.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said to us, yeah, because Serbian
mafia is having the place now,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, in this time, I don't know who
is having it now, you know, at that time,
[SPEAKER_06]: but at those times also the Balkan mafia
was there, you know, I mean, people on the
[SPEAKER_06]: street, the bad guys, you know,
uh, you can avoid them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have the field, you don't need to
encounter them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You, you, you, you avoid them all the
time, you know, even in conversation,
[SPEAKER_06]: you, you are a short and you always,
when they invite you somewhere,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't go and, you know, you have to
sense it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit of a, of a third
feeling, you know, in the gut.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's how we survive,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like that, you know,
I've been burned too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one day I will talk about it in a
podcast, but really, really in the
[SPEAKER_06]: business, you know, you get burned and you
have to accept it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you go on, you have to learn
something from it and you go on,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go on, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I want to say something,
um, first of all, Nick, that's such a,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, what a proper thing to say that
friendship is, you know, being,
[SPEAKER_04]: being able to be vulnerable and open with
somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's why, um, Sasha and I have
become friends is because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: over the last few weeks, we've been
talking to each other and we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to be vulnerable and tell each
other things like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when we realized that we're so
much alike that if we don't, if we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to be vulnerable, we don't get an
opportunity to have these moments and make
[SPEAKER_04]: these friendships.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, it's like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just like one of those plastic
girls that are really fake, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't, you know, like fine,
they're pretty, but you have no idea who
[SPEAKER_04]: they really are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably don't know who they are
either, but, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, that is me and Sasha
have become super good friends because we
[SPEAKER_04]: did this podcast together and I hope we,
we get to make a friendship to Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only going to get rid of me soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have like 30, uh,
co-hosts because everyone that we do a
[SPEAKER_04]: show with, I fall in love with,
you know, I mean, a really good idea on
[SPEAKER_01]: that man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend is a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started, um, Cerebral feeds with Tony
from Sagar Matha with diamond from period.
[SPEAKER_01]: He opened the gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Amsterdam and he's so damn that he's
good at self-promoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there when all these legendary
crosses happened with Adam done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should get on here because he just
parted ways with a grow that he was really
[SPEAKER_01]: contingent on that for his income.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sparked an idea yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, with with you pioneering,
you started a seed company and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, why didn't I even think of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dude, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, get it going and I will help you
get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get some airplay and he was
there with the pioneers and you won't tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you that, but I think he met, he met the
stones in Amsterdam and was their weed
[SPEAKER_01]: dealer for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did security for the all steel will
tour over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you'd ever be open to get him one
there, that would not only be doing me a
[SPEAKER_01]: solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that make it happen to create
form on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying to number two happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you said you said he doesn't like
the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you make it happen that he does an
episode with us?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get off the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one thing about one thing about what
we're doing here, I think I owe him money
[SPEAKER_01]: for whenever I'm upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an hour long, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what are you going to give me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, we want to be a place
where people tell their story and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Mark, he's never he's been on
the Adam Dunn show and I love Adam and me
[SPEAKER_01]: and Adam go back to Amsterdam against you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're watching it, you talk a lot and
we got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get these words out there to the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the most respectful way, Adam,
have you ever seen this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been friends with him for a long
time, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, well, what I what I want
to do with this podcast is I want to give
[SPEAKER_04]: people a platform to tell their story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I was going to say is,
you know, a lot of people may look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: title and they see Mark Gallo and they're
going to say, well, who's this guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have a compelling story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a really compelling story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and so that's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if he wants to do the show,
it sounds like, you know, he's got a
[SPEAKER_04]: compelling story.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would be honored to have him do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that I want to do,
man, and he let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even when this all happened,
man, the sodium understated, I think once
[SPEAKER_01]: he got into it, he would like to spark a
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his story needs to be heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his is some of the rarest,
most sought after cultivars that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's got quite a lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let him tell you and we'll save it
for the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say let's save it for the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one other thing that I want to add.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I've talked to you about it is
something else that we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_04]: here on this channel is make a place for
smaller growers to tell their stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Home growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing about it is, you know,
a lot of people, they share these stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like a fantasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, man, you know, I could never do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when they see pictures or videos of a
commercial grow, it doesn't inspire them
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to make a place where closet
gardeners can be proud of their garden and
[SPEAKER_04]: they can tell their story about how they
were first exposed to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you did, like when you told us when
you were, you know, planting your first
[SPEAKER_04]: plants in your compost pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people want to hear those stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, when you see a nice closet
garden or a little tent garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that inspires more people to grow
their own that when they see the Jungle
[SPEAKER_04]: Boys with a massive, you know,
multi-tier grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, Gabby, I got to say, I got to say
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it to you before, but I want this
to get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dankest weed I've ever seen in my life
was grown in someone's basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown in someone's truck grow with a
creaky, HPS-like chemical, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: or in a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where these people under every
little rock, like you had said earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: in cremice are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, the dankest weed I've
ever seen do not come from a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's invalidating what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a voice that's just on a smaller
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people whisper, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people scream, I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's humility or like,
you know, when I talk to these people,
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, well, who wants to hear my story?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would somebody want to hear my story?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's more people like them than
there are people that are growing on a
[SPEAKER_04]: large scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so, like I said,
I want to encourage home growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, so with home growers, it's a little
bit different, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't bring every home grower onto the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what we're doing is we're trying to
encourage them to send us submissions,
[SPEAKER_04]: like make a video at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our podcast does not look professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a fancy studio.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the lights shining in the window
making a huge shine on my bald head,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I know is, you know, terrible for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like I said, I really want
this place to be a place where anyone can
[SPEAKER_04]: tell their story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, having said that, I want to give you
guys a little insight on the interview
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're doing tomorrow, because I'm
literally freaking out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy, he made strains for the cartels.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, but the cartels, I'm trying to
remember what the guy's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you watch the Netflix special
Narcos, the guy who... El Chapo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't El Chapo, the Mexican one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tinaloa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like the guy that invented Sensimea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what his name is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the guy that invented Sensimea,
he got the genetics from this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've known him for 30 years and he
told me these stories a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he actually saw the Kraft YouTube
channel and he made a comment and I asked
[SPEAKER_04]: if he wanted to tell his story.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's never told his story before publicly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been up all night thinking about
like, how ridiculous this podcast is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's probably going to have to be like
multiple episodes because he has the
[SPEAKER_04]: craziest stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I would never do it justice and I
don't want to be a spoiler.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm glad you did your podcast first
because like, I'm like, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ever going to live up to this podcast
that we're going to do tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm never going to be able to do a
better one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you how.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get this for synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very close friend of mine lived with
them too and they might know each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be just insanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk about it on the daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that's why he doesn't like animals
because he dreams a lot about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that happened down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could possibly get him on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even crazy that that's
actually happening because I speak to this
[SPEAKER_01]: person on the daily and he's got pictures
of him there and he would wait for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably shouldn't, but I want to read
some of this that he sent me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to look at my history on what
we watch when we're streaming,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's either cartel related stuff,
true crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I asked him to give me like a short
description.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I brought advanced genetics to
cartel marijuana operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That business, that proposition took me
into Mexico to the highest levels of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Guadalajara cartel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, I supplied genetics for
Rancho Buffalo, their giant cannabis farm
[SPEAKER_04]: in Chichua.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he said, I partied in San
Francisco and many other venues with
[SPEAKER_04]: Rafael Caro-Quintero, who invented
Sensemilla and Miguel Felix Guerriero,
[SPEAKER_04]: head of the Guadalajara cartel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like this is the show Narcos that was
on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy lived the life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They represent you on the show Narcos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, in Narcos Mexico season two,
the first episode depicts a party at
[SPEAKER_04]: Gallardo's estate in Mexico City,
where Al Chapo gave Gallardo a Bengal
[SPEAKER_04]: tiger as a gift.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, I was the only gringo at that
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to save the rest, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude, I love that gang.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I'm just like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I asked him and he's like,
I've never told this story publicly
[SPEAKER_04]: before.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he tells friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me 30 years ago, you know,
when I met him, all this shit that he used
[SPEAKER_04]: to be into and.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next show is going to be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all in, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will totally listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll totally share it on my Instagram that
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just copy and paste the language you
like the news, preempt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it on all kinds of platforms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I really want, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are people that, you know,
that would like to tell their story,
[SPEAKER_04]: please connect us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so far, the couple of people that you
mentioned, I think they would be great for
[SPEAKER_04]: our show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I whole act of there's a closer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you have any other genetics you want
to talk to us about, like your current
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: The current menu, there's a lot of new
outcrosses on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got lucky and O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal did a discreet auction that was
only in his story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never win anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I won the lottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to get the others were donated
by someone who won the lottery,
[SPEAKER_01]: found out the Philly Roger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to get O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal's legit Wi-Fi 3, O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal's Wi-Fi 43, Skywalker O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: and O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal's Lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one new app.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the one new outcross doing really
well and calling Jedi Master.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is Skywalker O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: times 04 Bog, Sour Bubble, BC2F2 from
Bog's first drop and arguably the best
[SPEAKER_01]: iteration from Boghead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jedi Master is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is Violet Buregard, which is 90
film of lavender crossed through the same
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour Bubble mail and big buds of floral
lavender with the back end of coffee from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Bubba Kush influence from the Sour
Bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just delicious, nutritious, terpian tasty
to the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going down the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miracle Bubble Mints Capulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the Cap Junkie Cross by the same
Sour Bubble mail and Gandaya's Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chabad from 707 made the cross,
was shared by Gandaya's Farms on ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taken that three by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically a match up on the best Sour I
found with the best S, F, E, O,
[SPEAKER_01]: G and C form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial yields, red outside,
very resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's Sour Gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Terp for the O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resonance.
[SPEAKER_01]: All box checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the next one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said the Jon already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go into what the nomenclature was
of the Jon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wifi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Jon is Wifi 3 cut that I got from O
.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal crossed through the same Sour
Bubble mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skinny on that is that's for Indica
Overload lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massive prehistoric fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to be topped twice to really put out
longer veg time and you'll be rewarded
[SPEAKER_01]: with your wheelchair weed where you can
sit and watch Yentl and not get bored with
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
Recommended.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the good movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yentl of the Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the day ender people that don't
have a lot of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally Indica Overload.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Violet Burger Guard is the one
that I'm drooling over the most on your
[SPEAKER_01]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great one too and during our test
runs I think that might have been my
[SPEAKER_01]: wife's favorite flower and she's very
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's from Northern California so she
doesn't get excited about flower much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have an extensive list but people
should just check you out on your
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram.
Marcus Aurelius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a stoic and some of my all time
favorite quotes came from him and I got
[SPEAKER_01]: the nickname from my aunt who is a school
teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: She used to call me Marcus Aurelius and
it's still is a nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also I wanted to ask you, Gallo,
are you related to the Gallo family,
[SPEAKER_04]: the winemakers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm related to the other Gallo family,
the New York one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gangsters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like stories for another podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many I haven't even scratched
the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also related to the Gallos and Tulsa,
Oklahoma had the first pizza shop in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1950s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sasha's done two podcasts with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably going to have to do,
I mean like when we talk about his story.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably going to have to do about
four or five more until we even scratch
[SPEAKER_04]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to invite you to do more as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super nice meeting you Sasha and I
really want to hear your story because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all valid to what's going on
currently in your area and all over Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think we're going to see more
synergy between the states and Europe as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis legalizes, more expansion and
hopefully we can all build long term
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: With one another and keep some synergistic
flow moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: The true people will always find a way to
communicate and connect on the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter where you're from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think globally also watch this now,
not only Europe and America and USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will spread and it's the biggest
community actually you can have because
[SPEAKER_06]: you will be spitting truth all the time
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never let an invisible fence get in
the way of me making friends or anyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: ethnicity, religion or political
inclination.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, it's steasy and
it's cliche.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all one and we are closely related
than we think and there should be more
[SPEAKER_01]: camaraderie, especially in the cannabis
industry because we're here for the love
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certainly not here to get rich,
my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't suck if it happened by
happenstance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good way to look at it, money procured
through cannabis is it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: motivation, the monetary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the primary motivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: The perk comes from the passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great way to leave this
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just thank you once again,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you, we're going to have
to have you come back on for at least one
[SPEAKER_04]: more podcast to keep telling us stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to close on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every podcast I've super enjoyed goes so
fast because there's so much good content
[SPEAKER_01]: and anyone needs to share.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode of Gabbing with Gabby is
brought to you by the Breeders Direct Seed
[SPEAKER_03]: Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, the Breeders Direct Seed
Company is your premier source for clones
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeds and they are the only place that
you can get the Gabby Staten Island
[SPEAKER_03]: collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So visit Breeders Direct for all your seed
and clone needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching and I'll see you next
time.
