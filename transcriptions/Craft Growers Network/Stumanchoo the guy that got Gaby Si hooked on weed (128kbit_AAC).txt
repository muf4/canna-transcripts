[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, two men chewing the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two men chewing the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go outside, drink a beer,
and hang out with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is up?
My friend Gabe.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boy Gabe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known each other since March 15th,
1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: We joined Staten Island Judo together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that teacher who used to
beat the shit out of us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it to Luca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it to Luca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking remember everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I can't fucking... I
just want everybody to know, it took us an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour and 47 minutes and 22 seconds for me
to figure out how to wear a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I told you about 1982,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to hold the camera up higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I'm not looking up straight up
your fucking nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty, while Stu is swallowing,
what I want to say is this is one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: oldest friends and he's the first person
to give me marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's about to tell the story about
the first time I smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He smoked marijuana a couple of days
before me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead, Stu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so 1984.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was September 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: September 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right the week after, what do you
call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: After high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, two days
before that, Mark Sikawa, his mother,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked pot, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a tenant for, I think it was 16
Pilcher Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Suzy Milstein's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, I remember everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, what we did
was me and Mark, I said, Mark,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you have pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sneaks out a little, he goes into his
mother's, he goes all the way down and he
[SPEAKER_00]: cramps his fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was under the fucking bench or
whatever, was a brown thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put it on mute so that there
wouldn't be an echo, but hold the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, hold the phone so I can see your
ugly face.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, give me a pen and
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fucking, I can't stand the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, give me a pen and paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the present.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the future, it's the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about, I'm about 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just so you know, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, we smoked weed in 1985 or 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 1984, September 13th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Sikawa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Mark Sikawa, we smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes under the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was about five foot seven, 313 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I don't know why I'm bringing
that, but I'm giving you the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we smoked pot and I'm like,
yeah, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see this guy, Gabe, who Gabe had like
this curly-ish hair, wavy hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabe was like a Barbie doll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like a Barbie doll.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all about looking great for the
girls and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't give a shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're all about looking good and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say to him, now, I did it September
13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: September 15th, I see Gabe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, Gabe, I smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, yeah, I smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, you did not smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I said, you want to try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize I would start a fucking
guy to be the pothead of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so we go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, are you telling me truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, yeah, we smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was commercial weed, ladies and
gentlemen, and let me tell you how
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gabe now is an expert in that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows how good it is to me,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we stole the weed from Mark Sikawa's
mom, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes into the drawers and he grabs the
stuff and we smoke and stuff that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gabe's like, we're really doing it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see your face, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really doing it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I'm like, you know, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and he's like, we really, we really
high, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were more excited than me about it,
because I was always drunk, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was drinking for eight years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, he doesn't even know the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, during the Super Bowl, his mother
wanted me to hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to hang out with my brothers
because even though it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I was drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his mother kept it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother goes, why do you want to go to hang
out with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants you to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get my brother because I want
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want potato chips and pretzels.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to drink fucking whiskey at 11
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go in there and Gabe is smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing I know, fucking Gabe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabe has pinky up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, this is a great thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember that whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this motherfucker, he really
likes his shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, it's commercial weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember it was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know his shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember, this is a great story,
not a great story, a quick thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember how excited it was that
you discovered America like you were
[SPEAKER_00]: Christopher Columbus?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, dude, you know what I got today?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got chocolate Buddha weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, there's a fucking difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, that is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a fucking pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You loved it from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're the one responsible for all of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let me tell you another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in big smoke like he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, Gabe, do you mind me doing this
or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, go ahead and say anything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: In old days, guys, you could smoke
cigarettes outside in the courtyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently, Gabe said to me,
let's get some pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go over to something to get some pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get it for Gabe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Gabe, I'm a drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently, next thing you know,
Gabe goes, no, Stu, I really can't hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to do it quietly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The vice dean or something like that
caught you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Caught you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom doesn't want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want me to hang out with you
because you're a big pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a small pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were getting it from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got in trouble for your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your mother, my mother, she even said
to my mother one day at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: because my mother goes to me, Stu.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with the drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I'm a drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit, I'm a drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fucking pothead, not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell a story that has nothing to
do with that because it's the funniest
[SPEAKER_00]: story of my life, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of crazy stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my nephew comes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really a pothead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe once in a while, I want edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my father dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nephew starts hanging out with us at
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one night, I said to him, I want to do
an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go to my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hang out downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hang out in the big house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother is all the way on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hang out, 80 inch TV,
relax, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, apparently, this is my big
word, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, we're downstairs and the glass
table lands on top of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nephew, stupidly, because he just goes
upstairs, leaves me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He promised me he would stay with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He leaves me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently, he lands on top of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, this 249-year-old woman
comes downstairs, runs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hears everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, she hears everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: She comes downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, Stu, Stu made two, if I can call
myself that, lands on top of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass table lands on top of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden, she goes, why is that
glass table?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what your mom wants to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is a glass table on top of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing to fall on top of a glass
table, but how is a table on top of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm a silly duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, I was sitting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass on the table, you know how
sometimes it tilts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow, it lands on top of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, this 249-year-old woman hears
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She comes downstairs, marching like a
motherfucker, and she goes, Stu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is the glass table on top of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she looks at me and she goes,
and why are you naked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, so I'm naked now on this
edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she goes, why are you naked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my nephew says to me the next
day, he goes, funny as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, you know what you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, Mom, I'm not naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I put my shoulders up like Big Shot,
I'm in a nude suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine telling a 249-year-old
woman this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now listen, one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your mother, so don't be
disrespectful and call her a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she's a father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you said she's a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I said, me the motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I'm drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's a father fucker, not a
motherfucker, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying is how funny that she
goes, why are you naked?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, nah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put myself up like, I'm in my nude
suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen,
if you want to see the best reality show,
[SPEAKER_00]: me and my mother would be as funny as
characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to stop this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, Stu.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good?
