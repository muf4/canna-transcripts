[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to do it in the lab because
everybody has to stop working when they're
[SPEAKER_03]: filming and I can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they complain, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because it's being used so widely in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and so many states have approved it and
the same is happening in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when something which is not well known
is being so widely used, people come out
[SPEAKER_03]: and start asking questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: How?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the type of diseases it can do?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the scientific background?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the side effects?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quite a lot of people come around and
start asking questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you both something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like a weight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel a weight and a sort of a
pressure to keep discovering things or to
[SPEAKER_02]: live up to your discoveries in a way?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure that I think along those
pathways.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing, in the lab in Jerusalem,
we've been working since 1964.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Harnoush worked in the Czech state a
little bit later and these were two
[SPEAKER_03]: individual, separate researchers then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lumet joined our lab about 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that we have to find new
things all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of what we do all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them succeed and some of them
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we find new things and sometimes
we don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it depends on what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, most people are interested in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabidiol, THC in the plant and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that we did and Lumet
and the Czech researchers did it
[SPEAKER_03]: separately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, 30, 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it about 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Work on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Identification of the active compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the active compound THC was only
partially known when we started working
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The structure was unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not available for research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, that's a major problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is contrary to morphine, which had
been isolated from opium 150 years
[SPEAKER_03]: previously, or cocaine, which had been
isolated from coca leaves 100 years
[SPEAKER_03]: previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they had been investigated
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we have a strange situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a plant that's being widely used
in various forms, marijuana, hashish,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the science behind it was rather weak
because the active compound or compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: had never been isolated in pure form and
they could not be investigated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the 60s, we went first into that
direction, isolating the THC and many
[SPEAKER_03]: other compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we re-isolated cannabidiol and quite a
lot of other compounds, quite many of them
[SPEAKER_03]: new compounds that had never been isolated
previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: We identified their structures and then we
started looking at the metabolism,
[SPEAKER_03]: the activity and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this went for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is essentially the first stage of
cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Work on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemistry, biology, clinical effects,
and we did some clinical trials just as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is something that we did in the
60s, early 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did some clinical work and I can tell
you about it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was the first stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that was not known at that
point, how does it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the mechanism of cannabinoid work?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turned out that there are
receptors, proteins in the brain and in
[SPEAKER_03]: the body that THC binds to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these receptors, there are two of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, when activated causes the well-known
effects of marijuana, the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one does not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Binding of THC to that particular receptor
causes only protective actions and doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: cause the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So THC binds to both these receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we don't have receptors in our body
because there is a plant out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have receptors in our body because we
produce compounds that activate these
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors when needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went ahead looking for these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, a fellow who had worked on
the receptors joined as a post-doctoral
[SPEAKER_03]: fellow and Lumir Hanus came from the Czech
state as a visiting scientist and then he
[SPEAKER_03]: has been here with us now for the last,
he came for six months, 20 years ago and
[SPEAKER_03]: he's still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's completely an entrepreneur
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's something else you see
retired from the university.
[SPEAKER_03]: The university, one has to retire at the
age of 68 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went ahead looking for the compounds
that our body produces that activate these
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we believe, I see it as the second
stage of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second stage meaning not the compounds
from the plant, the compounds that we
[SPEAKER_03]: produce that activate these receptors and
cause a lot of effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And indeed, we worked and at that time,
as I said, Dr. Hanus had joined us and Dr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Devane had joined us and quite a few
others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was in collaboration with several
groups abroad, the compounds in it we were
[SPEAKER_03]: discovering were also tested in the UK and
tested in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found eventually two compounds that
our body produces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemically, they're completely different
from the compound that the plant produces,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they have the same activity more or
less.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we called one of them an andamide and
the other one 2-AG ananda in Sanskrit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know Sanskrit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I speak it every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we found that ananda is supreme joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we called the compound anandamide
and we elucidated its structure and
[SPEAKER_03]: synthesized it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same with the second compound
2-AG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these two compounds are present in the
body, made by the body when and where
[SPEAKER_03]: needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they act when and where needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if somebody has been injured
and there is pain, the body will produce
[SPEAKER_03]: anandamide and 2-AG in that area in order
to lower the pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are involved in a huge number of
additional actions in the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, the researchers at
NIH, National Institute of Health in the
[SPEAKER_03]: US had a review and they said,
these two compounds, as a matter of fact,
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole system of endocannabinoid
system, the receptors, the compounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on, are involved in essentially all
human diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very strong statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are because they do several
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They regulate some of the other
neurotransmitters in the body and they
[SPEAKER_03]: have actions of their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are extremely important and
therefore, there has been a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: work on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thousands of papers have been published on
anandamide and 2-AG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know quite a lot about their
activity within the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see that as the second stage of
cannabinoid research, showing how this
[SPEAKER_03]: endogenous cannabinoid system works in the
mammalian body, in our body, and how it is
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with everyday life,
mood, happiness, sorrow, and so on,
[SPEAKER_03]: and with disease states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is parallel to the immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: The immune system guards us against all
kinds of things happening to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the immune system, we'll be dead
within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: The activation of one of the receptors,
it's called the CB2 receptor, activation
[SPEAKER_03]: of one of the receptors helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, activation of the
endocannabinoid system of the CB2 receptor
[SPEAKER_03]: is apparently extremely important in
guarding us against all kinds of things
[SPEAKER_03]: that are happening in the body and we want
to prevent them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know enough about it,
but we know quite a bit and we have seen
[SPEAKER_03]: that in many diseases, activation of CB2
is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not completely parallel the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it adds to the immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point, we shall know,
I hope much better, how these two systems
[SPEAKER_03]: work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: For someone who gets interviewed twice a
week about this, you seem very energetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to be at my age.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, we have moved to the third stage
of the cannabinoid research and there are
[SPEAKER_03]: very few people interested in that stage
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you in a few words what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The endogenous cannabinoids we have in the
body are formed, are not very complicated
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are formed from fatty acids like
oleic acids, which is present in olive
[SPEAKER_03]: oil, and amino acids which form the
proteins in the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we have a relatively simple
compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the body has prepared almost a hundred
of these, maybe more of compounds of the
[SPEAKER_03]: same type, fatty acids bound to amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't make a hundred compounds
because it has nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes them because it knows how to make
them and it needs them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have found that these compounds,
about a hundred of them, those that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have investigated, are of major importance
in our body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the third stage of cannabinoid
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that one of the compounds acts in
osteoporosis, the breaking down of bones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The background of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women after the age of 50, with all the
changes happening in the hormone levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: then they should have a lot of bone
damage, osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all women have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason is women, as well as men,
but women in this case, produce a compound
[SPEAKER_03]: which is closely related to the
endocannabinoids, closely related to
[SPEAKER_03]: anandamide, which blocks osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: In another field, with Professor Sohami,
we found that compounds of this type
[SPEAKER_03]: affect brain damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if somebody has brain damage,
the brain starts producing them and lowers
[SPEAKER_03]: the brain damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they do not block completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They act against osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The body starts breaking down the bone.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, our bones are not stable in the sense
that the same bones that you had when you
[SPEAKER_03]: were six years old will be when you're six
years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: The body changes them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, breaks them down and builds them
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breaks them down and builds them again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are cells that build the bones and
cells that break the bones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these compounds, endogenous compounds,
limit the action of the cells that break
[SPEAKER_03]: the bones and enhance the action of the
cells that build the bones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a regulator in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same is true for brain damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We recently found something else which is
also of major importance, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to find out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our body makes one compound of that type
that tries to block certain addictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, we worked only in nicotine
addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that our body makes a compound
that tries to block nicotine addiction and
[SPEAKER_03]: tries to block the effects that are caused
by addiction, the effect that caused after
[SPEAKER_03]: one stops taking an addictive drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it doesn't succeed always,
but sometimes apparently it does succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the research on addiction has been
done on the addicted people or addicted
[SPEAKER_03]: animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little work has been done on those
that are not addicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, with different addictive drugs,
only partial addiction, only depends on
[SPEAKER_03]: the drug, it may be 20%, 60%, 70% get
addicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't the other get addicted?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the body produces a compound that
may be compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We so far identified one compound and
published it, showing that it blocks
[SPEAKER_03]: nicotine addiction and it can block the
withdrawal effects, both of nicotine and
[SPEAKER_03]: of opiates in animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't tested that in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the next phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the body does that, it's a major
advance towards using such compounds as
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-addictive compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, we are at the third stage of
cannabinoid research, working on compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: that are somewhat related to the
endogenous cannabinoids, but have a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: effect in many, many other medical
situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to ask you a few things about
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't discovered THC and if
Lumiere hadn't discovered nanolide,
[SPEAKER_02]: would someone else have discovered it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to think that we are the only
geniuses in the world, but it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_03]: that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science advances.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are happy to make an important
step, but chances are that if we hadn't
[SPEAKER_03]: done it, somebody else would have done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with cannabis, it was rare for many
years for anyone to study it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we would be very far behind
if you guys didn't?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have contributed, yes,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science moves ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's based on individuals, but science
moves ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are that if we had not discovered
or identified the structure of THC of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol, somebody else would have done
it, maybe a few years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the things we did pushed the whole
field ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: But chances are it would have been done by
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: The discovery of anandamide into AG,
again, chances are that it could have been
[SPEAKER_03]: discovered later.
[SPEAKER_03]: As regards the third stage, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy who runs Daddy Meili's lab with
him told me that when they first opened
[SPEAKER_02]: the lab, the Technion was against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, okay, we'll let you open it,
but they were embarrassed by it or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so sure about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got millions in order to set up the
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean is that he said that when
people came to visit the Technion,
[SPEAKER_02]: they wouldn't come to show them the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm getting at is, is there a fear of
the establishment in studying cannabidiol?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at the Hebrew University.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, when I moved here in
1965, they asked me to move over after I
[SPEAKER_03]: was at the Weizmann Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here they suggested I should set up an
independent unit, which I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: The university never had any objections to
what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, the professors at the
university didn't look at it as something
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe should not be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact is that I was well accepted
personally and my research was well
[SPEAKER_03]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many years ago, I was elected by the
professors, by the Senate of the
[SPEAKER_03]: university, to head the university as
academic head of the university as rector.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they thought that we're working on
something that is objectionable,
[SPEAKER_03]: they wouldn't have done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a positive sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did they not think that you were
working on something objectionable?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was illegal in Israel, just like
everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why was it acceptable, do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why was it okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's illegal to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not illegal to do research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people do research on illegal
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the investigations in law have to
do with breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there are two different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were not doing anything illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, our work was
supported originally, not financially,
[SPEAKER_03]: by giving us without having to pay
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got cannabis from the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original work was done by quite a lot
of cannabis that I got from the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never had any problems with the Ministry
of Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, they consulted me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never had any problems with the National
Institute of Health in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, I was given an award
by the National Institute of Health for
[SPEAKER_03]: our work on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very different in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, but I got the award in America
for our research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the laws are complicated there.
[SPEAKER_03]: More complicated than here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people have to get all kinds of
approvals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same is here, but here we are a small
country and I have no problems getting the
[SPEAKER_03]: approvals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ministry of Health actually sometimes
have some of my students there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've never had any problems getting
approvals as long as we did our work
[SPEAKER_03]: legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we always did our work completely
legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never had any legal problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it worth studying cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should we bother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we bother because it's something of
importance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in a university, this is a little bit
strange to ask why.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, something exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that cannabis, it has been known
for thousands of years, that cannabis has
[SPEAKER_03]: two types of effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: It causes what we call the high today,
but it also has medicinal effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should study that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should know why cannabis does that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are different compounds that cause
the recreational effect versus the
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should learn about all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Academics try to work on things that are
in their eyes important, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: important to the community in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to decide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it turns out that academics
find things that later on turn out to be
[SPEAKER_03]: of major importance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give you numerous examples of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breaking the atom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cared about the atom being broken
down?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it did matter because it is the
basis of atomic energy and, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_03]: atomic bombs and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares about a certain place in the
brain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we do care.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we try, I mean, individually.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not told from above.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the major difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Academics, a professor at the university,
decides on his own what he wants to do
[SPEAKER_03]: research on.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not being told from the top,
do research on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to decide on his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the best way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why universities in the West,
in Europe, in the US, obviously in
[SPEAKER_03]: England, Germany, France, so on,
has advanced much more than in many other
[SPEAKER_03]: countries, because there the individual
decides what he has to do, not somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: who is on the top and decides for
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, when you're working in front
of a microscope, do you think about
[SPEAKER_02]: greater context, about societal context at
all, or do you just look for what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Louis Pasteur in the 19th century
said that chance helps the prepared mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you look for something, you have a
plan, you look for something, but if you
[SPEAKER_03]: know a little bit more, you know what's
going on, and you see something happening,
[SPEAKER_03]: then chances are you can explain something
new.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, new things happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes these new things are of major
importance, but in most cases,
[SPEAKER_03]: these new things can be observed by people
that have the background to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I mean is, you meant something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing science research in a
room, in a lab, do you think about the
[SPEAKER_02]: connection between this research and all
of society using this research later,
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you not think that way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is exactly what I told you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Society is something very large.
[SPEAKER_03]: A scientist is not thinking of society
every minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the evening, when he looks at his
results, says, well, maybe society will be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested, and so on, but he has a plan,
he has to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe his work will prevent some kind of
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the work we are doing on addiction
will prevent or slow down addiction,
[SPEAKER_03]: in many cases, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, that's what I read,
65,000 people died of opiate addiction,
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly opiate addiction in the states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe by helping with the withdrawal
symptoms, we can help that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can block the withdrawal symptoms,
then many people will be able to get out
[SPEAKER_03]: of their addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the moment, many of them are afraid of
the withdrawal symptoms, so they continue
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the opiates in order not to get
withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a simplified way of telling it,
but it has something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we looked at cannabis, well,
we knew, we know, we knew that a large
[SPEAKER_03]: number of people are using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can learn something about it,
and we have learned not only about the
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational effects, we have learned
something about the medical effects,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I believe that within the next decade
or two, or so, we shall have quite a few
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid-based drugs on the market in
various fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give you a few examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work on cannabidiol, a major compound
found in cannabis, which is not
[SPEAKER_03]: psychoactive, it doesn't cause the high,
and people would have thought,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, so it's not of major interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is of major interest, because
cannabidiol is a major possible drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have seen that in epilepsy,
it blocks epileptic attacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We published that 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabidiol blocked epileptic attacks in
patients that nothing else was helping
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the neurologist was not very
interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody was very interested until parents
found out that plants that contain a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabidiol, maybe they saw our work,
or maybe they just learned it from other
[SPEAKER_03]: sources, they found that cannabidiol helps
children with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are children that have 20,
30 attacks a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cannabidiol helps them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our work on the prevention of epileptic
attacks by cannabidiol is an important
[SPEAKER_03]: medical step forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, about 150 children in Israel are
getting extracts with a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol that blocks their epileptic
attacks, so these children would not,
[SPEAKER_03]: normally, will not be able to develop with
20 attacks a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, they are more or less normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S., a major study was done based
on what we did 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they showed that it's of major
importance in epilepsy, so here we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: medical advance based on the basic science
on identifying cannabidiol, looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol in animals, finding out that
it's anti-epileptic, then going into
[SPEAKER_03]: humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't always work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We showed that in diabetes type 1,
which is an autoimmune disease,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol is of major help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nobody has done that in humans,
which is a shame because it helps in
[SPEAKER_03]: animals, exactly the same mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps with diabetes type 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why it has not been tested in humans is
beyond me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs a lot of money to do clinical
trials, but I have no doubt that when
[SPEAKER_03]: tested in humans, it will show the same
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabidiol has been shown to be an
excellent anti-schizophrenic drug in
[SPEAKER_03]: schizophrenic patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, schizophrenia is not a minor disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: One percent of the population in every
country has schizophrenia, so we're
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with millions, and there are drugs
against schizophrenia, but they cause side
[SPEAKER_03]: effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabidiol does not cause side effects,
and once it is pushed forward,
[SPEAKER_03]: chances are that it will become a major
anti-schizophrenic drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we see a lot about autoimmune
diseases, namely diseases in which the
[SPEAKER_03]: body attacks itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the body attacks itself is a
complicated question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, in most cases, don't know much about
it, but in essentially all autoimmune
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases that have been tested in animals,
we see that cannabidiol helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the basic work that was done on
cannabidiol may turn out to be of major
[SPEAKER_03]: importance in medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was known that cannabis is an
anti-epileptic agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, there are all kinds
of individual reports over hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: years on and off, and I'd like to quote
somebody in the Muslim world, a major
[SPEAKER_03]: person in the Muslim world in the 15th
century.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had epilepsy, and somebody brought him
cannabis, and he didn't have epileptic
[SPEAKER_03]: attacks, but he had to continue taking the
drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was actually written and described in
the 15th century, and the document was
[SPEAKER_03]: found about 20 years ago in Paris by a
friend of mine, Dr. Rosenthal,
[SPEAKER_03]: who worked at Yale.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have information of the 15th century,
and most probably it was also used for the
[SPEAKER_03]: same purpose in India, to a certain
extent, India, China, and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, when we started work, we had some
individual information, but today
[SPEAKER_03]: individual information is not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: One needs information on humans,
one needs a scientific medical way of
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need people that take placebo,
namely take the same solvent or the same
[SPEAKER_03]: drug without the active compound,
and those that take the active compound,
[SPEAKER_03]: and who is doing the research should not
know who is taking the placebo and who is
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the active compound, and at the end
of the research one should do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we started working on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always work in collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: We collaborate with friends and colleagues
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, it was with a group in São
Paulo, in Brazil, and we first tested
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: We isolated huge amounts of Cannabidiol
from cannabis given to us by the police,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we sent them almost half a kilo of
Cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: They first tested it in animals,
animals with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tested, and then they went into human
patients, and they looked at the human
[SPEAKER_03]: patients for several months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here is how it is done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be done in collaboration between
chemists, in this case our group,
[SPEAKER_03]: biologists, in that case the work in São
Paulo, and the police that gave us the
[SPEAKER_03]: material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it has to be done in collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be obviously completely legal,
and it has to be well planned ahead,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've been doing that in collaboration
with many other groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: The addictive research and addiction is
done jointly in collaboration by four
[SPEAKER_03]: groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four independent groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, every one of them can say,
I don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they do because it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The addiction is done in collaboration by
our group, a group in Richmond,
[SPEAKER_03]: Virginia, a group in Canada, and a group
in Italy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We correspond.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tell each other what's going on,
and each one of us has his own specialty,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it can help the others who have some
other specialty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we do the chemistry and the general
background, the general idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people in Richmond work on nicotine
addiction and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people in Canada work on opiate
addiction, and the people in Italy work on
[SPEAKER_03]: addiction to food, actually, overeating
and so on, obesity, things of that sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard very interesting things about
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some doctors have told me, and researchers
have told me, that they think clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: trials might need to be adjusted or even
reinvented, rethought of for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-based medicine because its effect
seems to be so individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dendi Meili and someone else said they
completely disagree with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that it has to stay exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Moshe Hodol said it stays exactly
the same, and that they have to do just
[SPEAKER_02]: isolates and build up a pharmacology of
which cannabinoids work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have good research and you have
bad research.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't do it the right way,
it's bad research, and the results are not
[SPEAKER_03]: worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today, advancing in the chemical
medical side has to be done by good
[SPEAKER_03]: research of originally in animals and then
in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clinical trials have to be done
according to rules that are well accepted
[SPEAKER_03]: by clinicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if somebody does a lousy research,
well, it's a lousy research.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the good research is good research.
[SPEAKER_03]: One has to look at the research as it is
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without clinical trials, today a compound
cannot become a drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for cannabis medicine, can we do
clinical trials the exact same way we do
[SPEAKER_02]: it for other medicines, same methods?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One can take a compound, cannabidiol,
and give it to schizophrenics,
[SPEAKER_03]: take the same solution that contains the
cannabidiol, but does not contain the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol itself, only the solvents and
all the formulation there, and give it to
[SPEAKER_03]: other patients at the placebo.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are basic rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the German group that
published on cannabidiol in schizophrenia
[SPEAKER_03]: did an excellent job.
[SPEAKER_03]: The work that was just completed in the US
on epilepsy, a large number of epileptic
[SPEAKER_03]: children.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an outstanding research proposal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had to be approved by many other
clinicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs, unfortunately, millions to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once it's well done, it should be well
accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clinicians have to base their day-to-day
work on clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: These clinical trials have to be
outstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do clinical trials with stuff
that's not just isolated compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: like with full-spectrum plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is more difficult because it's
doing it with a single compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: One can say, what are the amounts of the
single compounds, how often, how it has to
[SPEAKER_03]: be given, and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: When a clinical trial is done with an
extract, then one has a problem because
[SPEAKER_03]: the extracts can differ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I assume that the people you talk to
and were negative, thought about extracts
[SPEAKER_03]: and not about well-defined compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working with extracts may be very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is because of something that we
discovered many years ago, which is called
[SPEAKER_03]: the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entourage effect means that there are
compounds in cannabis that change,
[SPEAKER_03]: modify the activity of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: They by themselves have no activity,
but they modify the activity of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have different compounds every
time you do a clinical trial or an animal
[SPEAKER_03]: trial, as a matter of fact, with an
extract, which is not exactly the extract
[SPEAKER_03]: you had previously or somebody else had
previously, then obviously you cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: compare because of the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that a barrier for research?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you overcome that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you work with well-defined material.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are very general statements.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go into very specific cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure cannabidiol is outstanding in many
diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of people that claim that
one has to use extracts in order to get
[SPEAKER_03]: better effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in some cases this is correct,
but in order to do a clinical trial,
[SPEAKER_03]: one has to do it with well-defined
extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is pure cannabidiol useful in many
indications that you've seen so far?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, we did work on epilepsy with
100% pure cannabidiol, crystalline.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people in Germany did work on
schizophrenia with 100% pure cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: The work in epilepsy in the state,
the clinical trial, was done with a
[SPEAKER_03]: compound which was almost pure CBD
extracted from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason they did it is because an
extract from a plant falls under different
[SPEAKER_03]: legal definition in the states.
[SPEAKER_03]: A pure compound has, that's what I
understand, I'm not a legal person,
[SPEAKER_03]: a compound that is pure has falls under
the jurisdiction of the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extract of a plant is something else,
so it's easier to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the extract falls under the DEA,
it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, plant extracts in the states
[SPEAKER_03]: are seen legally in a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a $50 billion business of
extracts, various plant extracts in the
[SPEAKER_03]: state, and the FDA has essentially,
it cannot say anything about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not the same as pure drugs,
pure compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The FDA has a lot to say about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we know about cannabis in
pregnancy and in birth and in women's
[SPEAKER_02]: health in general, and its effect on the
mother and the fetus?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, most women that still take cannabis
say that nothing major has happened,
[SPEAKER_03]: but sometimes it's thought that the
children that are born may be smaller and
[SPEAKER_03]: develop more or less normally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, I would strongly recommend
not to use anything during pregnancy,
[SPEAKER_03]: not cannabis, not any drug if possible,
because it's extremely difficult to know
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a drug which causes damage to
the fetus in 50% of the cases,
[SPEAKER_03]: this will be seen immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happens if the damage is seen
only in one fetus out of 1,000?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not seen in any clinical trial,
but the one damage is one damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That particular damaged baby is damaged,
and we don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely difficult to prove anything
of that sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we need statistical proofs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very difficult to work with things
that affect, I don't know, half a percent
[SPEAKER_03]: of the population or half a percent of the
fetuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I would normally suggest,
if a pregnant woman asked me, may I take
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis because it lowers the vomiting I
have during the pregnancy, I say,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just suffer the vomiting and don't take
anything, any drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is probably true for all kinds of
minor effects, but there we know that in a
[SPEAKER_03]: disease, it helps the disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pregnancy is not a disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pregnancy is a normal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there any things that you would
have done just since 1964 with this THC
[SPEAKER_02]: isolation?
[SPEAKER_02]: So since then, is there anything you would
have done differently that you think would
[SPEAKER_02]: have changed in any way, the way that the
industry, I'm calling it, has gone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, scientifically probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably I could have got more money to do
more research, but basically we went the
[SPEAKER_03]: right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I should have done better is try to
get industrial interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And still, although we know that these
compounds have activity, cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_03]: derivatives, cannabidiol, they are still
not sold as defined drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And possibly I could have pushed more for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Teva, the biggest company in
Israel, the biggest pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: company, is not really interested,
was not interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are that we could have pushed more
for that, but we didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But scientifically you feel like
everything was done the right way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe it could have been done
faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the group could have been larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: My group was always a small group of three
or four people working in different
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can't say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the work we do is collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a lot of collaboration with many
other groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: In research that is done between chemistry
and biology, one needs good collaboration
[SPEAKER_03]: between the chemists and the biologists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over the last 30, 40 years,
we have always had collaborators in
[SPEAKER_03]: various fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every aspect, anything that we do now,
is always in collaboration with people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are well-informed and know how to do
the biology or the clinical work and so
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emil, do you think there's anything that
you think should have been done
[SPEAKER_02]: differently over the years with cannabis
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the biggest problem in cannabis
research, cooperation between different
[SPEAKER_00]: nations, scientists from different
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis is stigmatized and it's
illegal drug, just to exchange of samples
[SPEAKER_00]: is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So samples sometimes are analyzed locally
and we cannot compare the samples in
[SPEAKER_00]: abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do locally even different
studies, but it's a problem to do it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the other country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I asked one of my friends in
the United States for some cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: standards, he told me, you know,
this permits export, import, it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better come to here and do it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be without any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see this is certain break,
you know.
Do you feel like people rolled their eyes
at you over the years and did you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: stigmatized over the years from people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did people look down at any of you for the
research that you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Other scientists, they ever say,
oh, those are the guys that do marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in my case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't complain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact is that I've been given prizes
all over the world in many countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have honorary doctorates from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and Canada and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the day-to-day level, you know,
from people that you meet, is it always
[SPEAKER_02]: like a joke to other people?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, as a matter of fact, most people think
that it's important to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody thinks otherwise, we are open
country, let him think otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did research in the United States,
in Czechoslovakia, in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cooperated also with criminalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no problem on a medicinal level,
on metal as a drug of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just only these relations, international,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit problem because of
reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give you an example of what Lumier
is saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I collaborate with a group in the U.K.,
a well-established group in the U.K.
[SPEAKER_03]: The person that heads that group has a
night hood, he's sir, and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I cannot send him the derivatives of
cannabidiol because of legal problems in
[SPEAKER_03]: the U.K.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was head of a major group at Oxford.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not somebody who is on the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's at the center of British research,
highly regarded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, I cannot send him the compounds
because of legal problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're not giving them to humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to test these compounds in
the test tube, and they're going to test
[SPEAKER_03]: these compounds in animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they are good drugs, then they have
to go through the official legal things in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to get into the humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nobody says that he's doing anything
illegal on the contrary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it frustrating to work for years with
this stuff that's completely illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you have to study things that
are illegal, but is it frustrating because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're discovering, hey, it works for
epilepsy, but we can't give it to anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's illegal?
[SPEAKER_02]: C'est la vie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you ever ready to give up because of
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why should I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever feel frustrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concerning the research, I was every time
very satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was every time wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can share any of our ideas on paper,
on emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only what's mentioned, Professor Meshulam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to send samples, it's complicated
what I told you that my friend told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, he wrote me,
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even I think if I won't bring some samples
from the other lab here, I need certain
[SPEAKER_00]: permit because I cannot take it and go by
car and have the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to have sample with permit because
if stop me sample, they say that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sample from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have permit with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never happened to me, but theoretically
I'm talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you see this cannabinoid medicine
getting into pharmaceutical drugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you see that process happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, things are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel, as a matter of fact, is pretty
well ahead of many other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medical cannabis can be administered here.
[SPEAKER_03]: One needs an approval by the ministry or
by physicians that are associated with the
[SPEAKER_03]: ministry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are about 35,000 patients that have
approval, which is a huge number,
[SPEAKER_03]: for well-defined diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Particularly in diseases that are not
associated with psychiatry, almost
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to work with cannabis,
a group has to get approval by the
[SPEAKER_03]: ministry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a committee, a major
committee that sits every three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it so happens that I'm chairman of the
committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I collaborate with the ministry and we
are very liberal in allowing people to do
[SPEAKER_03]: research in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody wants to do research in his
background, in his backyard, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll say no, because that's a way just to
make legal cannabis into illegal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's done in a university or a
well-established unit, government or a
[SPEAKER_03]: company, then they have no problem doing
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today there are, I don't know,
probably 50, 60 labs in this country that
[SPEAKER_03]: do research in cannabis and various
aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever expect that when you were
starting out that cannabis and marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: will become your life's work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is one of the topics we've
worked on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a natural products chemist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work on the chemistry of natural
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the chemistry, plants produce a lot of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Contrary to humans, so mammalians,
we produce, all of us produce the same
[SPEAKER_03]: type of compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We produce the same type of compounds,
more or less, like a cow or a duck or a
[SPEAKER_03]: pig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not with the plants, because we have a
immune system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants don't have a specific immune
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their immune system is based to a large
extent on compounds they produce and every
[SPEAKER_03]: plant family has more or less the same
type of compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are many families and therefore
there are thousands of compounds in the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a well-established field of
chemistry, chemistry of natural products.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at a plant of one type,
plant of another type, we find many
[SPEAKER_03]: different types of compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of these compounds, their
structures are unknown or their activity
[SPEAKER_03]: is unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my group has worked for the last 50
years on the chemistry of, and biology,
[SPEAKER_03]: of natural products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you optimistic about where it's
all going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think about optimistic or
pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to establish things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, they will turn out to be
positive in the sense that they can be
[SPEAKER_03]: used further on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't depend on an academic
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do much about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can investigate something.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can show that something is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk to the people that are
involved in promoting a compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can't go further on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clinical trials today, contrary to
what was in the past, cost a lot,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give you an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: When 100 years ago, insulin was
discovered, and insulin is the compound
[SPEAKER_03]: that our body makes in order to regulate
the sugars in our body, it was used
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately as a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an excellent drug, still being used
in one way or another, the insulin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anandamide, which we discovered 25 years
ago, has never been given to a human,
[SPEAKER_03]: never.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insulin was given within six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anandamide probably is a pretty good drug,
but it has never been given to a human
[SPEAKER_03]: because a company has to be interested and
has to spend many millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you surprised when you look around and
see just how big this is becoming?
[SPEAKER_02]: How accepted this is becoming and how much
research there is relative to when you
[SPEAKER_03]: were just... Well, I'm delighted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm delighted that the medical part of it
is developing, slowly, but it is
[SPEAKER_03]: developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: One should separate the medical use from
the recreational use.
[SPEAKER_03]: The medical use has to go according to
well-established medical routes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to go through toxicity and animals
and then into the human.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to be accepted by the physicians,
it has to follow the well-established
[SPEAKER_03]: medical rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recreational use is a social issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recreational use has to be decided by the
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's toxic or not, that's
something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, population all over the world
have decided or decided 100 to 200 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago that smoking tobacco is fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that people die out of smoking
tobacco doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been socially accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same is true for, let's say,
whiskey, 50% alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not very healthy, but it is
approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a social issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: One cannot come over and say, we should be
allowed to use cannabis recreation because
[SPEAKER_03]: it helps with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the logic there?
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no logic.
[SPEAKER_03]: These two things should be completely
separated.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is a medical issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other is a social issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you before about
anandamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting that we think of
cannabis medicine as cannabinoid-based,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we don't ever think about it as
endocannabinoid-based.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should it be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these are compounds that we make.
[SPEAKER_03]: If our body makes a compound, it makes it
for a certain reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: We more or less know what the reasons are.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no doubt that at some point
people will start using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give you an example from a
different field.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a compound in our body called
dopamine, and there is a major
[SPEAKER_03]: dopaminergic system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was known, but it was slowly
discovered that the lack of dopamine
[SPEAKER_03]: causes one disease, and too much dopamine
causes another disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much causes schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to block, if there isn't enough
in Parkinson's disease, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: one gives dopaminergic-type compounds to
the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is schizophrenia, one tries to
lower that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The body has to have a certain amount of
dopamine, not too much and not too little.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same is probably true for anandamide.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have come out claiming,
without any major proof, that migraine,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, is due to maybe a lack of
anandamide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, it's very difficult to do
work on migraine, because if you ask a
[SPEAKER_03]: mouse, do you have migraine?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't want to answer you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, it seems to be,
maybe it's true, so it has to be
[SPEAKER_03]: investigated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, in many of these diseases,
we find that anandamide or 2-AG,
[SPEAKER_03]: the two endogenous cannabinoids,
there is too much of them or too little of
[SPEAKER_03]: them, maybe we can do something about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can endocannabinoid-based diseases that
are related to the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_02]: be thought of as a nourishment issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, that if we're not making
enough endocannabinoids, we need
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid nourishment for some reason?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is still being investigated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that the endocannabinoid
system is involved in a huge, huge number
[SPEAKER_03]: of diseases, then obviously, we have to
think along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're most welcome in that case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping to have you guys talk about
something, or rather about research,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't really know about what,
because this was an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want a second or two,
we can talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see any difference between the
attitude in the Czech state, which you
[SPEAKER_03]: know very well, before, previously,
communist time, or a bit later?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the attitude today?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a big paradox, because in the
communist regime, everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not such easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked on cannabis in the Fegaistar
to work in 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, the first name when I came to
Professor Krejcile, the first name which I
[SPEAKER_00]: was familiar with was Professor Rafael
Besherov.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, even at that time, leading
authority, and this was the main brain
[SPEAKER_00]: concern in cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was first what I met.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Czechoslovakia, Professor Krejcile,
he started to work on cannabis in 1950
[SPEAKER_00]: when he discovered antibiotic principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to use it in medicine,
and it was used up to 1990 when I left for
[SPEAKER_00]: one year to Israel, what is 28 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even then from 1961, it was illegal drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use it without any problem for
treatment of patients in hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prepared extracts 20 years to the drug
store, and they prepared medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any problem, we cultivated
cannabis without fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never lost one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cultivate it on the same spot today,
overnight, there will be no cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before, patients were treated without
any problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, cannabis is legal in Czech Republic
five years, and they use only five
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fact, it's not accessible for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something like Sativates, which is
allowed, it's not accessible because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more expensive than it's pension of old
ill person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see certain problem here because
illegality became like harder pressure on
[SPEAKER_00]: that than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today situation is worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you are associated, I know that you
travel to a lot of East European
[SPEAKER_03]: countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have been in almost all the small
countries in Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the situation there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The best situation is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had several seminars in Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today in Macedonia, cannabis for treatment
is illegal since last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most medicinal compound is considered
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strange that CBD is not considered
like medicine, like this is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: like supportive compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Main is THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be extracts without any limit
of THC contents in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was many times in Slovenia, even we had
seminar in parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same in Serbia, in Croatia,
where we had seminar several times,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just only Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better situation maybe is in Austria
because they sell CBD extracts like 5%,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy it without any problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Czechoslovakia, I said it was used for
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today in Slovakia, what is separate?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the country today, everything is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, CBD, everything is illegal,
like in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So situation between Czech Republic and
Slovak Republic is quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Czechoslovakia, mainly cannabis was
cultivated in Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US, of course, things are different
because you have one state that cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: can be freely sold and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one when it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have one gram of cannabidiol in
your pocket on this side of the border,
[SPEAKER_03]: state border, not country border,
state border, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just walk at 10 meters past the
frontier, then you can go to prison for
[SPEAKER_03]: five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't make much sense, but that's
the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same is with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in the United States,
there was county where it was prohibited
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy alcohol, but one meter after the
border of this county was a liquor store
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chances are that things will change
within the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall have most probably plant
material, basically cannabidiol and
[SPEAKER_03]: derivatives, which come from the plant,
but companies will develop derivatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And derivatives will be sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see, the natural products are not
always sold because of various reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at penicillin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot buy penicillin in the
drugstore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Penicillin is not available as a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have derivatives of penicillin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are that we shall have the same
with cannabis, but because of the wide use
[SPEAKER_03]: of plant cannabis, you will have plant
cannabis sold for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will also have derivatives of
mostly cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll have two different types of
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we need a lot of experimental
studies and trials, clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: because up to now, when we were preparing
the derivatives of cannabis, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: successful, but at the end it was not
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only, I think, nabilon is used,
but not the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except that I use just cannabis extracts
like dronabinol, marinol, this is THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: or epidemiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is CBD, but others like was one
derivative for obesity, and then patients
[SPEAKER_00]: were depressed, even commit suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not such easy to prepare
derivative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, we cannot do it at the
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can do only rich pharmaceutical
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chance is about 5%, and they must
spend tens of millions of dollars for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not also such easy for
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope it will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, as you well know, we work now with
three or four companies in different
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects, and they're spending their money
in order to advance cannabinoid research
[SPEAKER_03]: and to advance cannabinoid drugs
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, they will succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope also, because you had from the time
when I came to the university and I heard
[SPEAKER_00]: your name for the first time, you had so
many wonderful ideas and some of them up
[SPEAKER_00]: to now were not fulfilled because of
illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that you didn't tell us the last
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, I am sure that your contributions
will be wonderful and that it will help
[SPEAKER_02]: the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, what kind of ideas that have not
been fulfilled?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the development of many of the
synthetic compounds, which are known to be
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good in animals, they have not
advanced to clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, the schizophrenia
trial, which was done, obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: in human patients and so on, has not
advanced cannabidiol to be accepted as an
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-schizophrenic drug, which is very
strange, but that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are that derivatives will be
better accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have made derivatives of cannabidiol,
which are better than cannabidiol itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chances are that sometime within the
next decade, who knows, cannabinoid drugs
[SPEAKER_03]: will be on the market and will be widely
used.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a derivative?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have published, for example,
cannabidiol with a fluorine atom on the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a fluoro cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have published that in collaboration
with a group in South America.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have shown that it is pretty good in
anxiety, lowering anxiety, pretty good in
[SPEAKER_03]: acting on other psychiatric diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have shown that cannabidiol itself is
pretty good in these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have recently shown that another
derivative, which is a derivative,
[SPEAKER_03]: the acid of cannabidiol, helps with
depression.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chances are that at some point,
some of these compounds will become major
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see depression and anxiety,
for example, are major diseases in Western
[SPEAKER_03]: society.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge number, huge percentages of the
population have anxiety or depression on
[SPEAKER_03]: and off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need compounds that do not cause
side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need simple compounds or compounds that
one doesn't have to be anxious taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: The compounds against anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the role of anecdotal evidence in
this research?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anecdotal is, according to the work,
anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have a person in Paraguay,
who knows where, saying that it helps
[SPEAKER_03]: against a certain disease that he has,
which is, well, an academic person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll say that's an interesting
observation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But until we have a clinical trial,
it's just anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, maybe this person,
by chance, was getting better anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he took the drug and, well,
maybe the drug has nothing to do with,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's getting better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to have well established clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there a moment where anecdotal
stuff becomes more than just one story
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not useful?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can base our work on anecdotal
data, but it will never, in a modern
[SPEAKER_03]: society, never make a drug, make a
compound become a drug just on the basis
[SPEAKER_03]: of anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: One needs clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the clinical trials, a new drug
will not be accepted, not by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will still be an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anecdotal cases is also a problem that
even if it was successful, this patient
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know which type of cannabis they
use, if it was high THC or high CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't return to this what was not
fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Meshulam already mentioned it,
that 35 years ago, they did legal research
[SPEAKER_00]: with a group from Brazil, and they found
that epilepsy can be treated with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to be anecdotal case,
or officially, by the law, illegal case,
[SPEAKER_00]: that parents treated child with
cannabidiol-rich cannabis, and they found
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can treat this drovet syndrome,
what is a hard type of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was fulfilled what was idea
already 35 years ago, and this was legal
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposed to be illegal practice
just to fulfill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you, and this is the last
example.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 100 autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 10 of them are very central
autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diabetes type 1, rheumatoid arthritis,
many other diseases are autoimmune
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our body attacks itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most definitely, cannabidiol has been
found to act very positively in autoimmune
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, a group here at the
Bellingham Hospital looked at something
[SPEAKER_03]: that is more or less like an autoimmune
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: In many cancer patients, one has to
exchange part of the body and the bone
[SPEAKER_03]: marrow with bone marrow from outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the body doesn't like bone marrow from
the outside, and it attacks the bone
[SPEAKER_03]: marrow, the new bone marrow, and the new
bone marrow attacks the body, and the
[SPEAKER_03]: patient is sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be done because there is nothing
else that can be done with these cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: But many of them are sick, and this is
called graft-versus-cold disease,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is an autoimmune disease more or
less.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a group at Bellingham thought,
I was a little bit involved with them,
[SPEAKER_03]: a group at Bellingham Hospital thought
that maybe as cannabidiol is an autoimmune
[SPEAKER_03]: disease drug, let's give them cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave them cannabidiol, and the
results were outstanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely helps in graft-versus-cold
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a company has taken up now this
particular information by the Bellingham
[SPEAKER_03]: Hospital, and they are developing
cannabidiol as a drug in the case of
[SPEAKER_03]: graft-versus-cold disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So chances are that we'll have cannabidiol
as a drug, hopefully again, within the
[SPEAKER_03]: next three, four, five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this particular case, cancer being
treated after bone marrow with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're most welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
