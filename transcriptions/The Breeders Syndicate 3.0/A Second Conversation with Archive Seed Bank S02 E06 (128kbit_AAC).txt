[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know how to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some good questions at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know about any of the history of
Trinity, the cut that's going around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that it came out of Eugene,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know anything else other
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I've seen recently does not
remind me of what I used to buy out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more recent thing is a lot more
modern, sweet smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember that all the Trinity that
I ever saw, even the different phenols or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever jars of weed that were coming
around that were called Trinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: it always was burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't roadkill, it was burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: The newest Trinity, a lot of them have dud
branches and I ended up with one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking dud branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: It spreads pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're not keeping the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dudding likes to proliferate in low
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats seem to be a vector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard that in aphids and
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much anything that chews on your
plants is probably going to be a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good vector for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, chews on your roots also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those that has the fucking
rubbery stems with no texture,
[SPEAKER_02]: three flowers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugly fucking things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's your favorite breeder, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, there's good varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite breeder is Accidental Herming.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have a breeder you looked up to
when you first started though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just a seed buyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't idolize people that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really about the person so much
to me as it was just the product that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the people that I got into,
I immediately regretted once I met them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like DJ Short and some other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't want to talk about shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the benefit of having met a lot of
those people early in my career or having
[SPEAKER_00]: run across them with the Seattle Hemfest
stuff and all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that saying about not meeting your
heroes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they might not stand up to the
standard you have in your mind or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it wasn't so much about the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what kind of work you're doing and
what are the results from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a pretty smart answer too
because a lot of people are dicks that do
[SPEAKER_02]: good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here for the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care about who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has nothing to do with it for me
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people have misguided
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have that much data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have short sequence genome testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to Kevin's shit,
he's much more knowledgeable about the
[SPEAKER_00]: science behind it than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was just like, what are they
really going to be able to do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways?
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of my stuff is in their galaxy
that I didn't send in because they're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to just go purchase the product and put it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you really going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only can you not send them the product
and all these other things, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: have your product on the shelf somewhere
because they can just buy it, put the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking stem in, and then do their short
sequence analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do to stop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they were legitimate about it or
weren't, what difference is it going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still acquire all the data that
they want anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: The short sequence data, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Kevin said it best, dude,
when he broke it down, explained how it
[SPEAKER_02]: works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin from Medicinal Genomics,
when he broke it down and explained how it
[SPEAKER_02]: works, he ran their data through his
software and it just dumped everything out
[SPEAKER_02]: as invalid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are missing the main,
main points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they lied.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all get that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does 95% of everybody else that exists
in this space too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I call out so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because there's blatant evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even me just making shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's high times articles where they
fucking admit to this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you expect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else you guys got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some good strain history
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one for you so we can put to rest
some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple, mad farmers family or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really read into it,
but I find it highly unlikely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the same odds as Crippy
coming from Kauai and making OD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what other 20 different fucked up
stories that someone has made up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 10 years that is obvious bullshit
that some, for some reason, people
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same reason we still hear fucking
OG Kush is like Kim, Paki, lemon tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ocean grown story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how many times do like how many
people have to say how shy see that person
[SPEAKER_00]: is for people to stop believing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you know about the Oregon funk and
or blue dots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any experience with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dot, like I said last time was a cut
down the Bay area and what was the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw Oregon funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about the Josh D story?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every person that I know that got
OG back then, it all leads back to Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, from my perspective,
it's as legitimate as it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody traces back to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's that's one of the only few
people that actually can has everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: trace back to him that wasn't 100%
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw I saw pictures like the film
negatives from Josh of him and Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next picture in the film
negatives is OG Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's I mean, the plant is really easy
to identify once you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's pretty obvious to me that
they got more evidence of having it back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the late 90s than anybody else had ever
met.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you feel was your most slept on
release?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, certain stuff you just
expect to move slow because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, dog shit crosses even as popular
as it was back in the Northwest back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the name doesn't translate well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could see that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cat piss crosses also same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really that popular, but the name
was always really popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, the San Diego cat piss is a fucking
legend, though, like like being from San
[SPEAKER_02]: Diego and shit like that was the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can't believe that doesn't
sell better than it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's you know, you just don't have
people rapping about it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if it had been called Cheetah Piss,
we'd all it all be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheetah cookie piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lion piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobcat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albert Walker across the face off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it coming back?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never released it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that never got sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had the Albert Walker manic line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the number 32 line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you what can you tell us about
the manic?
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from shroomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there was a female and a male that
came from he said they came from some
[SPEAKER_00]: family in the Humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had IBL'd it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one had no one that I knew had used the
male yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just I have to them and then made
hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your man?
[SPEAKER_00]: The manic female was like purple oracle
without the purple smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like same growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real similar blood structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got it would turn purple on the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just had that like, really sweet,
skunky smell that that the oracle has that
[SPEAKER_00]: oracle has but just without that like
purple lavender kind of top end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always thought that was
interesting with the oracle as it as it as
[SPEAKER_02]: it grows like when it's first in bloom,
it's really skunky and you wouldn't expect
[SPEAKER_02]: it to turn grapey at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you grow it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can finish pretty skunky too.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oracle and manic both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one Golden Coast Brotherhood of
Eternal Love Afghan anyone ran it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I actually have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's a good Afghan, but it's not
skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not anything that wasn't what I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your what's your rules on breeding
with your gear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, it's not about my gear,
their gear, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just put in some work so that we have
differentiation between people selections
[SPEAKER_00]: in their line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not putting any selections
in, then what are you really doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just putting more of the same thing
into the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And poor and poorly selected that if you
didn't do any didn't do any selection
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's just popping a pack of seeds and
picking the first female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get really lucky or you could
just be proliferating a bunch of garbage
[SPEAKER_00]: under the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's either diluting the original
work or maybe it maybe makes it better in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most cases, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Loompa farm split up hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, got to be better questions than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't alien the breeder of fruity
pebbles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure alien genetics was
supposed to be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever find anything worthwhile
worthwhile in the Dutch flower stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first strain that you sold,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, probably a 32 line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty two.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Albuquerque manic line crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Albuquerque manic male crossed with a
sour cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think I sold any Albuquerque
BX ones, but, uh, sour cush, original
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel, uh, master cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you, are you pretty good about keeping
back stock of stuff and, and preserve
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like preserving your own lines and
holding back stock of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have everything.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have every seed of everything that's
ever been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have thousands of seeds of everything
that's ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to blow you for
something then.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I just, um, I just pop pretty much all
the old seeds that I have from 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all I have left is just seeds that
I've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Archive has very gassy turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other flavor profiles do you feel you
have dialed in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from gassy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's pretty much what I breathe for,
skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, every, every other
flavor out there, um, but has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your fastest finishing release?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the shark bite, but I don't think
I've put any of that in a while out in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get some strain history.
[SPEAKER_02]: History questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy keeps asking about Super Dave
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just a dude up here in the
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know a whole lot about him or
haven't seen a lot of his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to comment on shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I think the bland shit becomes
popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because people, because the whole
world is turning into a consumed by visual
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it looks good, it sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to buy it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even though the vast majority of
really, really tasty strains don't look
[SPEAKER_00]: the best because you're selecting for
terpenes and flavor, not for visual
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and when no one was taking pictures
of their bag a week, cause they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the best selling point was what it
smelled like when it opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you opened up a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we cover Albert Walker last time where
it originated from?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't think we did maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got it from my buddy, uh,
canvas Reverend up here and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: he, um, got it from this other kid who got
it from the old timer and that do live
[SPEAKER_00]: like an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, we were just, uh, buying the herb
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, canvas Reverend happened to get a cut
one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think he took it down to Oregon,
lost it, uh, and then reacquired it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this was like 2003, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, like 10 years later, the,
the guy that we got the cut from,
[SPEAKER_00]: he hit me or like, I guess it was like
2013 or yeah, like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hit me up as the medical scene started,
uh, coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I'm the one that gave that to
your buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he knew all the same people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was obviously him and we sat down
and had some beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he said that it came from a
electrician plumber dude that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I think it was in the Portland area or
like Vancouver, Washington, and he had
[SPEAKER_00]: moved out from Iowa or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when the old timer up here,
he, uh, got the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the clone when he got his
electricity and his plumbing done for his
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room, like, you know, 15,
20 or 20 years ago, like mid nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: late nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, that's where he had got it
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had another guy come up to me
at, uh, uh, Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that, uh, he was the one that
popped the seed in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was telling me that he had given it
to like three or four people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only grew it for like six months or a
year or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave it to a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, one of those guys moved to,
uh, to Vancouver, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stories kind of lined up and I
hadn't given him any information about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I knew about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he said that he had received the
seeds, uh, from the base player of
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reggae band and that he had popped
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he, but he didn't know what the
actual origin of the seeds were like with
[SPEAKER_02]: the baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was backseat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty fucked around though that it
came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I'm one of the very few
companies that's working with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is known for, for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, we entered it into
the, the, uh, can of Bible with Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: King.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, yeah, anyways, they,
uh, those guys, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the guy that we got it from,
I believe his story, cause he had nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: to gain from making anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the guy that came up,
it just happened to match up with the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty fucking rad, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it works out and you know,
Albert Walker is a pretty unique name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, it's easy to know if you,
you are or not what, what you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of fake Albert Walker going
around, uh, but I remember from San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was that eight cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: From when, uh, he got given it and it got
mixed up and then sold it with the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's the one that,
that, uh, that cuts equally also good,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose, because it's been winning stuff
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: The day go Walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just totally not Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other passion strains
besides the skunk or Terps besides the
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any, any like passion Terps that you're
passionate about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have my strawberry and blueberry
that I always seem to fucking navigate to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything besides the skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it just has to have a long
lasting after flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that typically tends to be the stuff
that's either really skunky or really
[SPEAKER_00]: insensy one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Need to put on my fucking old lady
glasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can fucking see the ape cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think apes doing stuff again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he seems to have his farm back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still talk to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still talk to him?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never talked to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never knew him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't give him the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from wick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fucking wick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking wick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get, I didn't give him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't give him anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said, bring back the 32 line,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, him and three other
people interested in all that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: History of Skywalker OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, million different stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're confusing the blueberry
mazar Skywalker with Skywalker OG.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the Jedi.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG was the blueberry one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earliest I ever heard about it was a
buddy of mine in Southern Oregon was a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to, the guy from, I remember this
because I used to, I took him actually my
[SPEAKER_00]: Omega gardens when I was done running them
because he wanted to run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to take all his herb down to
the guy that owns Calm and Malibu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they already had a like ghost OG on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just called it Skywalker OG
because the Star Wars film films were
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember it was like 2004,
2005 when the Star Wars films like re came
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, it was like good marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like the same reason with
the blue Ivy OG when Jay Z had his kid and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, they always do that in LA
whenever, when, when Whitney Houston died,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a Whitney Houston OG,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which cuts which and, you know,
and after that, then there actually became
[SPEAKER_00]: like a differentiated Skywalker OG club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That like went around LA and whether or
not that's an S1 or some, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since when have you been washing your own
genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know much about the A5 and C5?
[SPEAKER_02]: The males, the A5 haze and the C5 haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, but there's, there are females of
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, yeah, I don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, there was a good one just a
few seconds ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, your yields will only go up if you
wear socks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Socks and cocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Archive had them sour grapes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a sour grapes?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about bull rider?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you know about bull rider?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
Nothing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a real hard strain to track down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the original, I see Afghani bull
rider all the time, but not the original
[SPEAKER_02]: bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only bull rider I ever saw came from
Danimal and it had to be fake because it
[SPEAKER_00]: sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Danimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: South fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the, the purple indica last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go watch that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lineage on face off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also did last time, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the barbecue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Face off back seats from Casas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any old long lost varieties from your past
you wish were still around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's definitely some good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw much of it, but the freeze and
orange that was up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen buds of it that people say is it
since, but my buddies that I trust up
[SPEAKER_00]: here, they say it used to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this strain called coral reef
that was at, that was in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a spittles type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just weird, crazy, incredible,
different smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasted just like it smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else was gold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold was pretty good that reefer man had,
or something gold that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kodiak gold?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't, it wasn't the Alaskan one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Humboldt or Mendocino,
something gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could change one thing about Dosey
Dose, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good phenotypes in all of it,
but there's definitely some Hermes and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosey Dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you've ever grown OGKB,
it throws balls on the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It throws bananas out the tops and it'll
throw clusters inside the colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to reduce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To as little of an occurrence as possible
is like some of the hardest work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it didn't have that trait so I
didn't have to spend so much time trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get plenty of strong flavor in the Dosey
Dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the NorCal cut that goes around is
kind of a in-between for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a cut I keep personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one dude, Smellboat, had a fucking
killer cut of your Dosey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot better stuff in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown so many fucking seeds over the
last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been Hermes in almost every pack
of seeds I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that didn't ever have Hermes had
super schwag fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to deal with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when people are good growers,
they don't really focus so much on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to fucking Hermes and shit,
you just handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Schwag weed or no Hermes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't breed for everything all at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you are trying to do is reduce the
occurrences, but it doesn't matter if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about Chem 91, Chem 4,
OGKB, Cookie, Sherbert, Gelatos,
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stress the original mother plant,
it'll Herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to expect anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about the Amnesia cut you
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Amnesia Haze cut from
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people call it the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Super Lemon Haze also.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we ignoring the face off question or
just not seeing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we answered it in the last time me and
him did a live feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up on YouTube, Tyler.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many weeks should Sour D go?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: As many as you like it, where you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least 10.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever heard of Ultraviolet?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the very earliest you could get it
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever heard of Ultraviolet?
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was the purple indigo face off
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any collabs with other breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already collabing with me anyways
half the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, using your stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Works either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what else we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me some good strain history questions
you guys got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any strain that you want to run
the history on that you'd like to like
[SPEAKER_02]: that has some misinformation out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably pretty much everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's coming to mind right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shrom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbian Gold crossed with Federation
Seeds Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1972 Columbian Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Sur Holyweed history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of stories behind
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with any of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't have any first hand
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really only talk on the stuff that I was
actually there for or have first hand
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's so and so said so and so all I can
do is tell you what the story was like the
[SPEAKER_00]: monk from monk named Paul story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like every the same one everybody
else knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: PhDs did not make Shrom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fucking done made Shrom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to cross runt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that is that in your future runt stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite OG cut favorite OG Kush cut other
than face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the original cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know people weren't feminizing shit
back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they're not directly related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just take the oldest cut and
feminize it, you're going to get every
[SPEAKER_00]: other clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the story with Scott's OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him a bunch of clones and that's
what he made with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you thinking about collaborating with
Ethos any time soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even barely know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him like twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these questions kill me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is train wreck bread in a cardboard
box to get those cardboard chirps?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think train wreck smells like
cardboard, then you should just stop
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grew a train wreck and it smelled
like cardboard, you suck it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cure game is fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: This train wreck reeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Train wreck reeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Train wreck is a beautiful fucking strain,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Train wreck is a great strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it reeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: History of Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's easy enough to look up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Carney.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carney for Puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask him about Puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like GMO Terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just reminds me of an old hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not anything new.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever breed some stuff for yourself
that you don't release?
[SPEAKER_02]: Haystuff, old lines, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just choose one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a lot of Hawaiian stuff
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have my buddy from Hana that gave me
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lemon strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew that out, picked one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, what he used to call the Maui
rain smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a really hazy, like real
tropical, really cool smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just unique, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That my buddy's Hawaii Web Dendika Molokai
Frost Cross that I selected a pheno of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the new strain that I'm making
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did we pollinate recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still trying to work the walker into
something better than it, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old purple indica, same deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hunt through a lot of them to
find improvements, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite cut you have right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that'd be easy to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's why I have some many cuts,
is because I don't have a favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to admit, the Skittles, the way that
thing fucking smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I saw that, I thought the
smell was fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first time I smelled it was
at Sebastian's place in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He pulled some out of the freezer,
some fresh frozen, and opened it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the fuck did you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it did smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's special.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the only other thing I have smelled
that was that fake was some herb we bought
[SPEAKER_00]: from my buddy's dad and we were in high
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like dryer sheets, but it
didn't have dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't actual dryer sheet weed,
which was common back then also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some locally grown stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really like real perfumey smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think Skittles is just by
looking at it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably has a cherry pie-ish look to
it a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Fletch have any old Land Race
heirloom beans?
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a favorite old heirloom line
that you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: All that Hawaiian shit's pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Malawi Gold that I don't have anymore,
but the Malawi and El Haze cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Purple Indica is pretty old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff is the Millie is
either Land Race or Land Race hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very well-developed varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: History on Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there's been a few histories
going around.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your recollection of the actual
history?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know it came from Grow Hard Root
Boy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really ever have anything of it
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's back out too, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had some good questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any Highland tie available?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you work with Highland tie?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I had a tie that Chris gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we talked about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only real tie I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I grew a bunch of tie crosses,
the Durban Tie High Flyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other tie stuff did I trade?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried a bunch of Cambodian stuff from
Canada at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember any other tie stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tie stuff, I remember growing it and
it was just so swag most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like not much smell,
really hairy, not much resin and hermies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to find a good fucking tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had people send back bunches and
bunches and bunches and spend a lot of bad
[SPEAKER_02]: time on shitty tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hard to come across a good tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying tie is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just everything that I ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what people have to keep in
mind with every variety too is like you
[SPEAKER_00]: tried one version from one person that who
knows how reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like sometimes you got to go
through a bunch of shit to find what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shug TK, I still don't think that's
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think it's the Puss Kush that's
going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even found an old post from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember El Gato?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He even made a post where he's like this
Pure Kush that's going around,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the LA Pure, which is the OG
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, it's not the same as Shug's
Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the main purveyors of
passing out that cut 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that post was like from 2010 or 2012
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you get the name The Doctor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who chose it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I skateboarded when I was a kid,
I would get bloody all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ever break bones, so I'd bring
around gauze and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty rad, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just end up, I never broke bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my buddies have broke bones and we
have to go to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just end up bleeding everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got the right shit for it and
clean yourself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever heard of the PKG cut of OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Ghost One Pure Kush Rehab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone that the guy that it's named after
never had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be legit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how many people fucking tell me
I'm wrong about that too?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's painful nowadays to even try to
correct people or correct even just
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to correct them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to correct misinformation
from being spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you would think that the
misinformation 20 years ago would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been worse because the exchange of
information was really poor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are overflowed with so much
information that it's like finding a
[SPEAKER_00]: needle in the haystack, finding the real
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a pain in the fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's what PKG means.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Pure Kush goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I thought someone had remembered
seeing someone try to call it that and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, yeah, that's just that's even
dumber than calling it Ghost One Pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to bring out any more Bazooka
Joe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem, maybe, maybe that was a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good for out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good for outdoor and greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are Trinity and Humble Snow related?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, any?
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't smell related to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the snow is like that incensey kind
of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Trinity was that burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Sage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever found a good sage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never found a sage that's as good as
the Big Sur Holyweed cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Adam said he did say that Big
Sur Holyweed wasn't sage, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it smells like it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whether or not it's the same cut
or whatever, who knows, but it's it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely smells very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doseydo 18 Fresh Frozen Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever play land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as close as we can really get to it
nowadays, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the the dog shit is pretty close
to land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like when I have worked and grown pure
land races, like we're talking about with
[SPEAKER_00]: the like the ties, they're so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's it's too hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the purple indica is the same
thing, is the same issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so unhybridized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That any time you cross something into it,
you got to like search through a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred of them to find an improvement
because it's it likes those genes like to
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't understand what they're
getting into when they want like newer
[SPEAKER_02]: growers want to run land like real land
races, legit land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a lot of herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a lot of fucking
resinless shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've got to comb through it
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to hybridize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to work it for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody expects that, like just
because it's a land race, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more stable or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had the exact opposite experience
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're growing land races
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing people have to
keep in mind is like when people make
[SPEAKER_00]: selections outdoor or in different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if if you make your selections outdoor
in a greenhouse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant does not hermaphrodite at
all in those conditions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a true female or is that a
hermaphrodite if it hermies when you take
[SPEAKER_00]: it inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a true female or is it a hermy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you change the environment,
change the wavelength of the of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: source and everything else, if you may be
inducing the hermaphroditic tendencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in its natural environment,
which is outside under the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a clean female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so what is the sex of that individual?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it is it actually female or is it a
hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it hermies indoors, but not
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think you'd have to apply it to
outdoor status.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like because that's its natural
environment, everything needs to acclimate
[SPEAKER_02]: to some degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a big difference trying to
bring something indoor to outdoor or
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor to indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, every cannabis plant is outdoor to
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's been hybridized indoor,
it still carries the same genes of every
[SPEAKER_00]: other plant that grows outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, another thing people have to
keep in mind, like a thousand watt HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least historically, I don't know about
the DEs, but I know it's not that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not that considerably different.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand watt HPS bulb, six inches from
the bulb is one tenth of the strength of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun in like the middle of summer.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are selecting for a plant that
performs well indoors, essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: first criteria that you're unknowingly
selecting for is the plant's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn light into energy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a if if a plant does not
convert that super efficiently,
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't grow well indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it needs the intensity of the sun
to process the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if as soon as you go indoor with it,
you're already selecting away 90 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants that don't perform well
without a full light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you have lots of varieties
that when you take them outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually perform way better again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be kind of poor growers or kind
of weak stemmed or some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: mediocre growth pattern indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same plant outside's a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has nothing to do with like
quality genetics or anything other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's ability to process light and
how effective, how efficiently you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that and whether or not it could even do
it with a fraction of the light available
[SPEAKER_00]: in its natural and evolved environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acclimation is so fucking important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So important.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just it's just about whether or
not it can and they can convert that light
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't I don't do any breeding for
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't I don't take my plants out,
acclimate them outdoors, see how they
[SPEAKER_02]: perform outdoors, because I just don't
have outdoor space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's ideal, especially
because a lot of people during certain
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons are only buying for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the true O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush turf profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you best describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought it kind of smelled,
tasted like chlorine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get like soapy cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost smells like a pool and like salt
water and real like skunky type of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly that like the whole lemon pine
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really ever get that out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like kind of like that,
but only because like lemon and pine are
[SPEAKER_00]: also cleaner type smells as well.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I tend to think that a lot of
people pick up more lemon from O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: because they associate that with cleaner
and like lemon, pine, salt and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about cleaning clones with
ionized water?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mean, ionized water isn't
anything special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any real milk chocolate tasting
weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some old bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old
[SPEAKER_00]: purple indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidized weed tastes chocolatey in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think it was chocolate tie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't because it was fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Casper O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Ken's O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that crossed the face off line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it won't extract without ionized
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Blonde had a good question here
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blonde hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any opinions on MedUse or Wood Horse
Harijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any interactions with Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally, all my interactions with
him, he's been a dick, but I think he just
[SPEAKER_02]: he openly says he doesn't really like
Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my only interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be chasing down heroin
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I saw the best the best heroin I
ever saw was from the heroin O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: that used to go around L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if he's claiming that he
bred heroin, but heroin is a Steve Tuck
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which most people forget about that
guy, even though he had a big impact on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people forget where all the shit
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't that many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm surprised when people when
people talk about heroin, you never hear
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuck's name brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, even though he's super fucking
known for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 15 years ago, he was like the only
source for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they made it and called it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's that's the that's what
he says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't remember ever hearing it
other than with his name attached to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he still around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go on YouTube, he does strain
history videos that are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably some of the most grown,
grown worthy fucking strain history videos
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took credit for O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, him and 14 other people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best cross with Moonbow from the newest
drop, in your opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been liking the Moonbow 75 Fem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked to see you putting out fans,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a little easier to select your
pollen donor when you can actually smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the hardest part about
picking a male is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm picking one out of 300 females is
the one that I want to keep picking one
[SPEAKER_00]: out of 300 males and figuring that out
with just reversing it and picking for
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you still are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your odds are significantly decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 99 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many Josie F1 packs were released?
[SPEAKER_02]: Less than 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less than 20 packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank Giegak story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find that elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was the one that debunked that
whole thing being related to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I found I was the one that
found all his fucking old the where he got
[SPEAKER_00]: they ended up having him on that show and
they didn't ask him the one question that
[SPEAKER_00]: was most important of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was when they busted Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Frank like his brother is a
brother and some other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was three brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you read the news articles,
there was three brothers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between like 24 and 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those kids were supposedly brought in
because they knew how to grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they had experience growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever asked anything about those
three kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were from Lake Tahoe or somewhere
around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was this was in the news
articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they were describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are those three dudes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you really wanted to know,
it sounded like they were the ones growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to dinner with Christie right
before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to Frank on the phone and he
laughed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He laughed at the O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, dude, we're growing like how it
was like Big Bud, you know, for and
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, not possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he didn't he didn't really sound that
much into growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was more interested in telling his
bunker stories, but not about the growing
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were more interested in selling the
book, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a full fucking hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's gone just like that, just like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone, for coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if I didn't get your questions in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying, trying to keep the best
questions coming flowing as best I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff I knew that he wanted to answer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff I knew he had info about,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check you guys later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
