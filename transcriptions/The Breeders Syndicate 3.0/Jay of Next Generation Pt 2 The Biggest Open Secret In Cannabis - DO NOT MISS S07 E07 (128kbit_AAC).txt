[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_02]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: Notzodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We join this conversation already in
progress and it kind of ends abruptly too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tend to be on like meth head hours,
which sucks because like, you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to have that in common with them,
but at the same time, it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: realistically light hours are cheaper if
you're an indoor grower at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a lot of us live on vampire hours
and that's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're keeping moms, they don't get
to travel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after 10 PM, yeah, after 10 PM,
neighbors don't stop by randomly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's safe to go get in your girl room and
smell like weed and yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you mean it's, it's funny because,
you know, I would imagine from the outside
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've always kind of looked at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I wonder what my neighbors think
because like they see this, this young man
[SPEAKER_02]: who like barely ever leaves the house,
never leaves on trips, never, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and is up at all these odds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they must think of a tweaker and
that's just the only conclusion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, nowadays you can say you work online
and that's normal, but back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years ago, it's, uh, now we can use
that excuse back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hell assess 20 years ago.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm here with Jay from next generation
seeds, formerly of Federation seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who is with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my friend Casey, um, he's been
growing, uh, other than growing his own,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, death bubble for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been, uh, working with different LPs,
uh, big companies in Canada, doing a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of the paperwork and doing the
extractions, uh, for quite a few different
[SPEAKER_04]: LPs up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the guy I call, uh, when I need
to make bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love me some good bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to go over some bubble tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's one thing we have not covered
at all on this show is hash, hash bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hashtag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been, uh, that's one thing with
growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always have lots of, uh, samples of
different hashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, uh, yeah, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number that different grades.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually I have a box right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, random, uh, just, just every different
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could think of, uh, different samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go, let's go through and hear what
kind of strains that they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have over there in hash form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it gives us a good idea of what's
going on over in your territory as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: the strains currently that you're into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, uh, well, as you know, with,
with different types of hash, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: some are really good for, uh, for pressing
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some just like dump the resin or
just sticky right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some, no matter how good it is,
um, it just, it won't press.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll still always look kind of,
uh, golden, but it won't actually get
[SPEAKER_04]: slippery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it'll get like classy all every,
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, I'm really happy with one of the
strains I've done, uh, lately,
[SPEAKER_04]: my, uh, red truffles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's in this?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, uh, it's, uh, the truffle strain
crossed with the Columbia and red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and, uh, when you put that in your
hand and just, it just goes like a slick
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic with it within seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, it's an amazing, amazing strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've actually got a lot more of it
going on on the next round here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do some fresh frozen as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but when we can, um, yeah,
but 90% of my crop is usually done for
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's usually dry and all dry sieve,
but even the dry sieve just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some strains are pretty powdery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, like the grid God, even though it's
one of the sweetest ones, it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: get slick and slippery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, is that one more sandy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like a Sandy on the grid?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry Sandy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, uh, it's not like, uh, actually the
old sweet tooth was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter how great sweet tooth was and be
white and pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wouldn't stick together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, whereas the BC Kush would just melt in
your hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the sweet tooth was a lot nicer
tasting, but, uh, it didn't look as good
[SPEAKER_02]: for the uneducated buyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is wild how differently certain
strains will wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus in press versus others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, you know, um, for example,
there's the cookies and cream and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that has that same Sandy type of
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think of purples, like purple
punch, um, they have that same Sandy type
[SPEAKER_02]: of resin, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you said great God, I was thinking
of that, that, that super purpley type
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that similar to the purple punch
where it's just super Sandy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a larger resin heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recently got a new camera for doing
macro shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat to see, uh, all the different strains
and, uh, the size of the different heads
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and just, you know, before we had
these good cameras, uh, we just never,
[SPEAKER_04]: never, never got to see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, and it's kind of cool to be able
to Sandy versus the greasy rate is like
[SPEAKER_06]: your stock to head ratio and what you're
harvesting makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was talking with one of my buddies
and this is kind of a random tangent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it just, it just sort of hit me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was over in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, where was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in it's either Thailand or India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were talking about the land races
out there, how they don't have as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says they, the, the farmers were saying
that they look more resinous, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have as much heads per square
centimeter, square meters, square
[SPEAKER_02]: millimeter, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that reason, the quality has gone
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was their explanation for
why the quality has gone down so far in,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was in Milana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I was wondering, is there any,
does that even make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I don't know as, as a non-hash guy
or non-hash maker, is that something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big hash guy too, but I can tell
you what I see from my own strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, like, yeah, some of them have,
uh, much larger heads, um, and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, smaller stocks, but there's some
strains that they're almost all stocks,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, on the, on the tri combs and just tiny
little heads on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but Casey's the professional on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking for those big heads and
like fire in fire out, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the better, the quality you're
putting in when you're harvesting that low
[SPEAKER_06]: quality plant matter, you're going to get
other that automatically comes along with
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you only have a little bit of this
and a little bit of this, you're,
[SPEAKER_06]: what you get at the end is, isn't the
quality, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get a lot of this and clean a
little bit out of this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because like people,
people ask that about breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, uh, our, our FEMC seeds
better than reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that they're more potent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, is this hash better?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, literally you can
break it down to shit in, shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put in shit, you get shit,
you put in good quality and that is it,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's FEM seeds, whether it's
anything when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: good quality gets you good quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never noticed a difference between
quality between the regulars and FEMS.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, obviously I do my breeding with
the regulars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, FEMS are just to grow out for people
to grow, but, uh, you know, but there is
[SPEAKER_04]: some breeders out there who, I don't know
if they just don't know any better or,
[SPEAKER_04]: or they don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is that, that actually breed with
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I'm, I'm still, I may,
maybe it's bro science or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, uh, still breed with, uh,
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, everything's gotta be selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: All my moms are selected from regulars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the, um, the clone onlys in
today's California market, or not even
[SPEAKER_02]: California's, uh, the U S market,
all of the clone onlys.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact were found via feminized or bag
seeds or, you know, like accidents,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's sour OG, any of the cookie
stuff, anything modern at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: all came from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's just one of those things
that over time, I think that was
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely a way that people thought at
the beginning was like, yeah, I use rags
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed because at least, you know,
you get that extra chromosome and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're not bringing up the
female chromosome, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over time we realized, Oh,
there's just, it's just that that
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosome is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's a different, it's autosomes
taking course over, um, sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just kind of where it's fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it, there's not really any,
it's the same kind of thing, shit in,
[SPEAKER_02]: shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a plant that naturally herms a
lot and will constantly kick herms of
[SPEAKER_02]: itself, it's probably going to breed a lot
of herms into its, and intersects into its
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's something that happens just
very rarely, an errant one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's, it's a lot easier to breed with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can do anything that shows any
herms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to just toss right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, um, but there is a few strains here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there that maybe spit out a little
banana at the end, um, that you keep,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I really don't have any, I have one
different phenol of a purple pine berry
[SPEAKER_04]: that I don't really sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, but yeah, it, uh, the last week
or so it puts a little banana,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're always sterile, but the buds
are so beautiful and big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's, it's hard for me to toss that
mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: See as a seed maker, it's hard,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like we see all these other
qualities that are in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they have nothing to do with their sex
traits, sexual traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they can have the most amazing resin
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to, we want to carry that trade
on, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we want to use that, but we know that
if people buy those seeds and they find
[SPEAKER_02]: that intersex trait, they may not have
that same like compassion for intersex
[SPEAKER_02]: traits that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just can't work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just cannot have it in our rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's, uh, as a seed company,
you can't be selling people things that,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, go herm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's a lot, there's a lot of
newbies out there and, uh, and they
[SPEAKER_04]: usually fuck up on a few different things
here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, uh, that's what something I really
haven't had much of a problem with,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, as far as hermaphrodites or mutants,
um, uh, even with, I make my feminized
[SPEAKER_04]: with STS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, yeah, I had no problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people say, like with the,
uh, with the other, uh, methods of making
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, sometimes there's a few Hermes or
they're not a hundred percent female with
[SPEAKER_04]: my formula on of the STS I've had,
I've had no, basically no issues for about
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you're going with a lot of really,
really stable stock as far as like
[SPEAKER_02]: uniformity, because they're lines you've
worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when I noticed a lot of the intersex
issues pop up is when it's newer lines
[SPEAKER_02]: that are unworked, like, you know,
doing a, a hybrid between two brand new
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy poly hybrids, like animal mints
cross to, I don't know, cherry truffle,
[SPEAKER_02]: but whole, you know, like you could,
you cross those two, then there's like all
[SPEAKER_02]: this parentage below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these possibilities of plasticity
come out and intersex traits are bound,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like that's the way I look at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're, if you, if you've worked
lines already worked out those intersex
[SPEAKER_02]: traits and you're feminizing yourself,
then they're going to be pretty fricking
[SPEAKER_02]: stable and they're going to have a lot
less venous popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be more true to what people
want from that product, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they expect when they go to your
site.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a lot of my strains are,
uh, I've been working with for 25 years
[SPEAKER_04]: and I haven't read them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looked at anything else, but obviously
here and there I bring in new,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, like the red truffles I brought in
because it was just so impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, I bring in new stuff here
and there, but it has to pass,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, a few tests to get into the,
uh, yeah, into my, my mother room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of, what kind of tests are
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like talk about some of your, um,
qualifications for bringing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um, basically it's got a,
well, as we said last time on the show,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, uh, flavors and the number one thing
for me, um, the terpene levels,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, it's got a taste really, really good
from start to finish on that joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's number one for me before plant
structure, before anything, it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes and the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, that's right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one of the ones, uh,
I've been really pleased with is our blue
[SPEAKER_04]: dynamite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I brought, I brought that back way
back in 2007.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all over high times and,
uh, I won a few awards with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, I just recently brought it
back and, uh, we grew out a big batch of
[SPEAKER_04]: it and, uh, I selected five different
phenols that, that I wanted to,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, rejuvenate and pass the cones around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after I grow out the seedlings,
um, I picked my favorites, rejuvenate
[SPEAKER_04]: them, and then try them as a clone before
I make my final selection and try the
[SPEAKER_04]: samples of each one, send them in for some
tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, back in the day, we, we weren't able
to send them in for tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't exist, but now nowadays,
uh, nowadays we get to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before the numbers comes to flavor,
um, I, you know, sometimes I don't care if
[SPEAKER_04]: it's only 20% and not 24.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, usually don't notice me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, yeah, if the terpenes are
high, you don't notice those lower
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, people, uh, people drink wine and
not, uh, ever clear for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not always about how the number is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's about how you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, like when it comes to smoking,
taking the edge off is like 99% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I want to do is take the edge
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be a cross-eyed and
confused and walking into walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be able to function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are times when that's very
appropriate, you know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other times, what's the time I have to
run a company and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, yeah, I have some of that
view dynamite here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know if you can tell on the
camera, but man, this, the latest batch,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cross I have now, it's a really good
outdoor strain, but purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can tell that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't quite see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just had, um, we had a big
breeder's meetup about, I think two months
[SPEAKER_02]: ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the strains that came in was
blue dynamite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone actually grew a big, like really
nice outdoor batch of blue dynamite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, it was very grapefruit dominant,
super, super pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crossed the original very fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, you know,
it's great fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I won't get too baked, but I mean,
I was baked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did a damn good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, I don't smoke a lot of
outdoor because I've always been an indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: grower and there's not a big outdoor scene
where we're at in Bakersfield because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: so hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody grows outdoor that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I don't get to try outdoor often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't, I wasn't expecting to be
floored, but it was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was decent stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of our strains people, uh,
people tend to really like our strains for
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because, uh, because a lot of the
hardiness we have from, uh, the molds,
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance on the West coast, um,
Vancouver Island, it is raining all the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the first 10, 12 years of my,
my breeding career was all on the island
[SPEAKER_04]: or it's, everything's just, the humidity
is through the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, yeah, mold resistance is something
I always, you know, sometimes my accident,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's something you select for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mendo growers love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of East coast growers
lately that hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I've been telling them is
just like, dude, you like everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that I know in Mendo that is in
like more humid situations, they all grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: they grow next gen seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they all do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been, I've been recommending that
for East coast growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, man, my, my situation is so
humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, well, I got, you know,
this is a great solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that have bred in this kind of
climate, uh, great strains, good quality
[SPEAKER_02]: strains for this climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what people need to be thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, I wish people would think more about
that as opposed to what's hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: What will work good for me and my area?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would solve a lot for a lot
of people and their issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've noticed that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a lot of feedback in the last
few years here, um, uh, for outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: growers, uh, even with, with our auto
flowers, but also with our, some of our
[SPEAKER_04]: other outdoor varieties like the Avalon,
blue dynamite, time warp, um, strings are,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're, we're bred on the, on the West
coast, uh, uh, tend to be way,
[SPEAKER_04]: way better for mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can finish them in those hills.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A colleague of mine, uh, Ron Harrington
with, uh, golden hat seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's originally from Oregon state and it's
very rainy and humid bear, just like it is
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and he, uh, he breeds a few auto
flowers as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and last year on his farm,
he did a bunch of, uh, his own varieties,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and my grapefruit haze and my dynamite
alongside ethos seeds, a few auto flowers
[SPEAKER_04]: from them and a few other American
companies, uh, that aren't from a human
[SPEAKER_04]: climate and all of the, uh, all the
American strains molded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mine, mine was sit, my grapefruit haze
was sitting in the middle of a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: moldy buds and all mine, not except not a
drop of butrytis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a pretty wet year last,
uh, last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, that's what one thing that
people don't realize if you're on,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, if you're growing outdoors or on the
East coast, a lot of especially,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, they'd really like the, uh,
the more moldy stuff because they get more
[SPEAKER_04]: rain than you guys do down in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's next generation working on
currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where, where are you guys at?
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what, other than the, the red
truffles, what, what are some of your
[SPEAKER_02]: directions you're wanting to take the
company?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got my, my Avalon strain,
which is the tough, hardy outdoor strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we've got some CBD in it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've, we've crossed it out to a Spanish,
uh, CBD strain that I crossed it with in
[SPEAKER_04]: and I did a few back crosses now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a good Avalon CBD is about 20%
THC and about 4% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Avalon, um, one of the more grapefruity
ones?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's originally is the very first strain I
ever bred back in, uh, was it 1996,
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, it's a, it's an Afghani hash
plant crossed with a blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash plant blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but years and years of selective,
uh, breeding outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did all my selections outdoors on the
West coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so it became really, really hardy,
uh, finishes about the end of September.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you can put up with a lot of wind
and a lot of rain and just add like some
[SPEAKER_04]: strain, uh, we've got a big windstorm
that's laying over, but the Avalon's stand
[SPEAKER_04]: up straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put up with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bet it's that hardy breeding dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, and the other one, uh,
while we're actually working on,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, our first contact strain, we've got
to, I'm doing a big phenol hunt on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a one, the mother is a one to
one, uh, CBD THC strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I've out crossed that now to,
uh, my Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're testing that out right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a catalog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that one called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, first contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: First contact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of recommend that to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beginner smokers because it's lower,
a little bit lower THC, but this,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the CBD is really high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the terpene levels on that strain
are, are through the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's just really, really stinky and
branchy and branches out like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a give and take a little bit
when it comes to quality and in terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's almost a little bit of a
give and take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare that you see something in
the high, high testing range with high,
[SPEAKER_02]: high, high terpene percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I noticed that with my grapefruit
diesel, uh, strain, which is the highest
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene levels I've ever recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just over 5%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which is extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's extremely high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the THC level is only like 16 or
17.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: On, but it's, it's still my favorite to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody smokes it and just loves it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, you're tasting that flavor
right down to the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the, so, and everything I cross it
with tends to have about two and a half,
[SPEAKER_04]: 3%, uh, terpene level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been playing with that quite a
bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of terms is it coming out with
mostly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know what I can, honestly,
I can't really say, honestly, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, I don't, I don't remember a new
selection for a new mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't sent that one in for testing
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rarely get to do testing just because
I'm so cheap that I just don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but I get customers that aren't as
cheap as me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every once in a while you get those,
those, those cool customers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get a lot of feedback too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause, uh, over the last few years,
we've been selling a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds to some of the big LPs here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and they need, they do, do the tests
on it and they give us the feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's amazing to be able to get
that much feedback back, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, it's always, it's always neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to listen to all the customers
getting back to us after they grow out a
[SPEAKER_04]: crop and, you know, the good reports,
the bad reports, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got to hear it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, generally they're pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I hear a lot about LPs in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've had a few guests on in the past,
like our last guest, Pete has talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: LPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of explain for us Americans
what an LP even is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just a company, a cannabis company
or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well in Canada, we have several different
types of licenses that are highly
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled by the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the LP it's a licensed producer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I believe producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the micro growers for the
people who are smaller, like they have a
[SPEAKER_04]: small medium sized warehouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the nursery license where
you're only allowed to sell seeds or
[SPEAKER_04]: clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're all highly, highly regulated
by the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically can tell you more about that,
but, uh, the LPs are allowed, it basically
[SPEAKER_04]: covers the whole gamut of being able to
package it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a micro grower or a nursery
person has to go to, go to another company
[SPEAKER_04]: to package it for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they're just fixing all that now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when it, when it first started,
you had as a micro, you had to go to an LP
[SPEAKER_06]: or you had to get a processing license and
now you can get a sales license.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have your own path to sales,
but originally you'd have to go through an
[SPEAKER_06]: LP, which would have all the licenses to
be able to get you to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're slowly fixing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that blew my mind that I
found out about Canadian, um, maybe this
[SPEAKER_02]: is just territorial.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, but was that the people who
were in charge of buying for the
[SPEAKER_02]: government are like just randoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not weed people at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at every, every province or state,
as you guys call it, uh, is different and
[SPEAKER_04]: different regulations in every province.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, if I was, that's one reason
I, we still haven't gone for our full
[SPEAKER_04]: license here in Canada is, uh,
if we went for our full nursery license to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell seeds and clones on the legal market,
we would be prevented from, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: selling on our website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we wouldn't be, we wouldn't be allowed
to sell overseas, which is the majority of
[SPEAKER_04]: our market is, is overseas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so for us, uh, so right now I'm
growing for medical, uh, a few patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that allows me to do my selecting
and breeding and then provide the medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: for the patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, but the full legal market for us
isn't really, it's not, not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, we're looking for perhaps
eventually here getting, uh, moving out of
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, I've already got a location down
in South America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I started reading at, um, but we've
even considered, uh, working in the
[SPEAKER_04]: States.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, but do you guys have the same
thing too?
[SPEAKER_04]: Same problem where every state is
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: California is a nightmare, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, the way, the way that I think
that it's going to wrap up is to where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not going to be any path for
anyone to breathe because there's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be any kind of plant count that
allows you to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not nothing realistic,
like 12, you may get 12, but for a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company, it's what we piss on 12,
you know, like for one mom to stay alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need 12, you know, like that's not
realistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, uh, two licenses here for,
uh, 317 plants to license.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just about 635 plants we can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so that's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just, that's just enough for me to
work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never enough, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never enough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, well someday, someday maybe in
South America, we're looking, we're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at a license in Argentina where
they, when you get a license, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: they just allow you a flat, uh,
two acres, uh, do whatever you want on two
[SPEAKER_04]: acres, uh, whether it's indoor,
outdoor green house, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's simplified, but, uh, but there's
other, there's other steps they have there
[SPEAKER_04]: too, that are, that are quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they, do they have like a good power
grid to where, no matter where you're at,
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter where you live in Argentina,
you can just hook up like a fucking big
[SPEAKER_02]: old indoor and blow it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, it's pretty good actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty, uh, well set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the electricity cost is about the same
as Canada, probably a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive than the U S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, you know, there's no snow
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, uh, as Canadians, we like,
uh, we like not having snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys stick a snow up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a, he's ice fisherman himself lives
in the woods, but, uh, for, for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely hate the snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, here it gets up to like 120
degrees Fahrenheit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I hate the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could deal with the snow because I can
put on clothes, but I can't get more
[SPEAKER_02]: naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather be in shorts and shirtless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking, cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a good Canadian, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of Canadian are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to love snow and hockey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about a little bit about the
LP structures and stuff, because I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I, that is something we've never really
covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's say you want to run a big seed
company up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of license would you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just hypothetically though,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a nursery license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like the warehouse that we're in,
I mean, right now I'm working in,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, we're about 90% of the way to be
having it built for a nursery license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, we, we put a stop to that a few
months ago when we realized that,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the market isn't here in Canada,
um, for us, um, it just didn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're probably going to have something
changes in the next few months.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably going to wind down,
uh, operations here in Canada and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, uh, move overseas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just the regulations are just way,
way too tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, like if the government,
uh, employee who selects the products to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell in the stores says, uh, nobody buys
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't want your seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't sell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's insane to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, this person who has no tap on
the market at all says today we don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's your main strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, what, what, what's your
input?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your context for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the province we're in here now in
Alberta, I believe it's, uh, a few years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago, they took a bunch of season from some
micro growers and LPs and they didn't sell
[SPEAKER_04]: very well in the strain because basically
everybody had like one or two strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all white widow or a big bud or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and then they, the government
said, well, these aren't selling very
[SPEAKER_04]: well, so we're not going to buy seeds
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's saturated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the market has it's saturated too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so do you think, um, so just from my
perspective as an American, I noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: right at the beginning of COVID,
um, was when the drop happened as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: the market in the U S like that's when the
weed market just bottomed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may not have been, it might be
like, it might've just been a correlation
[SPEAKER_02]: causation type thing where it happened at
the same time, but whatever happened
[SPEAKER_02]: happened here at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was a very good mark to know
when the weed market completely bottomed
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it affected the seed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affected the seed market maybe six
months after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it hit around the same time there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty similar for the weed market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legal recreation kept doing kind of its
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it might've picked up a little
bit, but I would say like on the flower
[SPEAKER_06]: side on the gray, it would be down sales
for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the black market here, uh,
prices on the street dropped from about
[SPEAKER_04]: 12, $1,400 a pound down to about five or
six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and for five or $600, that barely pays
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not so high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of the, a lot of the,
uh, there was a lot of stuff going out the
[SPEAKER_04]: back doors of the LPs and the micros that
like how it always is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, but now these days, the
customers, the customers in Canada have
[SPEAKER_04]: slowly just moved, they're lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go to the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a store on every corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And only the, the good growers and the
guys that are really weed geeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're the ones still buying seeds,
but there's not as many of, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: guys that are just kind of doing it for
fun to make a little extra money on the
[SPEAKER_04]: side.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of used grow equipment for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two pallets of lights here that I
can't even give away.
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,000 watt HPSs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got about 45 of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even give them away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How quickly it flipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like on its head and then
flipped all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the seed market bottomed out as
far as I can tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the seed market too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the seed market for us, it's mostly
been maybe in the last six months to a
[SPEAKER_04]: year is where we really noticed the big
change because we sell a lot of wholesale
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people want to buy whether it's 100
seeds or 1,000 or 10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our wholesale prices have just dropped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's crazy how much has dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyone who hasn't dropped their price
per pack during this is silly because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're probably cutting themselves off
because the way I looked at it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds are not everybody needs seeds that
are growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that they do extra when
they have extra space to select,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to find something new, but they can
go get clones down at the grow store for
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 a pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would they need seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something they necessarily need
to select because they're selling new
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can go get what's hot, what's hip
from clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems to be what happened when
everybody's money kind of vanished in the
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: with COVID and everything else going on
and the weed market bottoming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but seeds weren't so necessary anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, you guys down in California,
I believe you can sell and buy and sell
[SPEAKER_04]: clones in stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can't do that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I take that back because for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we were able to, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: When 64 hit, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of screwed everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last I saw here locally,
they were not allowed to sell clones
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, but a lot of places do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one of those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're starting to now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see there's some stores that have
setups to actually house clones to be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to move them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think through the medical
market as well, companies can sell clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clones to medical patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's the logistic side of it,
right, depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough to send clones through the mail
and exactly depending on what you're
[SPEAKER_06]: getting.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who you're getting it from,
because you just don't even know if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be what you expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, if government regulations all
up in the middle of it, that really fucks
[SPEAKER_02]: you up like super because they really
don't know what the fuck they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no place in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm random.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck does that have to do with
anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the people that made the regulations
were not they were not pot smokers or
[SPEAKER_04]: growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bunch of bureaucrats, it seems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they wanted to treat it like Oscar
Meyer Ham or anything else like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really understand weed
customers like weed customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like somebody who drinks beer
every day and they go Budweiser,
[SPEAKER_04]: Budweiser, Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed smokers want to try something new all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes they have their their
reliable go to strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they want to try new flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not like I like the alcohol
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how it was really viewed up
here for a lot of regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just seen it as like like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way they viewed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how they try to treat it here,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's that's one of the big
issues that they've run into with,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, even driving, trying to,
you know, figure out how to screw people
[SPEAKER_02]: over and give them BWIs for smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're having problems with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you figure that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got some buddies like him that I
wouldn't trust them if they weren't
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking and driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me it makes me a lot cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't get all worked up about,
you know, other drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little less road rage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned to chill out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to like as a young man,
but I didn't used to smoke and drive a
[SPEAKER_02]: punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get all rowdy about like how fast I
was getting places and like, get out of my
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's just like, just chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with other people that have to get
there when I get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like, what are you so worked up
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't I don't smoke as much as I
used to when I was young.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, a long road trip always needs a
few puffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's something that you've smoked
recently that like not necessarily out of
[SPEAKER_02]: your own stuff, but that you've tried
recently that really was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, that's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's a unique strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has there been anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in a bit of a closet here,
a big closet with lots of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so here in Canada, I'm smoking most of
my own strains always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in South America, I tried to really
interesting strains down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what kind of strains you try down
there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, I quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met a really good grower in Chile.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were kind of working.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's growing out a bunch of my stuff right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he had a lot of different Jamaican
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really, really like a few different
Blue Mountain Sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also he had a it was interesting
because he also has a Colombian red down
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I and I grow Colombian red up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in the past and I'm breeding
with it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was it was nice to see that his was
very, very similar to mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the other side of the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a bit of a confirmation that
I'm getting a bit of the real deal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long flowering is that Colombian red?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got to be about 12.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have a cross with it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Colombian red cross with a
Mexican sativa that I'm calling Latina
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that went about 13, 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it probably could have went more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it could have kept going.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't like done, done like the rest of
the room, the rest of the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I was down in Argentina,
Casey here was watching the crowd for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: taking care of things and some of the
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Jay, I can't keep these alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, well, they're 13, 14 weeks old.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's why you can't keep them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I grow seeds and reap the
seeds, I grow that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So long until it until it almost dies on
the stick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the best quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I fertilize to the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he thought he was doing something
wrong here for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, look at the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put those in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those Colombians go 26 weeks,
every bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there are some jungly Colombians out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm a big fan of the sativa now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guys like to crush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like the sativa myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like ties and very clear headed type
eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it's just different,
different smoke for different occasions
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my buddies told me to tell you if
you do want this celestial temple sativa,
[SPEAKER_02]: the old, older release, he hasn't for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He I don't know if it's him or somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on my list.
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk about here, but, uh, we had
somebody contact us about two weeks ago
[SPEAKER_04]: saying he has, he, uh, he watched the
podcast and he has the celestial temple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent, he's, uh, it's in the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to send them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We told them anything you want,
man, pick, pick whatever you want from the
[SPEAKER_04]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys, so, uh, yeah, I can't wait
to try out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was such a nice, very unique strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen anything like it with those
long, long fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was just, it was actually,
uh, uh, a buddy, a mutual friend of a
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder, Steve and, uh, red, uh,
burnt down.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go back in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll know who burnt down is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he got, he had it sitting in the
corner of his living room for like two or
[SPEAKER_04]: three years as a house plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he always like, oh, he kind of ignored
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it was just, it stayed in veg,
just sitting in the corner of the living
[SPEAKER_04]: room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we took some cuts of it, brought it
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had never even grown it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think breeder Steve, uh, had,
had given them this cut and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: just sat there for years and years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and it, the story is it's from
Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but whatever you did with it,
it was hard to get it to flip into flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was at their edge forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that took about 12,
13 weeks to flower as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the high from that, I remember the
high from that, it's kind of like a,
[SPEAKER_04]: a really, a soapy spicy perfume.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was kind of like some of my
Jamaican strains I grew up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It left me always kind of confused
feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those strains that you don't
dare do math.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, some of that stuff, you have to
like put your light hours down to eight or
[SPEAKER_02]: nine hours to get it to trigger into
flower and initiate and just leave it at
[SPEAKER_02]: eight or nine hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're growing anything else that
like wants, you know, normal light hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a screw, because it's so much easier
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gotta go to flower with whatever that
that one wants but though some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: have the most quality wild special highs
and that's what makes them worth it that
[SPEAKER_02]: little weird chance you know that's yeah
there's uh people don't grow enough
[SPEAKER_04]: sativas up here I agree there should be a
lot more of them going around um but
[SPEAKER_06]: that's really cool in the yard too and get
the great big sativas friends that grow
[SPEAKER_04]: them and they're it's awesome but up here
in Canada outdoors we can't really finish
[SPEAKER_04]: them properly other than a few of the
early sativas and a few of the strains
[SPEAKER_04]: from um Great White North and yeah
Canadian Red Seeds they did the uh yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: they did some early sativa was basically a
Durban yeah yeah from Manitoba and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like that um yeah there's a lot of good
breed actually this brings me to the point
[SPEAKER_04]: uh when you had a peak there on the other
day yeah yeah let's talk about some of
[SPEAKER_04]: that he was bringing up a few things about
how uh but bc bud and how all the big
[SPEAKER_04]: players in bc back in the day or maybe
even now but back in the day anyway they
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't from bc yeah we all migrated from
out east uh we always heard about okay you
[SPEAKER_04]: can grow weed in bc and not go to jail for
too long so we all kind of migrate and the
[SPEAKER_04]: weather was better so we all kind of
migrated when I was 20 years old the first
[SPEAKER_04]: thing I did me and my wife we jumped and
moved to the coast um and learned how to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow weed that was but but most of Canada
a lot of the biggest breeders and players
[SPEAKER_04]: in the game were not from bc um yeah we
moved advantage of legal uh climate and uh
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I think if I all kind seed they're
all a bunch of Alberta boys um Mark Emory
[SPEAKER_04]: is from Ontario a whole bunch of really
top top grade breeders from Ontario from
[SPEAKER_04]: Manitoba which nobody talks about there
because you could go to jail for 20 years
[SPEAKER_04]: for growing plants so there's a bunch of
the big breeders from rural Manitoba um
[SPEAKER_04]: even a bubble man uh Richard uh what's his
name uh Mark uh Mark Mark Anderson bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: man yeah yes yeah Mark yeah he's from
Manitoba as well and uh yeah we're and is
[SPEAKER_04]: the Kootenays really big too yes yeah so
yeah a lot of the Kootenays where they'll
[SPEAKER_04]: have a generational growers that'll been
yeah their parents grew and their granddad
[SPEAKER_04]: grew um like our humble yeah yeah yeah
kind of and Vancouver island is is similar
[SPEAKER_04]: to that yeah yeah where I like the mighty
might boys there they were like their
[SPEAKER_04]: parents their grandparents are all grew uh
they were uh I think Vietnam or uh uh
[SPEAKER_04]: draft dodgers from yeah they leave uh the
states when they got drafted so they all
[SPEAKER_04]: came up to Canada and so it's generation
after generation of growers um but yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: that's mostly the island and uh the
Kootenays um yeah so yeah um yeah a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of good strains but uh like when I
moved out there I to BC uh I uh I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: realize that a lot of my friends were lazy
hippies and uh they didn't keep they
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't keep uh mother plants around
because they could just go to talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody else and buy a tray of clones for
the next grill and and for me being from
[SPEAKER_04]: the the prairies where it was all rare I
was just a rabid collector and I just got
[SPEAKER_04]: everything I could get my hands on my my
bedrooms were bigger than my flower rooms
[SPEAKER_04]: after time oh same same always yeah yeah
um always and they didn't they grew up
[SPEAKER_04]: with it was I was there so they kind of
didn't take it seriously so that that's
[SPEAKER_04]: why I think a lot of uh us easterners um
kind of came in and took over the market
[SPEAKER_04]: um yeah and even even when the prairie
boys or the east coast guys uh had weed to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell to the states they just called it bc
bud or beasters yeah um because you would
[SPEAKER_04]: never tell anybody that you're actually
growing it it's like oh yeah I bought it
[SPEAKER_04]: from a guy in BC like that makes sense you
wouldn't you wouldn't even tell your best
[SPEAKER_04]: friend that you were growing in your
basement um yeah yeah that's how that's
[SPEAKER_04]: how secretive it was back in the 90s so
yeah yeah it's still that way here where
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at like you just I'm all even all my
friends know like oh we don't know where
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt lives that's what it is it just you
know they just know that's part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: drill you know yeah it's it's it's an old
school mentality and I don't think it it's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not even necessary as much
anymore but like back then it was that you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to end up on anyone's short
list when someone's grow got robbed you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to do that so it was like you
didn't even want to ask someone where they
[SPEAKER_02]: lived if you knew they were a grower and
if you're a grower you didn't want to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it because you don't want to get
ripped or robbed or yeah you need to know
[SPEAKER_04]: only only need to know yeah and anybody
who is going a buddy who is going through
[SPEAKER_04]: a divorce or split up with a girlfriend
you was like okay bud no offense but I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to talk to you for a year yeah
yeah things go over because one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: most dangerous things was uh was when
somebody split up um yeah and vindictive
[SPEAKER_04]: uh ex-girlfriend would just fucking rack
you up um my chick my chick has been mind
[SPEAKER_02]: blown like she went to that party um in
the in the mountains with a bunch of us
[SPEAKER_02]: that all met up around the country and she
was the one story she heard in common was
[SPEAKER_02]: that we all have exes that have
blackmailed us over weed like that is just
[SPEAKER_02]: a part of our life we all have been
blackmailed over growing yeah you got two
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that can uh confirm that here right
like it's just it's i don't how do we how
[SPEAKER_02]: do they even know to do that like is there
a rule book somewhere it says hey find a
[SPEAKER_06]: grower and blackmail them you know lived
happily on it for years and so it goes
[SPEAKER_04]: away fuck you yeah you got kids even worse
even worse yeah yeah we both been there
[SPEAKER_04]: man jesus yeah that's one thing actually i
liked about uh when i moved over to spain
[SPEAKER_04]: um it was so reading for me to uh be able
to uh oh how do you welcome aboard yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: living in living in spain i was able to uh
live openly and free i didn't have like
[SPEAKER_04]: vancouver island we had one or a couple
friends that actually knew where we lived
[SPEAKER_04]: and nobody else really knew where i lived
even even though they were close friends
[SPEAKER_04]: um sure but in spain nobody gave a shit
like everybody was growing you never had
[SPEAKER_04]: to hide it i mean like i said the first
tray of clones i sold in spain was to the
[SPEAKER_04]: local police officer um that is so crazy
it was it was a it was a non-issue didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: have to hike what year or two to your crop
yeah what year were you in spain i believe
[SPEAKER_04]: i went there in 2008 okay uh the week that
mark emery got busted he went there during
[SPEAKER_04]: the glory days for spain yes exactly
that's why i know a bunch of the big
[SPEAKER_04]: players in spain yeah all the big farmers
for for all the big farmers for dinefm
[SPEAKER_04]: royal queen all those guys limota yeah yep
uh so yeah i was there 2008 until 2016 i
[SPEAKER_04]: believe no shit 16 or 17 so yeah nine nine
years living there so let's let's break
[SPEAKER_02]: into something i i know i've mentioned it
on the show before but it's something that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very often not talked about it's one
of those golden rules to see things that
[SPEAKER_02]: like the guys involved don't want people
talking about it but it's a reality can
[SPEAKER_02]: you talk about some of the big players in
spain who are making the majority of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds for the seed industry is that
something you're open to talk about um
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah it's uh it's it's an open secret um
anybody that's yeah close to it there's
[SPEAKER_04]: probably only a couple dozen big farmers
that provide seeds for all the big
[SPEAKER_04]: companies most of the spanish companies
well originally the dutch were the big
[SPEAKER_04]: companies um and then they started farming
out seed making to spanish growers because
[SPEAKER_04]: everything was cheaper in spain and it
became more illegal in amsterdam they
[SPEAKER_04]: cracked down on them yeah you can and yeah
the dutch guys were getting older too
[SPEAKER_04]: they've been doing it for 20 years and
they wanted to retire yeah getting older
[SPEAKER_04]: so they they bring their clones down to a
spanish farmer and give you the clones so
[SPEAKER_04]: hey you make these seeds i'll give you 50
cents a seed and uh i was i was uh
[SPEAKER_04]: probably propositioned by a few different
growers too from paradise and it's serious
[SPEAKER_04]: to make seeds for them um i never did it
maybe i should have but uh but yeah i know
[SPEAKER_04]: i should after the first after the first
five or six years or ten years of uh the
[SPEAKER_04]: spanish guys uh farming the seeds they're
like wow forget these dutch guys and the
[SPEAKER_04]: spanish slowly took over the market uh and
they stepped up to so but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: companies down there there's a few that
are that are breeding their own things and
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't just retailers but the majority of
the spanish companies they buy it off a
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer and you know three or four
different seed companies will have the
[SPEAKER_04]: exact same bag of seeds but all have a
name that's similar yeah and and what i
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed what i noticed was a lot of it
started with like okay the the dutch would
[SPEAKER_02]: bring like the drunkers would bring their
clones down there they'd sell you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed lines would be true to what they were
selling at the time but then like over
[SPEAKER_02]: time i noticed like greenhouse like you'd
never consistently get the same seeds in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same pack because they were just like
give us something like jack harrow like
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll think you know is it lemony a
little bit lemon haze all right is it
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa lemon you know and it started to
get a lot more like that and and i think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably one of the most open secrets
behind the scenes but on the front side
[SPEAKER_02]: most people don't know that they're buying
from like 12 breeders in spain when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're buying these large large companies
like the major i don't even need to name
[SPEAKER_04]: them but yeah the large company yeah we
don't need to name them because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: obvious if you look at the catalogs
everybody's got a critical cross or a
[SPEAKER_04]: silver haze or amnesia something yeah yeah
they're all they all come from the same
[SPEAKER_04]: bag half the time yeah but yeah and a lot
of the auto flowers too they uh the
[SPEAKER_04]: spanish are really big on the autos um
they did some great breeding on autos
[SPEAKER_04]: they're really good breeding like they
they made the autos uh a good thing
[SPEAKER_04]: because yeah when auto flowers first came
onto the scene they were shit yes they
[SPEAKER_04]: were tiny little runs um it was kind of a
novelty uh at the beginning yeah and that
[SPEAKER_04]: actually that a lot of the first breeders
of the auto flowers actually were from
[SPEAKER_04]: canada as well out in toronto uh region i
don't know know them myself personally um
[SPEAKER_04]: uh-huh but i think a lot of the first auto
flowers that were marketed um like a
[SPEAKER_04]: little rider yeah yeah yeah doctors that
was uh that was an ontario uh a guy um man
[SPEAKER_04]: i'd love to talk to that dude yeah uh i
have no idea what happened to him but i
[SPEAKER_04]: don't either i never yeah the spanish guys
brought it up a level and maybe they got
[SPEAKER_04]: better and better with their auto flowers
and uh and i started doing autos probably
[SPEAKER_04]: about eight or nine years ago um because
the market demanded it um yeah yeah and
[SPEAKER_04]: all my all my friends i know a few of the
big farmers that made seeds for like royal
[SPEAKER_04]: queen dinofam sweet seeds pyramid seeds
all the spanish companies so i uh i ended
[SPEAKER_04]: up my my first uh big run of the autos was
a big bud uh northern lights big bud yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah and that's what i used as my first
breeding material to to breed into my uh
[SPEAKER_04]: my strains was that buddha seeds the
northern lights big one was that buddha no
[SPEAKER_04]: it's my buddy louis neighbor um the
neighbor so he sells to about three or
[SPEAKER_04]: four different companies that's awesome
though yeah yeah he yeah a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers there will sell to three or four
different seed companies and and uh yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the way it works a couple guys will
uh get really good at growing a few of the
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that they like and they dial it in
like i'm not not gonna shit talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: spanish guys they know what they're doing
great i think they do good work um yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: but but a lot of the the seed companies
are different than the seed breeders and
[SPEAKER_04]: growers um seed companies i would say 80
90 percent of them are just they're
[SPEAKER_04]: resellers they're good at marketing but
they're they don't actually make their own
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i call them i call them seed sellers
versus breeders like they're seed makers
[SPEAKER_02]: who don't really breed there's breeders
who breed and make seeds and then there's
[SPEAKER_02]: seed sellers who are just resellers don't
really have much of an interest in the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding aspect they're they're they're
interested in the movement of seeds yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a business they run the website i
often find it amazing how into seed making
[SPEAKER_05]: people get and how little they actually
understand what's going on just behind the
[SPEAKER_05]: curtain you know uh in that regard like i
mean it seems like when you talk like if i
[SPEAKER_05]: remember correctly i think it was 99 or
2000 the dutch closed their law that made
[SPEAKER_05]: seed making legal yeah they had a loophole
and then there was a bunch of busts and
[SPEAKER_05]: that seemed like it it shifted a bunch of
people's work to either switzerland or
[SPEAKER_05]: spain but it's kind of been like a little
bit that way the whole time like the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: reason most of that work even went out to
amsterdam in the first place was it was
[SPEAKER_05]: more permissive than the 80s and the
reagan drug war and all that and so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: almost like the the movement like looks
for where it's liberal and they can get
[SPEAKER_05]: away with it get away with it just enough
just enough and then you know like you
[SPEAKER_05]: were just saying like you know various
companies we won't name it it happens in
[SPEAKER_05]: america right now too where it's like
people have a brand and they have
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging and they have a following right
and so all they need to do is put seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: into that packaging and into that brand
and that following and people think that
[SPEAKER_05]: they did it from beginning to end yes when
in reality they farmed it out you know and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're just buying from a menu because
they have all that packaging and that
[SPEAKER_05]: brand and they're going to do a drop and
they're going to do a collab and people
[SPEAKER_05]: don't understand people think that all
these individually weed famous people most
[SPEAKER_05]: of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: making their own stuff and keeping their
own mothers and these major companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: have people that don't make any seeds that
have never touched a seed other than to
[SPEAKER_02]: resell them are the most successful
companies so like yeah pretty funny
[SPEAKER_04]: because yes a lot of the companies that
sell a lot of the seeds they've probably
[SPEAKER_04]: never grown hardly 10 plants in their life
exactly and even myself we sell a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: wholesale seeds uh for other companies
they want to buy a bulk batch of seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: they they package it themselves they're
better at marketing than i am yeah sure
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of people like that my
breeding so and most breeders are like
[SPEAKER_02]: that like just we're into the plant side
like i i've had to force myself to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into like the podcasting side and the
marketing aspect like none of the stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm comfortable with i mean to some degree
dude for a long time what regardless of
[SPEAKER_05]: what country you're in or whatever um
people that were deep weed people the best
[SPEAKER_05]: thing they could do was stay invisible and
keep their head down and so it's a very
[SPEAKER_05]: different skill set to be like oh get out
there promote yourself promote your brand
[SPEAKER_05]: promote your company be the face of it so
in a lot of ways like you know um it's
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just not it's just all different uh
yeah if you want to survive in this
[SPEAKER_04]: business you got to change and uh i've
been realizing that as well i have to be
[SPEAKER_04]: more proactive uh with social media or
people don't know who who you are um yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah i got it yeah a few uh weeks ago i
got on a stupid uh argument like you
[SPEAKER_04]: shouldn't do on facebook and some some
some guy was uh telling me like oh i'm the
[SPEAKER_04]: biggest player around here i move packs
and i supply stores and uh i've been into
[SPEAKER_04]: this from the old days i've been around
for like eight or nine years and i've
[SPEAKER_04]: never heard of you who are you and like
you've been around since eight or nine
[SPEAKER_04]: years the old school yeah so you kind of
engage with those people it's gonna just
[SPEAKER_02]: ignore it and it's very hard though
sometimes it's so hard when you just want
[SPEAKER_02]: to because our culture we were raised
different like it was a lot of us were
[SPEAKER_02]: raised with like an apprentice type
culture where like you fucking get your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking smack stop don't embarrass the
people around you don't embarrass your
[SPEAKER_05]: culture well it was it was hard to get i
mean i don't i i try to explain to people
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot and i don't i don't think it sinks
in very much because we live in such an
[SPEAKER_05]: information dominated society but when
most of us started how difficult it was
[SPEAKER_05]: even to figure out the basics yeah you
know there wasn't forums there wasn't the
[SPEAKER_05]: internet there wasn't the exchange of
ideas yet or anything like that and
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was so risky getting into a
trusted circle was hard and almost by
[SPEAKER_05]: accident more than intention yeah you know
it's almost like no might yeah i was a
[SPEAKER_04]: complete accident purposely we kept our
circle small because it was just too risky
[SPEAKER_05]: to uh have a big circle yeah yeah but uh
yeah but i you know i i'm not and i just
[SPEAKER_05]: want to make everybody clear like i'm not
dissing anybody in spain it it's mostly
[SPEAKER_05]: you know like because probably some of
those spanish breeders and some of those
[SPEAKER_05]: spanish farmers are really good at what
they do oh i know if you really kick ass
[SPEAKER_05]: growers and breeders in spain now you know
so it's not to disparage them it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: more like like you know you got these
these brands we don't need to mention them
[SPEAKER_05]: but you got some big brands that like kind
of ruled the 90s from holland yeah and
[SPEAKER_05]: then they start getting busted and they're
getting older like you said and they like
[SPEAKER_05]: they kind of lost their verb for it but
they have this brand and they can sell a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of seed and so you know you talk to a
lot of the dutch and they'll never claim
[SPEAKER_05]: that they lost a single thing sure parents
everything i mean why admit that you lost
[SPEAKER_05]: anything 40 years and running i mean
what's funny is you know i mean i guess
[SPEAKER_05]: i'll dissense you for a second or whatever
but like no they still if you go on their
[SPEAKER_05]: webpage today they still use the same
pictures that neville had in his seat bank
[SPEAKER_05]: catalogue in 89 and 90 yeah they haven't
updated their super skunk picture in 35
[SPEAKER_04]: years yeah some of the dutch some of the
bigger ones i know green how like my my uh
[SPEAKER_04]: my business partner is uh he's a friend
with arian because he ran time seat back
[SPEAKER_04]: from the day and he used to move a lot of
their the seeds for for arian and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: been in their mother room he said there
there is these trees in arian's uh main
[SPEAKER_04]: mother room that are the trees they've
been going for years and years and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a few companies that have the original
cuts um but most probably don't and we all
[SPEAKER_04]: we all know we all lost strains that we uh
that we reproduce now let's be realistic
[SPEAKER_02]: like greenhouse are the ones that are
probably the most notorious for doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: white labeling of seeds i have never
understood why arian would keep moms of
[SPEAKER_02]: anything for that long and he doesn't even
sell seeds of the shit that he's keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: these moms because he probably does it all
dude i mean yeah maybe he does but i just
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't make sense in my head like i
see them doing the the strain hunters and
[SPEAKER_02]: i don't i don't want to diss the dude
because he's done a lot i guess you know
[SPEAKER_02]: but um i see strain hunters i see them
collecting all these land-raised strains
[SPEAKER_02]: but i've never seen like these big massive
reproductions of all these strains i've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen them vault that that dude is i
couldn't say for sure but he probably is
[SPEAKER_05]: the most as far as the public people go
he's probably the most successful business
[SPEAKER_04]: person in cannabis sure yep but you know
franco franco uh before he died uh like
[SPEAKER_04]: franco uh arian's partner or yeah yeah
partner when he died franco had a heart
[SPEAKER_04]: for weed he uh he really he was a weed
geek you could never met your jars and
[SPEAKER_04]: samples in front of him and he was just
passionate about it he could smell
[SPEAKER_04]: everything and he would go on about it
arian barely he maybe spoke the odd joint
[SPEAKER_04]: in the evening um he's the businessman you
know the very face behind it but but uh
[SPEAKER_04]: franco he was the real deal i saw that you
know but uh like just like nowadays i
[SPEAKER_04]: actually talked to arian when i was down
in south america at the trade show down
[SPEAKER_04]: there and him he most of the seeds now are
made in columbia because it's so so cheap
[SPEAKER_04]: to produce down there and uh and when i
called when i told him i had no i got a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple hundred thousand auto flowers here
i need to move blah blah and he looked at
[SPEAKER_04]: me and laughed he goes i got a barrel full
yeah you can you can look at that and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like that's always i actually look at
holland and amsterdam i look at all the
[SPEAKER_05]: eras as like teaching moments in a way
because it doesn't really change that much
[SPEAKER_05]: and even like living in california and
having like legalization sort of start to
[SPEAKER_05]: sweep through america all the same stuff
that was happening in the 90s in holland
[SPEAKER_05]: is happening here now yeah you've got your
like underground weed nerds that just want
[SPEAKER_05]: to like have a good living and work with
plants and they have to bond with like
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of straight business people that
don't care nearly as much but have that
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect or have sides of like they have
access to capital or money or the things
[SPEAKER_05]: that you don't and you know yeah that's
one reason uh like six about five six
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago i moved back to canada uh a few
of the big uh companies here the big lps
[SPEAKER_04]: were kind of courting me and trying to get
me to come grow for them uh but i would
[SPEAKER_04]: have had to sell out all my genetics um
and give them my my strains and i would
[SPEAKER_04]: have just started making a wage maybe a
percentage of the a big company i'd maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: make five percent shares from the company
or something sure and uh and i kind of uh
[SPEAKER_04]: after a few of them came to me i that's
why my partner now uh taylor uh i chose
[SPEAKER_04]: him as a partner because he ran kind seed
really really well yeah he's old school he
[SPEAKER_04]: knows how he knows how to he's anybody
talks to him on the phone when they call
[SPEAKER_04]: our website uh taylor's the most friendly
guy he'll help like taylor and yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: when you talk to him man on the phone
you're his best friend after 10 minutes on
[SPEAKER_04]: the phone and he's a bit of a big stuff
teddy bear here and he'll he'll always
[SPEAKER_04]: give you free stuff um yeah which is fine
and but but he somebody who i know will uh
[SPEAKER_04]: can deal with the customer so i teamed up
with him even though he didn't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: funds and it was a bit of a slower rise to
get back into the game over here in canada
[SPEAKER_04]: but when he has when he's on the phone
with a customer that's one of our rules uh
[SPEAKER_04]: like when i teamed up with him years ago
he's like like there's no bullshit um like
[SPEAKER_04]: if a customer asks something about a
strain if you don't know just tell them
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't know um he even said that to me
yesterday i told him we're going on the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast he goes jay just don't say
anything that's not true if you don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: something no no and it's the advice i gave
him and he gave that yeah like it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: something beautiful isn't it to be in this
business for this long people see that
[SPEAKER_04]: bullshit um they do and there's no shame
in admitting you don't know what where
[SPEAKER_04]: that strain came from or what crosses what
exactly you tell people what you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's it so one thing that that's
held true on our podcast since day one is
[SPEAKER_02]: that our at least the people who are
serious weed nerds and that appreciate our
[SPEAKER_02]: show is that they always sense when
someone being transparent and just being
[SPEAKER_02]: like i don't know you know like i just
telling it the way it was and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: always see it in the comments everybody
always is like yep yep this guy's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshitter appreciate it you know all the
time yeah that's what i think yeah last
[SPEAKER_04]: night when i was watching uh uh pete there
on there yeah yeah it's 20 minutes into 20
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes into the podcast like oh this
guy's not a bullshitter nope um he's a
[SPEAKER_04]: real deal um yeah no bullshit to pete yeah
yeah yeah i actually like that it'd be
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting to have a little podcast with
me and him chatting because he knows a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of the ontario scene i know that bc scene
better and uh we could probably we're in
[SPEAKER_04]: the same circles we have all mutual
friends um but yeah it'd be pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting to actually to chat with him
sometime yeah that'd be great i'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: he'd enjoy it too he loves it yeah he's an
old dork like yeah i only watched uh one
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast of his but i think you guys have
about two or three yeah i think we did
[SPEAKER_05]: three total yeah yeah with him it's just
he's got so much information in there it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just about keeping them on point you know
because it's like he'll start talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about something and then he'll get a
thought in his head and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_05]: you're like 45 degree angle you're off on
a tangent about something totally else
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah you know and he yeah i like that
he gives unvarnished opinions of what he
[SPEAKER_05]: thinks about people you know yes that's my
favorite you know because it's like a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of times one of the hardest things about
like doing a show like this is like you're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to get information across right and
people come on for different reasons or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever you know but it's like it's very
difficult to be like just real and and
[SPEAKER_05]: what i mean by that is to not just like
make it's really tempting to make yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: look better than you are yeah you know
there's no need for that there's no need
[SPEAKER_05]: for that it hurts you know as any of us
know it's like a lot of breeding is
[SPEAKER_05]: accidents a lot of breeding is failure you
know a lot of breeding is like you wish
[SPEAKER_05]: you had the things you had back then now
because you do a better job with them now
[SPEAKER_05]: than you would have done 15 years ago and
you were still just figuring it out and
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it it uh i actually think it's
amazing how much cool stuff has come out
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis um despite like most of it
coming out of garages or little warehouses
[SPEAKER_05]: or little green little guys yeah i mean
when i was first going when i was first
[SPEAKER_05]: going to holland i just had no idea that
like every five or six years weed would
[SPEAKER_05]: reinvent itself and i mean and this and
what i mean by that is that like if you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't get seeds when they're available you
have no idea if those seeds with those
[SPEAKER_02]: parents will ever be around again well i
mean that changed over time though it
[SPEAKER_02]: accelerated the the process of how quick
strains turned over accelerated i mean og
[SPEAKER_02]: kush lasted 20 freaking years like white
widow lasted you know 20 freaking years
[SPEAKER_02]: but now it's like cookies then runs then
you know this and that it's going way
[SPEAKER_02]: faster the fads are going faster i think
yeah i think that's modern marketing yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah yeah it's just marketing for the
newbies um yeah yeah but yeah like uh
[SPEAKER_04]: actually to go back to uh what pete said
about uh i'm gonna touch the tangent here
[SPEAKER_04]: as well uh what pete said about uh mark
emery and back in the day um he made some
[SPEAKER_04]: really good points and uh like to clarify
like last the last podcast we were
[SPEAKER_04]: chatting and uh i was a little bit vague
about some of my history back in the day
[SPEAKER_04]: uh working with with emery but uh i don't
have to be that vague but uh yeah for
[SPEAKER_04]: about a year or so like with federation
when i split from federation um it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: big uh argument i had with with mark and
with mike from federation um because uh we
[SPEAKER_04]: i was out of the city uh for for about a
month or so and i came back and my partner
[SPEAKER_04]: at federation had a bunch of strains on
mark emery's catalogue that i know did not
[SPEAKER_04]: exist oh that sucks dude he was just
renamed and i uh and that was cut at the
[SPEAKER_04]: last straw and i went in i i went in i
told mark hey mark i'm done with
[SPEAKER_04]: federation me and mike are split i'm
starting my own seed company and by the
[SPEAKER_04]: way all those crosses that you have that
are in the catalogue they don't actually
[SPEAKER_04]: exist um they're just renamed seeds
because mike wanted to make money and mark
[SPEAKER_04]: did not care he goes oh well of course the
catalogue yeah and uh and i was like and
[SPEAKER_04]: that and that's when i start i stopped
selling uh seeds to mark that was that
[SPEAKER_04]: same day that i was done uh so i went over
to kind seed i started selling to kind
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds uh amsterdam seed company or
amsterdam the amsterdam cafe yeah right
[SPEAKER_04]: and and if you if you companies online in
in ontario but i i stopped selling to mark
[SPEAKER_04]: emery that that that very same day and
that's awesome it was only about probably
[SPEAKER_04]: about five or six years later when i don't
know if you guys know uh michelle rainy no
[SPEAKER_04]: she came up she anyway she came to uh uh
vancouver and she took over the business
[SPEAKER_04]: end of mark emery seeds in uh probably the
mid-2000s and that's and she ran she ran
[SPEAKER_04]: it straight and because mark was too busy
doing his political shit oh yeah yeah like
[SPEAKER_04]: getting into trouble and blowing money um
so when michelle took over she ran it
[SPEAKER_04]: straight and she was honest about it so
that's that's why i went back into the
[SPEAKER_04]: emery catalogue but but before that from
about 1999 till 2005 i never sold to mark
[SPEAKER_04]: because i i knew i was off you know what i
gotta ask don't you you know what i gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: ask what what strains were on the list
what what strains were on the list oh dude
[SPEAKER_04]: i i can't you know what there's about four
or five rooms that he had i i can't really
[SPEAKER_04]: remember um had to though had to try i i'd
have to i i actually i do have some my the
[SPEAKER_04]: old emery catalogs here i could probably
figure it out by looking at the old
[SPEAKER_04]: catalogs but uh off the top of my head i
wrote it off and left so i yeah of course
[SPEAKER_02]: like they weren't they weren't your
creations so why the fuck would you care
[SPEAKER_05]: that's me that's always been the risk of
like when you're buying especially from
[SPEAKER_05]: different countries and stuff and like an
order comes in for you know eight packs of
[SPEAKER_05]: this and they don't have it but they have
other seeds and so they're like well i'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just take the money and i'll fill this
order with this is close enough and off it
[SPEAKER_05]: goes and and you know that's a slippery
slope indeed yeah i always tell people
[SPEAKER_04]: unless it's a really big established
company if if if a company online always
[SPEAKER_04]: has a strain in stock chances are they're
bullshitting um like as a breeder myself
[SPEAKER_04]: too like sometimes you run out of seeds
and i i don't have room in my group to
[SPEAKER_04]: make that strain for another six months so
yeah you can't always have every strain in
[SPEAKER_04]: stock unless you have an insanely
well-organized large operation um that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the one thing i tell people when they ask
me what's the first thing i think yep when
[SPEAKER_02]: when people ask me what's one thing i can
look for to know if a seed company has uh
[SPEAKER_02]: is reputable and i'd say well look how
long they've been around and has any of
[SPEAKER_02]: their stuff ever gone out of stock that'll
that'll give you your answer yeah i mean i
[SPEAKER_02]: mean it's not always true because there
are amazing people who can keep their
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in stock and much better than i ever
could obviously but yeah for the most part
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're doing it legit they're going to
run out of stock of stuff every now and
[SPEAKER_05]: then and you know sometimes you're doing
regular if if you're doing regular reading
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes you get like a prolific amount
of seeds as he was just talking about and
[SPEAKER_05]: you you might have a 55 gallon drum like
he was saying like full of whatever um and
[SPEAKER_05]: then you're not going to run out you know
sometimes it's just unpopular yeah you
[SPEAKER_04]: know but but you but you can't really sell
them after three years or so the
[SPEAKER_04]: germination rate goes down if you're not
storing them right sure every year when
[SPEAKER_04]: you start seeing a dip in the germination
rate um that's what i found any good seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah yeah yeah if they're not fridge
stored people don't understand like how
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly like because they can go from
being real nice to just all of a sudden a
[SPEAKER_02]: month later nothing's popping i saw it
happen with a lot of my old strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff for whatever reason all at the same
time it just took a shit and that was that
[SPEAKER_02]: can't sell anymore one of the things i
think is interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah i just i was just saying that like
one of the big shifts at least that's
[SPEAKER_05]: happened in america is like a lot of the
old school people have what i call you
[SPEAKER_05]: know they have lines right and like you
were saying you have lines and you remake
[SPEAKER_05]: those lines at different times for new
seed a lot of the smaller breeders these
[SPEAKER_05]: days everything is a one-off yeah
everything is made once and it exists
[SPEAKER_05]: until it's gone and the likelihood they
ever made it again is very small yeah you
[SPEAKER_04]: know and when they do remake it it's a
different phenotype yeah exactly so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: become very flash in the pan in that way
where people advertise a drop and if you
[SPEAKER_05]: want that hybrid you better get it then
because you know it's not like the old
[SPEAKER_05]: seed company days in america at least for
a lot of people where it's like i have
[SPEAKER_05]: these h drains here are the lines i offer
yeah yeah you know and i been working on
[SPEAKER_05]: these lines for quite a while um and so
you know but but strangely people want
[SPEAKER_05]: worked lines but they also want new stuff
every single drop yeah yes that's what i
[SPEAKER_02]: ran into and that's why i said with the
with the blue bonnet shit i was like i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: done i'm done i'm not changing anymore i'm
just staying because either way i'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: winning so i'm just gonna stay here see
how it holds yeah sticking the gun i wish
[SPEAKER_04]: i had some of the same cuts i had back in
the 90s and i would have stayed there with
[SPEAKER_04]: a few of those strains that because you
can't get any better if you only knew yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: if you only knew right right like some of
those pure lines from neville i mean mad
[SPEAKER_05]: and i were talking to someone that was uh
you know very close to neville the last
[SPEAKER_05]: you know decade or so of his life and even
he bitched about he wished he had a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff he had in the 80s and early 90s
now yeah because you got you know 30 years
[SPEAKER_05]: of breeding in and man what could i do
with them in my 60s yeah i was in it you
[SPEAKER_05]: know i mean i think part of life is i wish
i had now what i had back when i was an
[SPEAKER_05]: idiot kid yeah and i think that keeps
happening the older you get you're like
[SPEAKER_05]: man i wish you know because you just you
gain experience if you if you're good at
[SPEAKER_02]: what you do and you care you know is that
a man thing like does anybody know any
[SPEAKER_02]: women that have that same drive for
something like that like their drive for
[SPEAKER_02]: like i don't know any women that are like
that about they're like oh i wish i had
[SPEAKER_02]: that old strain from back in 62 like never
heard a woman say that ever and i i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know maybe it's like a man's drive to i
don't know but there's a few but not very
[SPEAKER_02]: many yeah i wouldn't think there's very
many yeah i just think there's some
[SPEAKER_05]: industries that are that are male
dominated yeah that's true um and i think
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is some combination of it yeah
actually yeah we're still in canada
[SPEAKER_04]: there's quite a few women that are big
players in the game yeah especially in the
[SPEAKER_04]: legal recreational market because oh women
are face it like they're better at doing
[SPEAKER_04]: uh and going through the legal system than
we are and creative too like i know some
[SPEAKER_06]: really creative women in the recreational
market that are doing really well with
[SPEAKER_06]: their branding and stuff like that just
because of it you know what i mean there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a huge gap up here between the old school
guys that have been doing it forever and
[SPEAKER_06]: and businessmen and try and throw the
government into it's just miserable yeah a
[SPEAKER_04]: few times some of my best partners were
that ran my websites um and they're weed
[SPEAKER_04]: geeks and you can out smoke them so in
south america i encountered that as well
[SPEAKER_04]: at argentina and chile women are running
the show down there um they're running
[SPEAKER_04]: they're doing the seals they're running
the shops uh it's it's it's more more so
[SPEAKER_04]: than canada in that way um i didn't really
expect that because it's more of a
[SPEAKER_04]: machismo uh male dominated culture but uh
yeah down there uh yeah the women are
[SPEAKER_02]: they're hardcore that's awesome that's
awesome you know a lot of the women
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that i know to actually interact
with the plant tend to be much better
[SPEAKER_02]: growers than men too for whatever reason
they have that connection yeah i don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to admit it but yeah that's true at
the end of the day you're taking care of a
[SPEAKER_04]: living thing right yeah back in vancouver
uh all the asian growers um it was all the
[SPEAKER_04]: women running running rooms um oh wow and
you know all the like the vietnamese and
[SPEAKER_04]: chinese uh groups in the vancouver yeah
the women would be in there taking care of
[SPEAKER_04]: the plants and the guys would be out there
selling and dealing with the gangsters
[SPEAKER_02]: gambling and gambling away their money
yeah do you know much about that culture
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's not a culture that that's ever
really been talked to about like the the
[SPEAKER_02]: asian culture uh the asian black market
market culture in cannabis or in in
[SPEAKER_04]: vancouver uh we have a very very large
asian uh uh population there um yeah so uh
[SPEAKER_04]: like the one city i lived in right next to
vancouver called richmond it's probably 80
[SPEAKER_04]: percent uh our asian descent um wow and
they they would they'd rent these big
[SPEAKER_04]: giant mansions and they would pump out the
pound that's awesome no pots no nothing
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah dirt on the floor yeah lights yeah
you'd walk into these places there'd be
[SPEAKER_06]: mold halfway up the walls like wherever
the poly started up was fine and down was
[SPEAKER_06]: black mold and they'd just run these giant
hothouses burn them and turn them and on
[SPEAKER_06]: to the next place like it was wicked for a
while yeah when they when they got big in
[SPEAKER_04]: the uh late 90s uh it's their fault that
that that the rental uh societies uh told
[SPEAKER_04]: uh the police told the landlords that you
have to inspect your your rental house
[SPEAKER_04]: every two months oh no and that's all
because of the big asian gangsters who
[SPEAKER_04]: would go in and destroy a house they took
that's a law three fair crops and then
[SPEAKER_04]: they move on to the next house it kind of
wrecked the rental uh scene uh in british
[SPEAKER_02]: columbia wow i didn't even know that was a
law that would yeah only in british
[SPEAKER_04]: columbia only in british columbia because
one out of three rental homes were a girl
[SPEAKER_04]: off commercial drop not not a small one
it's actually not i mean i think that's
[SPEAKER_05]: just the story to some degree like of how
like a lot of times like like immigrant
[SPEAKER_05]: populations work you know in the sense
that harder well yeah they they not only
[SPEAKER_05]: that but they have like tighter family
units the people are willing to live on
[SPEAKER_05]: less um you know they're willing to bond
together to raise themselves up it
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever they're doing is far better than
where they came from to begin with they
[SPEAKER_05]: stick together uh you know ratting on the
group is unthinkable because it's your
[SPEAKER_05]: entire family and everyone you know and
all of your connections and all that and
[SPEAKER_05]: so it's actually a pretty effective method
and it goes on in america too um in all
[SPEAKER_05]: kinds of different ways i used to i didn't
know very much about it but i used to have
[SPEAKER_05]: some friends um in the canadian scene you
know 20 something plus years ago and they
[SPEAKER_05]: were independent and they said the hardest
thing to be independent was like you
[SPEAKER_05]: basically had to be invisible to the
asians and the bikers because those were
[SPEAKER_05]: the two those were the two big groups they
kind of wanted to dominate everything and
[SPEAKER_05]: so you know he was always like i always
have to bob and weave and not irritate
[SPEAKER_05]: either either of those groups you know
yeah um and yeah and vancouver and british
[SPEAKER_04]: columbia back in day was exactly the same
yeah um edmonton too everywhere across
[SPEAKER_04]: canada was the same uh yeah if you got up
to a certain size you kind of to not get
[SPEAKER_04]: taxed um you kind of had to know someone
or yeah but i was lucky i was in the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: business um so they kind of seen us as a
novelty they didn't take us too seriously
[SPEAKER_04]: we weren't competition to them so and i
was some of the boys i would give clones
[SPEAKER_04]: to and uh they would often buy their
personal bag off of me and they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: even smoke their own stuff because they
fertilize it right up to the end and they
[SPEAKER_04]: they sell it to the states and call it
beasters and but they wouldn't even smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: their own stuff so the boys would come to
me and buy their personal stash so i i was
[SPEAKER_04]: always kind of left alone to do whatever i
wanted but uh but yeah there is once you
[SPEAKER_04]: get to a certain size you kind of have to
have the blessing of god i wonder if they
[SPEAKER_04]: were trying to tax emery at all not really
i don't think so yeah he was too flashy i
[SPEAKER_04]: think they didn't want to be associated
and get busted and he kind of took the uh
[SPEAKER_04]: heat away from them he took the heat away
and he was he was out there advertising bc
[SPEAKER_04]: bud to the world bc bud so great so so he
brought everybody to the market he brought
[SPEAKER_04]: people to british columbia to buy their
weed so they let mark be he was a useful
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd come because that's where his store
was and then you'd find the 10 other
[SPEAKER_05]: stores that were hidden around the market
right honestly if you're even in america
[SPEAKER_05]: too if you're on the flop the flower
market and the seed market don't really
[SPEAKER_05]: intersect very much that's right that's
true they just don't like and they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: affect each other all that much if you're
pumping out specific clones for production
[SPEAKER_05]: you know like somebody with 30 different
strains trying to make money in that way
[SPEAKER_05]: he's not affecting your clientele or what
you're doing or your life at all it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: not even the same world yeah it's really
not the same world yeah since i moved back
[SPEAKER_04]: to canada about five six years ago i make
seeds if i had a couple pounds of weed i
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't even know where to sell it same
it's bizarre same like yeah when you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds for that long like i tell people
this a lot too that that are interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into the seed game i always tell
them if you're ever going to get serious
[SPEAKER_02]: about it you're going to have to make that
choice one day to permanently turn to
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and when you do flower it's only
going to be your testers but you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be in flower production anymore
you're going to lose those contacts
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually because you're just not going
to need them you're going to devote your
[SPEAKER_02]: life to seed so you know it you're
eventually going to have to choose one or
[SPEAKER_04]: the other yeah exactly and i've always uh
my buddies back in vancouver back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day they they look at me like i'm an idiot
sometimes because i'd be growing these big
[SPEAKER_04]: rooms of uh congolese and mexican satelas
that take 16 weeks to flower i like yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: like jane you could have flipped two crops
by now i made all this money and and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know maybe they were right but uh my my
i'm a weed geek though so i um so yeah it
[SPEAKER_04]: was all about selecting for me i was
looking at the long game so i know even if
[SPEAKER_04]: i exit the industry i can come back as
long as i have my genetics and stay true
[SPEAKER_04]: to my what they are and don't bullshit i
can always re-enter the industry um but
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just growing bud and just flippin
pounds
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah i think there's multiple ways to
do that i mean where i live there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of people that sold flour to support
their lifestyle and then did a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding for themselves and their friends
because that's what interested them you
[SPEAKER_05]: know so it's almost like they had a
commercial side of it but then that funded
[SPEAKER_04]: their interests yeah you grow up one
commercial room to pay the mortgage and
[SPEAKER_04]: pay the bills and then you play in the
other room tough not to be interested
[SPEAKER_05]: that's for sure yeah yeah because for my
experience has been and i don't know about
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys but like the older you get in the
weed scene in order to stay excited and
[SPEAKER_05]: like you know pumped to get into your room
uh i'm in my mid-40s or whatever most of
[SPEAKER_05]: my friends if you tell them i want you to
monocrop this they could probably they
[SPEAKER_05]: could do a good job but they'd probably
want to like just shoot themselves after a
[SPEAKER_05]: while because they'd be so bored you know
like literally like like like you know my
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy you know you lose your passion yeah
yeah you're like okay i grow these two
[SPEAKER_05]: strains i've dialed it in i figured out
all the when to raise and lower the ec i
[SPEAKER_05]: figured out exactly how it likes to be
grown and now i'm just making minor
[SPEAKER_05]: adjustments and steering the ship and i
feel like i'm a factory worker yeah we're
[SPEAKER_04]: like seeds and all this other stuff it
brings joy exactly but we need those
[SPEAKER_04]: people i have to produce uh weed for the
for the public but uh that's not me um
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah definitely i have to grow i'm growing
out seedlings it's like christmas time
[SPEAKER_04]: when you when you start a new batch of
seeds to see what's going to come up uh
[SPEAKER_04]: i'm like a little kid at christmas
wondering what's under the tree yeah for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure yeah but yeah he's more of a pick a
few strains and dial it in so we all need
[SPEAKER_04]: each other in the industry but uh but
that's not my game i mean what what i find
[SPEAKER_05]: hard about like being a breeder seed
popping or anything like that is that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty small amount of size seed pop you
can do where you can honestly judge like
[SPEAKER_05]: what just happened because if you do a big
seed pop and you want to save it and you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have backups and then you want to
get all your friends that you trust to
[SPEAKER_05]: help you smoke and test it like you can do
a big seed run but eventually how are you
[SPEAKER_05]: going to judge those hundreds of plants
yes right and you can and the problem is
[SPEAKER_05]: for me is that all the stuff that you can
visually see like you can be like oh that
[SPEAKER_05]: one has the structure i like that one has
the the leaf ratio this one has the resin
[SPEAKER_05]: but the part that really will make a
strain lasting or not to me is invisible
[SPEAKER_05]: like you don't know how it's going to
affect you or taste until you try it yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: you can't look at the you can't look at it
behind you and be like oh that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be the one yeah in fact also like what i
like to do as well as uh after i've did my
[SPEAKER_04]: selections out of a fino hunt um you have
to grow the clone of the variety too not
[SPEAKER_04]: just this seedling after you oh yeah you
see the structures and different
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics and you gotta yeah put it
through some stress you only get to see
[SPEAKER_05]: that one way one time as a csi and i
talked about that a whole bunch where i
[SPEAKER_05]: got to a point where i never flowered like
when i was testing seeds inside i never
[SPEAKER_05]: flowered the seed plant yeah i would take
clones and root all the clones and flower
[SPEAKER_05]: the clone because i would see the seed
plant once and it would never be that way
[SPEAKER_05]: again and i was always interested well
what is the clone gonna do yeah how is
[SPEAKER_05]: that yeah because that's gonna tell you
that you know you don't have that you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have that taproot you don't have
that seed plant bigger you don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: same stretchiness it's just different well
even now even though i'm switching most of
[SPEAKER_04]: my rooms over to leds uh when i do my seed
selection because i've been growing under
[SPEAKER_04]: uh hps for for decades when i do my
selecting in my tester room i do it under
[SPEAKER_04]: the hps and i yeah trim nothing off the
bottom i leave all those shaggy bits at
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottom to see how and i don't pinch it
just to see how it grows naturally sure
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's what i've been doing for for 25
years uh so i want to see what it does all
[SPEAKER_04]: on its own without any manipulation uh and
then i make my selections just the way
[SPEAKER_04]: i've been doing it for that's that's my
way of doing it um because and then after
[SPEAKER_04]: that with the clone then i start playing
see if it ties down good how it reacts
[SPEAKER_05]: when you pinch it i mean because sometimes
unless you see what it does you won't know
[SPEAKER_05]: what kind of manipulation to apply to get
what you want out of it you know if
[SPEAKER_05]: something if you don't pinch it and
something makes some incredible two and a
[SPEAKER_05]: half foot long cola you might not want to
pinch it and go for all those side buds
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah you might want you might want to
leave it that way you know sometimes you
[SPEAKER_05]: might grow something and all those bottom
nugs end up nice and solid you know
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes they end up all leafy in a mess
and so if it's leafy in a mess you're like
[SPEAKER_05]: oh i have to strip all that off to
concentrate it up top but sometimes it'll
[SPEAKER_05]: make nice nug all the way down to the base
without any effort and you know sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to watch what the plant tells you
exactly yeah i remember we had the first
[SPEAKER_04]: big plant i seen that i was impressed with
was actually breeder steve's uh
[SPEAKER_04]: shishkeberry and oh my god like it was
like three feet tall just one big giant
[SPEAKER_04]: cola and just you hardly seen any uh red
hairs on it it was just big green and
[SPEAKER_04]: crystalline uh with almost no red hairs
and what did it smell like um i always
[SPEAKER_02]: wondered with shishkeberry because i've
never had like just a little bit on the
[SPEAKER_04]: fruity side i'd say it was there was
almost too much resin that it cut out all
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpenes there wasn't it wasn't really
turkey strains i know what you mean okay
[SPEAKER_04]: you fucked up and it was huge and lime
lime green huge lime green buds i gotta i
[SPEAKER_04]: gotta hand steve that one man he he nailed
that one that's why people like this and
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was a yeah it was a it was a
quality name yeah i mean people we can we
[SPEAKER_05]: can talk about all the you know sometimes
what's funny about it is like a cool name
[SPEAKER_05]: goes a long way and even even shishkeberry
like it's got a cool nickname you can just
[SPEAKER_05]: call it the shish you know like things
that like that matters you know yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: there's so many strains that i know that
are just just kick ass but they have a
[SPEAKER_04]: shitty name and nobody buys them yeah um
it's sad but you know what's that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: could think of one strain uh each one of
you one strain that you think should get
[SPEAKER_02]: more recognition than it currently does
what what what's this first strain that
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to your minds so from vancouver
island seed company jiffy pot okay um and
[SPEAKER_04]: from my own stuff probably my first
contact um the first contact yeah because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's high cvd and super terpy but i don't
really sell i got a big bag of it but i
[SPEAKER_04]: don't really sell many seeds and it's and
people don't know what they're missing on
[SPEAKER_04]: that one um yeah it's just super super
terpy you just rub your hand up against
[SPEAKER_04]: the leaves and you know you're sticking to
it um and it's a nice buzz um really nice
[SPEAKER_04]: buzz it's not super stony but it's one of
those quality when my son when my son
[SPEAKER_04]: started smoking weed i i that's the strain
i gave him because i wanted to hire cvd
[SPEAKER_04]: and lower thc because yeah yeah you're 18
years old you got to get your head
[SPEAKER_04]: together a little bit and get to work um
so i told hey if you want to smoke weed do
[SPEAKER_04]: my first contact so uh but no it's one of
my one of my best strains that i people
[SPEAKER_04]: don't buy a lot of and and they should
because it's it's one of my best ones um
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah other than that strain of mine
and jiffy pot from uh from vancouver
[SPEAKER_04]: island seed company those are yeah the two
right off the top of my head those are the
[SPEAKER_06]: two i could think of what you got casey
i'm all about the death baba i think uh we
[SPEAKER_06]: up here we got it's the pre-98 death baba
cut it's called and it's just like that
[SPEAKER_06]: obnoxious kush gas candy like it's just
amazing and that the like the medical
[SPEAKER_06]: benefits that come along with i don't know
if it's the mixture of terpenes or what
[SPEAKER_06]: but uh it's phenomenal like even for
myself for nausea like it's just like it's
[SPEAKER_06]: one of those strains that i could never if
i had to pick one for the rest of my life
[SPEAKER_06]: that would be it and you know what uh if
you give me a couple minutes i'll figure
[SPEAKER_02]: it out i've got test results here i just
gotta dig them up i want to um i want to
[SPEAKER_02]: say a long time ago somebody gave me seeds
of it it was like a black domino baba
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe but i i think that there's been a
few over the years that have had that name
[SPEAKER_02]: so i always wonder like when people talk
about the yeah up here it's just we just
[SPEAKER_06]: call it the pre-98 cut it's been a cut
that's been around for years and years and
[SPEAKER_06]: years similar smell to the og kush yeah
it's like super super gassy super like
[SPEAKER_02]: that obnoxious kush i wonder if it's just
our baba down here the pre-98 baba or if
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a hybrid of the pre-98 baba yeah i
have no idea i i have the og kush and i
[SPEAKER_04]: i'm not a big kush guy but uh everybody
has it i stick with my own strains but uh
[SPEAKER_02]: i like the high of og kush i like the the
high of old og kush to me is what always
[SPEAKER_02]: it like it no matter what any cup i've
ever gone to where it's like a real legit
[SPEAKER_02]: cup if someone brings a really good cut of
og kush it's very hard for anybody to not
[SPEAKER_02]: pick that one as the winner like it just
seems to always be the winner in the room
[SPEAKER_04]: uh for the high there's a few similarities
as well with the cheese i know people have
[SPEAKER_04]: noticed that the cheese is a little more
rank smelling yeah but uh there is some
[SPEAKER_04]: similarities uh when it's overdried you
can really see the uh similarities with
[SPEAKER_06]: the cheese um so in this death baba it's
dominant as beta carofyline and then
[SPEAKER_06]: fenchel uh alpha humulane isoboroneel uh
lemonine beta mercine pining alpha and
[SPEAKER_04]: beta pining complex i think that i think
that just means it gets you fucked up yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah yeah it's very complex is what it is
yeah yeah like i've uh out salmon fishing
[SPEAKER_06]: on the ocean seasick like puking two puffs
straight me right out same thing i had
[SPEAKER_06]: knee surgery yeah knee surgery come out of
the hospital they knock you out for it
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah and uh woke up dry heaving puking
tried the gravel no no good out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: hospital two puffs straight me right out
like pain management and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_06]: like on the medical side of things like i
think it should it should be everywhere
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a company finally i think bringing
it out in canada here pistol in paris um
[SPEAKER_06]: they're going to be launching it into the
legal recreational market and like i think
[SPEAKER_06]: it should be on the medical side of things
for sure like if they should do studies on
[SPEAKER_04]: it right i'm gonna be crossing it with my
ramen in here on the next round as well so
[SPEAKER_04]: uh give it a try he keeps raving about it
for three years and i've smoked it it
[SPEAKER_02]: kicks kicks my ass yeah i'm gonna have to
try it i'm gonna i'm gonna have to try it
[SPEAKER_02]: like for nausea stuff that sounds awesome
that sounds killer yeah no yeah if you can
[SPEAKER_06]: find it it's uh it's something else yeah
not so what about you what's this idea
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i'll take them what's a strain that
you think has a like has a crappy name
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe or whatever and doesn't sell is or
get the shine that it should uh i mean
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a bunch of them but uh i'll get
like the uh dog shit yeah you know there's
[SPEAKER_05]: this there's there's this strain it used
to be called in minneapolis it had a way
[SPEAKER_05]: cooler name it was called electric vogaloo
and it's a little mysterious what it is
[SPEAKER_05]: but i think it it might be like silver
pearl by haze or it might it's it's some
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of hazy hybrid from the early 90s
yeah and it's one of those ones where like
[SPEAKER_05]: you know matt and i you know we have some
get-togethers with a bunch of friends you
[SPEAKER_05]: know and people gather from all over and
breeders come and stuff and it always ends
[SPEAKER_05]: up being one of those ones that like
everybody isn't it's in their top two or
[SPEAKER_05]: three that they tried and they always
can't figure out why it's not more popular
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's definitely one of those ones i i
you know i was talking about it the other
[SPEAKER_02]: night with someone i was like i think when
it comes to elites they're like everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to love bubba everybody seems to
universally for the most part like og kush
[SPEAKER_02]: and everyone likes electric vogaloo and i
can't think of anything else that like
[SPEAKER_02]: some people like blueberry some people
don't some people you know that like those
[SPEAKER_05]: three i could think of i i mean i i tend
to think too that we're in such a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial industry in a way that people
only want to grow what's currently popular
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and so when you get old like we are
now or older there's been all these great
[SPEAKER_05]: strains that have gone through your hands
that deserve their moment in the sun but
[SPEAKER_05]: they just don't get enough play because
they're not currently popular they're not
[SPEAKER_05]: being cropped for production people aren't
getting to try them that much and so as a
[SPEAKER_05]: result of that it has nothing to do with
the quality of the plant itself it
[SPEAKER_05]: basically has to do with this weird hype
and people's access are not to it you know
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's and that and then it ends up
just getting saved by heads and passed
[SPEAKER_05]: around and grown for personal and passed
around to friends and stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody can't believe um what uh you
know and names are a huge thing i'll tell
[SPEAKER_05]: a story um there was this strain in mendo
that was made by a friend and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: called it was it was made by everybody's
shot it was called big wreck it was big
[SPEAKER_05]: bud by train wreck okay and it was frosty
and it was beautiful and it finished at
[SPEAKER_05]: the end of september it was really pretty
but nobody wanted big wreck nobody was
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in big bud train wreck right
yeah and so one of my friends changed the
[SPEAKER_05]: name to berry white and as soon as the
name changed to berry white not only could
[SPEAKER_05]: they move endless packs of it but they got
a premium you know they got they got a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple they got a you know they got a
couple hundred bucks more than they should
[SPEAKER_05]: for other things and it was all about the
name change nobody wanted big wreck but
[SPEAKER_04]: berry white i want some of that happened
with that that happened with us as well a
[SPEAKER_04]: few years ago when i started working with
the og curse um uh we just had it named as
[SPEAKER_04]: a cross and never sold and then we our og
curse crossed with the romulan we renamed
[SPEAKER_04]: it ogopogo uh and it started flying off
the shelves um i don't know if you know
[SPEAKER_04]: what ogopogo is yeah yeah yeah it's out
like our uh see the Loch Ness monster yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah exactly and uh great strain catchy
names like that make a big difference you
[SPEAKER_02]: know i i tend to think jeezel is is one
that i've noticed that like it's it's one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the original cams but for some reason
it's no one's ever hunted it and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that had it dropped it for whatever reason
because the name just never caught on it's
[SPEAKER_05]: a dumb name i mean it's it's and that's
what i was saying before too about how
[SPEAKER_05]: like a lot of weed access is kind of flash
in the pan where it's like if you weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: there for those few years you might not
have access to it at all and so most of
[SPEAKER_05]: the currently popular strains aren't
nearly as good as the collection of old
[SPEAKER_05]: school classics that some people market
shifts and 10 years later four dudes held
[SPEAKER_04]: onto it yeah yeah and that's like the most
common thing well thank i i'm thankful for
[SPEAKER_04]: those four dudes yeah is that right i've
gotten a lot of strains back uh from uh
[SPEAKER_04]: some old friends uh that i thought strange
that i thought were gone years ago and
[SPEAKER_04]: people come out of the closet and say hey
i still got a cut yeah what yeah what's
[SPEAKER_05]: really important actually is is people in
like i don't know about canada
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically but like in america people
that like you know live in areas that like
[SPEAKER_05]: don't change all that much right so they
can they can grow their two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: little strains and they can sell them to
their friends and their friends are just
[SPEAKER_05]: stoked on getting really high quality weed
and the fads don't affect them yeah that's
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of times who you find oh i thought
this thing was lost and they're like no i
[SPEAKER_05]: have it you know i never was forced to
change and we still love it that's how i
[SPEAKER_04]: got my uh Hawaiian sativa back yeah a good
old boy from rural manitoba said hey i
[SPEAKER_04]: still have it i bought it in 1999 and he
had a beautiful cut and thank god for him
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's a great line classic classic
wine sativa line one of our buddies is i i
[SPEAKER_02]: just gave all my seeds of it to my buddy
rings and he just did a big pop of it so
[SPEAKER_02]: he's gonna be running a bunch of those and
reproduce those too just to see what you
[SPEAKER_02]: can find in them but that's my favorite i
mean i never had a traditional hawaiian
[SPEAKER_02]: line because it's before my era but out of
all the lines i've ever had called
[SPEAKER_02]: hawaiian that was the one i thought was
the nicest it was a nice like sativa sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: just had a really nice quality high though
really nice yeah anything that i usually
[SPEAKER_04]: see now that's called hawaiian is not like
it was back in the day uh yeah a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the hawaiian from the 90s i remember a
real what they call a menthol menthol
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor uh sativas uh and that's how i
remember the hawaiian interesting but
[SPEAKER_04]: nowadays no not you don't get that menthol
flavor very much anymore it was intense
[SPEAKER_02]: intensely uh menthol and that was during
the 90s from hawaii up there in in canada
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah yeah i got well with federation seek
out we got those uh genetics from uh from
[SPEAKER_04]: vancouver island seed company from from g
man there um yeah he had a few different
[SPEAKER_04]: versions of it a few different crosses it
was amazing it's uh but he got it straight
[SPEAKER_02]: from hawaii i know we've touched on him
briefly before but it seems like he had
[SPEAKER_02]: like a major major influence on your
career at least and a few others around
[SPEAKER_02]: you and the strains in in canada in
general not just in vancouver island yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: he was a big influence for me uh and a few
other breeders on the island and a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the source genetics came from him he was
growing since the mid 70s and uh you know
[SPEAKER_04]: i i was a youngster on the scene coming in
mid 90s so yeah i'd love to talk to him
[SPEAKER_02]: about when he saw the first indicas and
stuff like that since he was around during
[SPEAKER_02]: that time and what his experience was with
them has he ever told you about anything
[SPEAKER_04]: like that um oh yeah yeah we we were we
grew side by side for years uh back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day but uh he's kind of dropped off the
planet here and i actually mentioned or i
[SPEAKER_04]: messaged him about two or three months ago
and he hasn't gotten back to me he doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: go online so yeah hopefully he'll turn up
because he sounds like an interesting guy
[SPEAKER_04]: to interview me yeah like you probably
won't ever see his face oh that's funny
[SPEAKER_05]: old old school old old school yeah yeah
it's hard it's hard for some people to
[SPEAKER_05]: turn off that decades of programming
that's true i don't want you to see my
[SPEAKER_05]: face i don't want you to see my name i
don't want you to have any association i
[SPEAKER_05]: mean we even have friends of ours that'll
come on the show and you know they want to
[SPEAKER_05]: wear a mask or they want to be in a dark
room or you know they live in a state
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not that permissive yet and they
worry about it getting out you know or
[SPEAKER_05]: even friends or family or you know in some
cases even wives you know something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that knowing yeah so everyone has a
different perspective on like what their
[SPEAKER_05]: own safety is or perception of it yeah a
different era yeah for me even like for
[SPEAKER_06]: been selling since mid 90s and like didn't
tell anybody anything like if you didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: buy off me you didn't know and uh now to
see all the brands that are popping up
[SPEAKER_06]: just because they didn't care or they
would advertise or whatever now they've
[SPEAKER_06]: got established brands years later yeah i
mean when i when i was young in chicago
[SPEAKER_05]: like there was only two or three people
that knew i grew and sometimes i would be
[SPEAKER_05]: at a party and off of one of those people
i would buy a full price eighth or quarter
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so that way when friends saw me with
the weed they knew where i got yeah that
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't get them on anything yeah yeah
yeah i didn't understand computers and so
[SPEAKER_05]: when overgrow and cannabis world and some
of those first forums came out i was
[SPEAKER_05]: terrified to post yeah because i didn't
know if a government agent could just like
[SPEAKER_05]: call me up and figure out like exactly
where i was posting from and where the
[SPEAKER_02]: computer was and i had so many good jokes
i could pull right now and i'm just not
[SPEAKER_06]: going to even medical licenses even
medical licenses canada like i thought
[SPEAKER_06]: that was a joke like they were just like
people were signing up to get rated right
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah yeah for sure when you could have
went out and got a license and been legal
[SPEAKER_06]: i just shut up and kept doing what i was
doing and i was the same with california i
[SPEAKER_02]: did not want to be on that i i thought
everybody was just eventually going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled i thought it was a big yeah you
guys are ridiculous like you don't see
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going on here yeah but you know it
it that's interesting too because when i
[SPEAKER_05]: first ended up in mendo i actually ended
up on a legal medical
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah that's pretty cool literally he shut
the program down and he burned all the
[SPEAKER_05]: files because he was like you're not going
to come in and raid a bunch of sick people
[SPEAKER_05]: nope i don't know who it is you don't know
who it is oops yeah yeah and so sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: there were cool people yeah a cool cop
that's never heard of that before that's
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy they i mean for a time in theory
they exist in theory yeah they do exist i
[SPEAKER_05]: mean they're humans like anybody else they
might be a preponderance to one side or
[SPEAKER_05]: another but i mean weren't you mentioning
earlier on the show that like you know you
[SPEAKER_05]: were in spain you were selling clones to
cops yeah i never feared the cops when i
[SPEAKER_04]: lived in spain um in canada it's a whole
different story when you ran into a cop
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of look all straight and proper
and pretend nothing's going on guilty
[SPEAKER_04]: until proven innocent and in spain yeah i
have no fear of the cops you could be you
[SPEAKER_04]: could walk up to them with smoking a joint
and uh report you know something i just
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't fear cops there um that would be
nice it's a whole different and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: your peers yeah that's a different culture
that's it that's a thing yeah as an
[SPEAKER_02]: american i often forget like and not even
just an american like where i'm from
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically is very cop heavy and
conservative so i feel he lives in the
[SPEAKER_02]: worst place in california the worst like
the worst we have tv shows about our
[SPEAKER_02]: police force being jackasses you know yeah
it's not good so like my my perspective is
[SPEAKER_02]: a little skewed on police that i i never
really have any positive outlook but i
[SPEAKER_02]: forget like yeah other places they are
your peers like it's not that same
[SPEAKER_04]: adversarial thing yeah when i was growing
up on on the prairies here in canada my
[SPEAKER_04]: parents they worked for the police they
like janitors and they get some guarding
[SPEAKER_04]: at the prison and my dad told me after
years of working with him he said one out
[SPEAKER_04]: of five he's a good guy he's there for the
right reason said the other four they're
[SPEAKER_04]: just people who want revenge on society
but one out of five is a good person there
[SPEAKER_04]: for the right reason so just hope you get
one of those one of those one out of five
[SPEAKER_05]: i mean if you if you get off having an
unreasonable amount of power off off of
[SPEAKER_05]: people in most situations that's not a bad
career for you yeah unfortunately it draws
[SPEAKER_05]: people with that bent you know yeah
exactly it does i mean spain has always
[SPEAKER_05]: been interesting to me because it's almost
like the only place in in like western
[SPEAKER_05]: europe that has a climate that's like
that's close to where i live to some
[SPEAKER_05]: degree you know uh when you look at the
map of how much sun europe gets versus how
[SPEAKER_05]: much sun america gets it's unbelievable uh
how much sunnier large parts of america
[SPEAKER_05]: are compared to canada or you know or
compared to europe you know um and so you
[SPEAKER_05]: know did you get to grow any any sati did
you get to was was spain did you get to do
[SPEAKER_05]: some outdoor there did you get to do some
gaps did you get to try yeah a lot of all
[SPEAKER_04]: the strings that i couldn't do all the
strings that i couldn't grow outdoors here
[SPEAKER_04]: in canada i was able to grow in spain and
oh wow up here we're around the 50th
[SPEAKER_04]: parallel here and when i lived in spain
we're around the 35th pretty much the same
[SPEAKER_04]: latitude as uh northern california like
san francisco where i live in spain and i
[SPEAKER_04]: was able to grow all my sati was that the
first thing that's the first thing i did
[SPEAKER_04]: all my island sweets my great blue hazes
my hawaiians first thing i did was planted
[SPEAKER_04]: those sativas and i a few big properties
there where i grow a bunch and then a few
[SPEAKER_04]: a few patches in the mountains and then i
give some questions on that because that's
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the that's the reason i brought it
up was that i've done a bunch inside and i
[SPEAKER_05]: you know i obviously live in an area where
i get to do a bunch of sungrown too um you
[SPEAKER_05]: were i would imagine you were primarily
indoor in canada for a long time right so
[SPEAKER_05]: then you go over to spain well you were
just talking about let's let's just focus
[SPEAKER_05]: on the stuff that you couldn't grow
outside in canada yeah but you grew it
[SPEAKER_05]: inside in where in in canada because
that's where that's where it could finish
[SPEAKER_05]: where there are strains of yours that did
things you didn't expect where there are
[SPEAKER_05]: things that when you've got to grow them
in the sunlight you found some differences
[SPEAKER_05]: or you found some things that really
surprised you you know because no not too
[SPEAKER_04]: much actually um maybe a little bit but i
had already been growing for about 12 13
[SPEAKER_04]: years before i moved to spain um so i kind
of had a good feel for how my uh varieties
[SPEAKER_04]: performed in different situations and
sometimes they wouldn't uh grow outdoors
[SPEAKER_04]: on the island but i always had greenhouses
so i had a good idea so of what what kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of what's going to express itself in uh in
the selection but uh yeah did you see
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like notably different over there
like is that what we're trying to get at
[SPEAKER_05]: like the expressions like from yeah like
i'll give you a couple examples so like
[SPEAKER_05]: the chem family that i run and some
different stuff like that if you grow it
[SPEAKER_05]: inside it grows a certain way if you grow
it outdoors you'll get hot pink to magenta
[SPEAKER_05]: hairs on it quite a bit that i'll never
ever see inside but then sometimes if you
[SPEAKER_05]: grow it in the full sun you'll get a leafy
afghan mess where if i grow it like say
[SPEAKER_05]: under like woven poly that takes out some
of the uv and i grow it smaller like in a
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse i'll get like a more indoor
expression um yeah you know i noticed that
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got my romulan um during my romulan
yeah and the time warp as well uh outdoors
[SPEAKER_04]: in spain um a lot of the red hairs would
come out on the romulan that i never seen
[SPEAKER_04]: indoors or even in the greenhouse in
canada sure that the red hairs in spain
[SPEAKER_04]: just were popping out it was it was
beautiful beautiful looking plant uh yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: other than that not not a big difference
uh in most strains interesting because i
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like indoor you can have you have
control over everything but the light the
[SPEAKER_05]: you know there's not a better light that
i've experienced than the sun i've tried
[SPEAKER_05]: all kinds of different combinations and
mixed light inside and you can kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: approximate it but like it's weird like i
would bring a lot of my strains um and
[SPEAKER_05]: like some old euros and stuff like that
like neville and shanti and some old guys
[SPEAKER_05]: actually told me this where they were like
if you want to keep old moms healthy try
[SPEAKER_05]: to give them three or four months a year
of sunlight you know and i would take my
[SPEAKER_05]: plants in february or march and i would
put them into a greenhouse and i would
[SPEAKER_05]: think they looked pretty healthy and then
after about a month of being outside i'd
[SPEAKER_05]: be like man these things are banging these
things are really happy these plants are
[SPEAKER_05]: really growing well and so there's
something about like just that full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum where it has all the spectrums in
spades i will say indoor i indoor i can
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of do the same kind of trick though
with the revege like a sim not maybe not
[SPEAKER_02]: as as vigorous because it's not the
sunlight now obviously plants prefer the
[SPEAKER_02]: sunlight because of the spectrum so you
can get like that little bit of a vigorous
[SPEAKER_02]: re-jump on plants with the revege uh at
least i found like especially for breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff old stock um old mom stock a
revege does wonders yeah yeah there's
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing nothing better than the sun so
outdoor guys i mean it's just it's one of
[SPEAKER_05]: those things where you know the only
reason why i asked is because if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: stuck up there not stuck but if you're in
northern like you know there's certain
[SPEAKER_05]: sativas there's certain things that like
even for my area like it doesn't stay nice
[SPEAKER_05]: into december i can't i can't in my
environment you know like i can't grow
[SPEAKER_05]: certain equatorial stuff and get away with
it it just doesn't finish and so then
[SPEAKER_05]: there's these there's these things where
it's like the only thing i've ever
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced with them is growing them
inside yeah because i can't take a 16 20
[SPEAKER_05]: weaker and see what it does in a
greenhouse yeah unless i've got added
[SPEAKER_05]: light mad heat and all these different
things that we typically don't around you
[SPEAKER_05]: know so i was just curious if you like
when he went there did he get to see
[SPEAKER_05]: different things from strains that like
especially when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: some of these like 16 week mexicans and
different things that you're crossing if
[SPEAKER_05]: you got to play around with those more
because the weather was just nicer well i
[SPEAKER_04]: uh i really like playing with my
grapefruit haze and my island sweets come
[SPEAKER_04]: those are the two strains that i can never
finish properly in canada and down there i
[SPEAKER_04]: was growing monster monster plants uh like
four or five pounds of plant and just that
[SPEAKER_04]: that lemony hazy flavor um that was and
just branches and branches of weight um it
[SPEAKER_04]: just can't and it they did actually grow a
lot a bit of a different structure than
[SPEAKER_04]: indoors they're a lot branchier the both
both of those strains um indoors maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: it's because i growing technique indoors
it can't keep the plants close am i
[SPEAKER_06]: growing medium even like your medium is so
much different when you're outside for the
[SPEAKER_06]: most part too right you're not just
growing in pete yeah well actually i
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't do most of my plants were growing
in containers so um yeah so yeah the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: was pretty similar um again yeah other
than that yeah what was the island sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk again real quick what's that the
island sweet skunk what was that one again
[SPEAKER_04]: um that was selected from uh breeder
steve's uh sweet skunk but what was his
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet skunk do we remember or did we not
know um nobody really knows i think um you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to ask uh red or uh or steve about
that red would probably be the best uh
[SPEAKER_04]: source of info i may have
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm pretty sure that's what it is if i'm
remembering it wrong but if i remember
[SPEAKER_05]: correctly that's what red thought it was
some nl5 haze and it maybe at some point
[SPEAKER_05]: was added into grit got grapefruit or
something like that added to it um and
[SPEAKER_05]: then and then he was saying that there was
a difference talking about mark emery
[SPEAKER_05]: again there was a difference between the
original sweet skunk and then people gave
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds to mark and he was and he he added
the island and he and he sold some
[SPEAKER_05]: different weird hybrids of it and stuff
like that i i added the island i added the
[SPEAKER_04]: island yeah we when uh when mark uh when
mike and i started federation um we had a
[SPEAKER_04]: clone of the island sweet skunk or the
sweet skunk that was going around the city
[SPEAKER_04]: we got a cut we made our own cross with it
and what is island sweet skunk instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet yeah but you kind of had to because
steve did not want you using his fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: name right like steve's like oh no no he
didn't like that very much yeah but but i
[SPEAKER_04]: was trying to give him give him credit for
it he didn't like that for sure yeah back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the day i i get it in the beginning i
was that way too and people would knock
[SPEAKER_04]: off my strain and just yeah rename it kind
of bugged me a bit in the first years but
[SPEAKER_04]: nowadays like yeah everybody this far in
this far in it's like you're growing with
[SPEAKER_04]: good genetics somebody is copying you it's
a it's a compliment it's not a rip off yes
[SPEAKER_05]: that's where i am now so i always felt
like a compliment was somebody would take
[SPEAKER_05]: your strain and grow it themselves i
almost thought a bigger compliment was
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody would take your strain grow it
themselves rename it as something else so
[SPEAKER_05]: they would get the credit for it if it was
good enough you know because every single
[SPEAKER_05]: person that's if you never want anyone to
grow your strains then you can't have a
[SPEAKER_05]: seed company you can't let them out you
can't have friends do it because that's
[SPEAKER_05]: the most classic thing in weed is people
are going to take it and they're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: do what they want with it always they're
going to buy your stuff yeah it's it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just the most i mean you know i uh you
know neville you know neville got hella
[SPEAKER_05]: bitter because he thought 90 percent of
the amsterdam scene was people just buying
[SPEAKER_05]: and biting his seed work yeah he did and
then you know and then you don't get lube
[SPEAKER_05]: for it but that's the that and that i
think honestly that's also what led to a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of seed companies like never wanting
to reveal what was in their actions
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the way she goes that's the way it
works did you have anything else on your
[SPEAKER_02]: list that you wanted to get in because
we're like two hours in i mean if there's
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else you had written down that
you wanted to get in this episode a heck
[SPEAKER_04]: of a lot um just to uh let the people know
we have some good outdoor strains whether
[SPEAKER_04]: they're auto flower or feminized uh
springtime's coming up so uh get your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds now absolutely and what what's your
website where work where's the best
[SPEAKER_04]: retailer to get them uh next generation
seed company dot com awesome we have very
[SPEAKER_04]: few uh other resellers right now um
because we do a lot of bulk sales to other
[SPEAKER_04]: companies um and lps and big farmers in
the states so people are looking for bulk
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds we have that or we just have packs
as well so and you mentioned you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: phone number too that people can call
that's not super common um what's the
[SPEAKER_04]: number yeah um it's i believe i sent you a
text uh i can look it up in one second
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a canadian number is it the one that
you texted me from i let's give me one
[SPEAKER_04]: second here um yeah it's taylor when you
call the phone number on our website it's
[SPEAKER_04]: uh my partner taylor um and he'll uh he
he's great talking to people he'll
[SPEAKER_04]: probably throw you something free if you
give him a call but it's uh yeah one seven
[SPEAKER_04]: eight zero one seven eight zero seven
eight two seven eight zero four okay there
[SPEAKER_02]: you go anybody you want to get your
canadian seeds and maybe maybe you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: even in canada maybe maybe you're in the u
.s and you're in a climate that needs that
[SPEAKER_02]: that mold resistance it's awesome stuff um
you know there's all the hype out there
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there's the solid stuff that's
been around forever so don't uh don't buy
[SPEAKER_02]: the hype anyways not so you want to get
anything else i just always like talking
[SPEAKER_05]: weed with people so i'm always
appreciative of people's time yeah we
[SPEAKER_02]: loved having you guys yeah and we need to
do a hash episode so you know you're
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome back on bro like we need to get a
