[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_03]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other, any other grows you want to
highlight, Kristen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other hacks that you found interesting
or better or worse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's the other side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really ask you guys if there were
things that like you really didn't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of you did mention that,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I, it's something I didn't,
something I didn't like, but was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like market-wise really good was
the Rainbow Sys S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it produced like crazy, super pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had like just a slight knuckle like
structure to the flower, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that, you know, the market seems
to go for is the like knuckly buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was potent as shit,
but the quality of the smoke was just not
[SPEAKER_01]: so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it, and I mean, it's cookies
based, you know, that's one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, there's no denying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I w I will say that if there are,
there are bigger spots out here,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys who are just, you know, like running,
you know, buying, you know, you Hall's
[SPEAKER_01]: worth of Oakey cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like running them just for the market
out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some of those dudes are
getting it, uh, you know, go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would rather see that in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause at least it works and it's something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe so the, the next part of this
chat was meant to be about what you've
[SPEAKER_02]: found, but like I said earlier,
it's, it's kind of impossible to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about what you've grown without talking
about what you found.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys already covered some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe what we can do instead for this next
part is actually talk about one thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned earlier, things you didn't like,
uh, that's one thing, but also maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons you've learned and that can,
that can, that could relate to both what
[SPEAKER_02]: you've grown, but also like how you've
grown things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe have, have a think about what
hasn't gone so well and what you've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned, uh, from both the point of view
of the genetics and the point of view of
[SPEAKER_02]: your growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Sean, maybe we'll bring it back to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so things that I guess I did not
enjoy, um, most, um, I grew out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: dominion stuff early, like back in like
2018, 2019 or so I didn't really find
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that accent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you just say, would you just say
about VA boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really enjoy much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it just was just like a lot of just
citrus, you know, like any, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the screaming Eagle crosses and,
um, like the local skunks, I grew out some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those and it was just, you know,
citrus and, and not really like what he
[SPEAKER_00]: said was on described as on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, um, the only one that was like
kinda, um, good was the, the one like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the crossroad cam, um, whatever it's
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do that was the only one that was like
pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but all the other ones, you know,
it was like, they yielded well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was just like a lot of citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess the sangria punch,
the sangria punch was actually good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was, it was like killer queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, killer queen screaming Eagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was like a fruit punch pheno in
there and, and that just tasted really
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, bro, it was a, I think they had the
lone star cut a killer queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that one, that one was by far my
favorite of, uh, any of the ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, anything I grew up by him and it was
like, um, had like this fruit punch pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had one that was just like
Clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasting and stuff that I had a friend
that, uh, really loved and I gave him kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rest of the seeds of the pack and
he popped those and, and ran that for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept a cut that he really loved of just
kind of like the, the citrus phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I preferred the fruit punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was like a really nice,
um, kind of more electric high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and really long lasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other ones I didn't really
like the, the LA lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I did grow out for the LA,
uh, uh, chem D's and I just didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: find anything I was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was growing them alongside,
um, the blue sours, the appy F threes,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, electric Boogaloo appy, which I forgot
to mention earlier, um, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the appy F threes with this,
like the, the couple of phenos I found
[SPEAKER_00]: that were like this chem mango funk that
was just really, um, mouth coating and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, it was like,
I'd rather have to have this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like a chem, you know,
it's got the chem taste and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel phenos were all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then three of the four were just short
stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of the LA chem D and, and,
you know, I, I may not have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I ever ran them from clone and ran them
again, I caught probably could have did
[SPEAKER_00]: better with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also, it wasn't, I didn't really
find anything I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the potency wasn't, you know,
the best thing, you know, the blue sours
[SPEAKER_00]: had better potency and some of the phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The appy, the appy F the appies were,
were, were really good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the electric Boogaloo appy,
it was just, I, they were the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that were my least favorite of
what else was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not saying like it was bad,
but just if everything else I was going,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're my least favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, other than that, yeah, I guess that's
kind of, it's kind of about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that I haven't really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's definitely some other ones
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't, um, think of it at the top
of my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I realized that my question is kind
of, it's a bit baity in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe if, if some of you are not
comfortable naming specific things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't like for various reasons,
you can just maybe tell us in general what
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't like about it without naming
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I could, I could, uh, also,
uh, hefe's, um, sensei star like F threes
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's, there's another one
that's, uh, a banana, a banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: a banana that I'm not going to name,
but it was just like this really just
[SPEAKER_00]: boring, just bubble gum, turpentine,
you know, just all of them were just
[SPEAKER_00]: boring, like, uh, citrusy, um,
turpentine or bubble gum, turpentine,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like super boring yielded well and
looked pretty though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one, which one was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was a banana tie, a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not going to name noted noted
that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I mean, it yielded well and
was pretty and like, uh, commercial wise
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything is probably good,
but like just the, the, what I found it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't what I was hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I was kind of, you know,
told it was supposed to be more juicy
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and not, not like turpentine and
bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, like, and that the
bubble gum, turpentine to me is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most boring, you know, like,
well, no, it was like, I can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it the best, but it's got like
that bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes to like this weird,
like weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not, it does doesn't do it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to make it move, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to make it move for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't really what I was,
was, was trying to find, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it smokes decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I guess that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just not my cup of tea,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I a bit awkward, but I'm going to
have to dip for another meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Matt's going to take over and yeah,
thanks again, you guys for, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: joining us, but yeah, I will catch you
guys soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea they had grinder at the
North Pole where he's from anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think where are we at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, uh, Kyle, did you go over yours?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, but, uh, I was just thinking of
what I could, uh, what, uh, which ones I
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so there was actually one,
uh, which I was really looking forward to
[SPEAKER_06]: was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chocolata, which was great pie and
chocolate tie from Canorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that actually, uh, were kind of
okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that the high was just,
if they were all, um, it was almost like
[SPEAKER_06]: you grew them too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: The high was just born.
[SPEAKER_06]: Warring just bland.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like, well, you know,
as you got stoned, but that was it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was almost like they were, you
overgrown, you know, you grew them too
[SPEAKER_06]: long.
[SPEAKER_06]: You type of thing every single time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then lessons would definitely be
the Isaac Hayes and that's from dampering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, because yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, yeah, I grew those inside and I
definitely got some jungly type stuff and
[SPEAKER_06]: boy, and I also grow tents in the garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of deal with outside environment
type stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So during the summer, when it gets in
Cali, it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it was, they just, they didn't,
they never stopped.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were in one gallons and I,
they, without, with the bends,
[SPEAKER_06]: they probably would have been 12 feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they were there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the lights and two of them were like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so that was definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely learned a lot there and
reset everything and, uh, I haven't had
[SPEAKER_06]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other ones weren't, weren't finishing as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it was definitely the heat,
uh, because I run stuff hot anyway with
[SPEAKER_06]: Tilo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so yeah, I think that was,
so it definitely, that was a lesson,
[SPEAKER_06]: a big lesson right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I mean, for why I had to completely
reset.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember even some, some very nice
people hit me up on the DMs are like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey man, your stuff's not looking too
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to us, Kid Willie and Denali.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, uh, yeah, I grew the same,
uh, banana tie, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, uh, Sean did and mine were remade
tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that wasn't the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up throwing them, uh, the jars
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were, they weren't, uh, yeah,
I don't like tangy citrus is definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: not my thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will actually, I think, uh,
part of that other, uh, the part of the,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, banana tie, it actually is more of the
citrus part.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what I got,
but yeah, it was really weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'm not a tangy fan either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, uh, yeah, and that's about it
for, I can't really think of too many,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cause I just, I, most of them,
when I grow, I know, uh, I do random
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of stuff, sometimes I'm not
really looking, I'm just looking to learn,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, stuff type of thing, especially since
I'm newer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I just want to see, uh, stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do S ones especially just to get a
look under the hood type thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives you a lot of really good days,
especially S ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: From, from a reliable source, it gives
you, uh, data points.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you can speak on things more
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you get a much better
understanding of traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's probably it for lessons and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can think of her out the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from here, we're going to move on to
what else you're looking for the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Desired strains and traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, we're going to have you guys do,
you know, one after the other,
[SPEAKER_03]: each growers shares what strains they are
interested in growing out next,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then, uh, discuss specific traits
you're looking for, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I know I think later on we were
going to talk about like things we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing next or whatever, but,
um, some of the things I am excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to try and look for like certain
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so sleep disturbance, the,
the P 91, um, S one, uh, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be running that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just like the discord and everyone,
everyone talking about the P 91 S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I'm just really interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, you know, kind of see what
that's about and hopefully, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: get some phenos that are kind of more
leaning that, um, but just kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just get more, more markers on
the blue dream crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm going to, I got a decent amount
of those that I want to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I ran the, the Monterey Bay dreams,
which I really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I really liked the Santa Cruz
rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of want to get through more of
those, see more blue dream, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, um, and then as well as,
uh, the electric Boogaloo dog shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like I got that and, and blue dream
have, uh, more of the, uh, electric
[SPEAKER_00]: Boogaloo happy to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the electric Boogaloo,
um, mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I really want to look through
those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the ones I got, which I think I
got like the Kendi mango, um, green crack
[SPEAKER_03]: ones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, you know, kind of want to see
both, uh, parents in there get,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, cause I haven't really grown any,
uh, true hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, get some experience of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, see things and also just, you know,
try and find some really nice electric,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, work weed, um, which would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, um, I have some of,
uh, Lucia's, uh, souring 16 destroyer that
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to look through and just
find some, just really something really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique, um, like terpene profile and,
and, and high wise, um, just something
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, maybe a little bit trippy,
um, and, and just the description that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of the siren 16 being kind of
like a blueberry OG wonderful too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like blueberry muffin cereal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real berry in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping to find something with like that
kind of terpene profile with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the destroyer effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure the souring effect,
uh, 16 effects are really great as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also his, um, Malibu pure
Kush, uh, a five back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to check those out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just, you know, grow some more,
uh, hay stuff, stuff that's like more
[SPEAKER_00]: unique, um, not really what other people
are necessarily growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a bunch of people are about to
start going into high and lonesome,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, may haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everyone should that there's going
to be a bunch of really cool stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, that's what I would kind
of go to first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say, you know, if you have the space
and time and everything, um, just no
[SPEAKER_00]: unique versus like, you can go and get
chems and, and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily OGs as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find some OG hybrids here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like everyone's growing cookies
and chem stuff and sour this and sour
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, you know, I'm trying to like not
keep growing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out a lot of sour hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, and, and diesel hybrids in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just kind of sick of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's massive hit or miss in those,
um, wasted so much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like, no, yeah, just to find
the final three, I ran of, of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sour skunk dog, the blue sour and the
happy diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally found those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, all right, like those
are the only ones I'm going to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: through and look through if, um,
when I do, um, but yeah, just wasting
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like chase certain things,
um, that I felt worth, were worth chasing
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you know, you, you live and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'm just trying to grow some more
unique stuff, um, get some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: experience growing more longer flowering
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see different structures, um,
and just learn different techniques from
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing these structures on how to apply
them, make them work for, um, my space
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just, you know, kind of love
experimenting and just plants in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just seeing how everything grows and
it's growth structures, um, the different
[SPEAKER_00]: smells that produces, um, it's,
uh, like just the strength, some of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the branches can get to, and I,
you know, I enjoyed training at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be fun with the hazes and
everything when they start stretching to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what I can do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I, I'm just trying to see as
many things as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I try and run plants that have the
same parents at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it is going to put out the father,
like there, it's either going to be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of plants that are all the same
fathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then just so I can, you know,
notice those traits easier where I could
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, well, that line has this,
and then that line also has this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same father chances are it could be
the father.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just kind of just narrow it down
and just learn a little different traits
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little like nuances of each little plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really great way to do it,
to understand a line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the haze lines, like, you know,
people always say like, Oh, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow this haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to grow this PIF, you know,
like all that stuff, but really that mango
[SPEAKER_03]: haze line, one of the best, uh,
that Neville's haze to me and in trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: find a good Neville's haze now is very
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, mango haze, Neville's haze are the
cream of the crop for hazes that are like,
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially viable in the sense that most
people in generally speaking, most people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are into weed will smoke them and
like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're not so airy and fluffy again,
generally speaking, cause they're in there
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're, they're going to look weird
in a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of that stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, uh, that's probably about it
of, of what I'm looking forward to and
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of, what I'm exactly looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's more, you know, like trying to
see different traits in certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, things and just gain experience and
also, you know, find some kind of unique
[SPEAKER_00]: racy high that, um, will also be good for,
you know, aches and pains, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, won't make me too stupid to work,
but will keep me alert.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, screw what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, right now I have, uh,
at week four, I have the skylines from H
[SPEAKER_01]: and L.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shoreline by Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then I just flipped some of
the, uh, garbage clouds from pack the
[SPEAKER_01]: shoreline by Santa Cruz blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way to see the shoreline
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, yeah, that was your thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I kind of, I was a little bit,
uh, uh, annoying about it, but no,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no, like that was your chase
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, yeah, I mean, I've been,
that was like the weed that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, it wasn't the first really good weed
that I had, but it was the first really
[SPEAKER_01]: good way that I had that made me stop
buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'll just spend 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's so, and I've, I've been like
trying to get ahold of a cut and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, there's been a total fucking
newb about it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally I did end up getting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and God damn, is it hard to fucking
like hit right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wiley cut bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just looking at it, it looks fucking,
yeah, it looks like it would be very hard
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow consistently to nail every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's also, you know,
like not only is it hard, but like the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the better you grow the flowers,
at least from how I've been doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better that I get the flowers to set
the worst the flavor is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it, it just, it's not like it
doesn't last very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of those two lines, I'm hoping to
find something that's a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to nail that has improvements on like
flavor and you know, maybe a weird twist
[SPEAKER_01]: to the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The happy one sounds like a good,
good hold to climb down for that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what I'm hoping that in,
you know, the uh, I ran the wet dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my buddy down here, Donnie,
he ran, uh, the dream killers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems, I don't know that that blue
dream note in there really like carries a
[SPEAKER_01]: quality factor to it in this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love blue tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, but like, again, I got to qualify
that most people, like when you say you
[SPEAKER_03]: love blue dreams are like, oh,
I hate that shit because they never got to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke the cut that we all grew back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and, and, or the, if they did,
it probably wasn't grown that well,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and some people's, you know,
chemistry doesn't line up with,
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love that cut the high,
the quality, um, even the flavor,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, even though it's like a Terpeneleon
kind of base, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I was one of those people who hated
on blue dream for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause yeah, you know, me and my buddies
back in the day sold a lot of very bad
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dreams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it just like poured into here for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the actual, you know, like actually
well done blue dream stuff is pretty good,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like killer killer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of other shoreline hybrids
also, um, the shoreline by coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: By Vietnam black from H and L the
shoreline by mango Hayes, uh, also from H
[SPEAKER_01]: and L and the shoreline by a five back
cross from Lush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and he's in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more like looking for, you know,
just that's more of like an adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm looking for weird new,
you know, like stuff that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully it's just super radically
different than.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great place to start for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that, is that about it for you on that
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm like, if there was some other
blue bonnet, I, I stay steady popping blue
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get stuck with it for a reason,
you know, like it's very hard to find a,
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that breeds true in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that reliably passes traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, it's just one of those things
where even as it, from a breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, I don't even really think
about it from a customer perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about it from a breeding
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's just really, really hard to nail
that a perfect male that I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I still haven't really moved on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going through the hybrids now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, probably going to reproduce
bubble Berry this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how that goes though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle, what you got?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, uh, see, I'm looking forward to,
uh, going through the third round of
[SPEAKER_06]: these, uh, chocolate tie skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: The final selections.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause, uh, yeah, now it's just narrowing
it down to basic, you know, which ones
[SPEAKER_06]: give me the highest basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you definitely got that, that funk,
the earthy funk in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the ones that I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some other ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, one was we were talking about that on
the discord the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually, uh, dryer sheets,
but more of a downy downy, like a fabric
[SPEAKER_06]: softener, maybe not dryer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, uh, the high was okay on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the, the, the, the definitely
not like the, that, that armpit funk that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you said the skittles cube to
cube.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, then see what else I got coming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some, uh, blue dream, uh,
S ones, um, uh, Santa Cruz work wrecks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, see what else saw some black poison
from the rev.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that was, or those are really looking
forward to, because, uh, I ended up
[SPEAKER_06]: finding out, uh, it was an older pack and,
uh, I recently got ahold of him through
[SPEAKER_06]: email and, uh, he said, uh, he doesn't
even recognize them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's pretty sure those are F ones based
on, you know, I sent him a leaf picture
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'll probably do something with
those just to make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, because I would definitely want to
look through F twos of those, because that
[SPEAKER_06]: has, uh, his own Vietnam black.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it also has his, uh, old school
Durbin, uh, what he calls Durbin poison
[SPEAKER_06]: bros.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, and then it has Nebu black Russian
in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that definitely would,
that sounds pretty good to me,
[SPEAKER_06]: man, to look through a little bit of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that line, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I grew so much black Russian stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unreal, uh, throughout my career.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like early on I focused like I do with
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like a good seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I focused on black Russian stuff and
blackberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, see, I got some, uh, super several
Hayes S ones tribute from, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: old song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and then, uh, so much, uh,
cherry Malawi's F threes from the rev two.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's basically what I got coming up
for quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just trying to get through all those.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we'll get down to experimental
techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun, dun, dun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like anything you guys are trying to
incorporate, um, different techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Technologies, um, and the potential risk
benefit, you know, ratios, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, this isn't going to apply to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with me, I just stick with a shit
like haven't ever tried LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know it's not going to be for
everyone, but, um, if any of you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about this, feel free to speak up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if there's anything that you've been
incorporating new, then maybe you haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise, or, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Free shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, about the only thing new that I've
been doing the past, uh, probably like a
[SPEAKER_01]: year or so has been adding, um,
hydrogen peroxide into the bottom of my
[SPEAKER_01]: clone trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been digging that, but like grow
wise, nah, I've kind of stuck in my ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel you there, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean, you got anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm pretty much stuck in my ways grow
wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have thought, you know, about trying a
cocoa and, you know, doing that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit or try a little bit of more like
Synganic, um, approach, but man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm busy with work and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, I'm just, you know,
stuck in my ways, not really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: venture out until I have a little bit more
space where I can, uh, have like an
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental, um, area and then have,
you know, kind of, uh, a main flower spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, yeah, when I have some more
space, then that's probably when I'll try
[SPEAKER_00]: out some more new things, but nothing
really like new, new techniques or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's like cutting age or
anything like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle, you got anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause, uh, I was just waiting for the new,
you know, rev book, you know, make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: go, go pick that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely go buy that book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, there's a forward, it's written by
probably by the most handsome,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, seed maker ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pick a stick, check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, I was waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just do, uh, I was just waiting for
more of the, um, little additions that he
[SPEAKER_06]: does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause, uh, after that reset, I haven't
been doing, I was just doing kind of plain
[SPEAKER_06]: water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I've been, I just was waiting to
now he's kind of, I think he's finished up
[SPEAKER_06]: with kind of his experiment type stuff
that where he's confident, I think where
[SPEAKER_06]: he's got his grow where he wants it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just waiting, kind of waiting for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So real quick, Kyle, do either of us that,
you know, I've had the 1979 calendar or is
[SPEAKER_03]: that one of the ones that was missing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, which one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because actually I, what I'm finding out
is there is actually the cannabis calendar
[SPEAKER_06]: started 73 and those are not the
brotherhood of eternal love ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this one's the, um, since a Mia one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that one, that one is from KO.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from who?
[SPEAKER_06]: The KO.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, that's the sense of me and
techniques.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I have that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally got it on the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are, and then there is other ones of
those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's two other ones of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense that that would be chaos
then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those again, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pictures are some of this ones that
are in the book, the sense of me,
[SPEAKER_06]: a technique.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're, they're, they're just bigger,
which is, is a really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cool calendar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually I got picked up a few,
uh, just got another one too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, I posted the photo, the cover that
I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: I opened up the package.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a, the cultivators 77,
uh, calendar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, these are, I've been picking up a lot
of different ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a normal 76 one, which has a double
cover.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's missing two things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of weird, I've been finding a
lot of crazy ones, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scanning them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all in, they're all in discord.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, for, for people who don't know,
we have stuff like that in the discord,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, like a lot of these old calendars have
a lot of the old, I mean, pictures of the
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, like the Acapulco gold,
the Panama red, um, all of our Hawkins
[SPEAKER_03]: Guerrero and stuff that like we hear about
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, maybe you'll see Barney's farm
say they sell, um, but that's not really
[SPEAKER_03]: the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have point of origin, like time of
origin pictures and to be able to look at
[SPEAKER_03]: those, be able to get whatever,
you know, visual, data points and traits
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can see, um, is super helpful,
especially when they describe it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, uh, word for word,
like, um, are, are the connoisseur used to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like this, the 79 has a,
uh, has some great, uh, pictures of
[SPEAKER_06]: Columbia in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I noticed is they didn't have a
lot of serrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, that's what I took away from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I don't know what they did to it,
but they were going to, I don't think they
[SPEAKER_06]: would have just, you know, spend a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were trying to hide it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in those pictures, they're all
tied down and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think they would have been
cutting off serrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I just, that's one thing I took
away from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think someone on the show before was
saying that Columbia was also rated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for the aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I just nerd out on like,
I just, just saw it pop up on eBay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes a keeper for you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, Sean, this is kind of a rough,
I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of an on the spot question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what makes a keeper for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I do like to pick, um, based off of
structure, but then also, um, so structure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, how, how quickly it'll
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I usually don't like things that are
too slow and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, you know, be able to do like a,
if I'm doing like a quick seed run,
[SPEAKER_00]: do like four to six weeks, um,
and then be good enough to run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things that from seed, if I'm just
trying to do like a quick, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: run to see what, see what they're about,
uh, you know, we'll take, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: two months or, or so the veg and,
and even running from clone may,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, take, um, double the time than
it would then the ones that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are much quicker in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so I do like things that grow a
bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the plants that like to
support themselves, um, not much staking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously there are ones that,
um, you need to stake and, and they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're amazing plants and it,
that's just something you have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do like, um, a more sturdy
structure that is vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then, um, yields is not
necessarily the most important thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes it's nice, but I'd rather
have the, the flavor translate fully and
[SPEAKER_00]: be mouth coding as long and then as long,
and then as well as have, um, the effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, be what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whether it's, it's something for,
for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytime, um, to have at work or,
or just, you know, nighttime, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: try and just chill, relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe just, you know, completely take
the mind off of things and, and for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just forget and be able to zone
out and, and get some good sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so really those are kind of the
parameters I'm kind of selecting off of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, mostly effects, uh, being number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effects and then flavor and then
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there have been plants that were more
floppy that I really do love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do, you know, prefer plants that
have a little bit more sturdy structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't necessarily have to stake or,
um, trellis too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I will trellis or stake those
heavily if, you know, if needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the original sin, um, some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Needed more heavier stinking and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I love those, um,
that the appy diesels, those were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: like pretty, pretty sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they didn't need much staking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The couple of Finos I really liked,
um, and they got really like nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: big and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I, I love plants,
you know, just the flavor, the flay and it
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be mouth coating, um, if I'm going
to keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the flavor wise, um, so many,
so many jokes I'm holding back right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be, uh, you're going
to put it on the soundboard in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, effects and then,
you know, flavor and, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the structure after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, screw.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your definition of a keeper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've been really, it's just more,
it's the stuff that I want to smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause I only smoke like what I
grow and what my friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in our little group down here grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I guess to, to kind of use a
phrase that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That locals said, um, I like weed with
character, like, so whether that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the only stuff that I really
don't like is citrus types, honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: like everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if, if it's good, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came into the syndicate with a lot of
like, I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just through like growing and
like trying my friends who were grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found good types of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't use to like fruit types,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but if it's good, it's good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Kyle, what makes a keeper for
you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, pretty much everything that Sean said,
basically, I mean, defect, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, taste, uh, then structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, if it's going to be a
pain in my ass, uh, over time,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, definitely don't want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I noticed that her stuff,
especially clones after about a year and a
[SPEAKER_06]: half to that's when they start getting
kind of funky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's usually when I've already
ran about twice by then usually,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, cause I don't usually, I don't run
seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run everything from, uh, cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so yeah, that, that'd be the,
for me, what it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you guys want to give any examples
of any keepers that you have, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys have already done
that or not, like trying to think back
[SPEAKER_03]: into our conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, mine would just be at the banana
tie.
[SPEAKER_06]: So banana has it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Sean, what do you got currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have none, but of, of what,
uh, just because of the work being done
[SPEAKER_00]: and not being able to keep things,
but what I'm going to go back through,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to look for keepers that I already
know off hand are going to be Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_00]: rec, um, he be happy that the electric
blue happy, um, and then original sin and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the Appalachian diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do want to go back into the
blue resin to look through that line more
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some phenomenal plants in
that, um, that I, that I need to just go
[SPEAKER_00]: back through and, and do a larger pop and
try and find the one I want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some wild testing plants in that
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've told people before, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it doesn't really stick, but yeah,
like a anomalous, anomalously wildly
[SPEAKER_03]: testing plants in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that Kush cut from resin line was just
something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one that was like blueberry cotton
candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, and then maybe like a
little bit of earthiness on the backend
[SPEAKER_00]: that was really, really good, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you hit, once you hit real blueberry,
like the actually taste that smells like
[SPEAKER_03]: it, no going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you screw?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I hold onto a lot of things right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's some stuff that,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I who knows how many years I'll hold onto
onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like, cause I, the way I see it,
if I find something that fulfills that
[SPEAKER_01]: like same role and is better, then I'll
just keep that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like I have, uh,
I went through, so for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I have a Tuscan leather, uh,
number one that my buddy, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: then my buddy popped and, uh, it's kind of
citrusy, but I guess, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's like a, it's super complex
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when I, when I ran the,
uh, death in Venice, it was pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, um, type of smells and flavors
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just way worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, same with the effects and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, like right now I'm holding on
triangle choke is something that I'm loved
[SPEAKER_01]: to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been, I don't think I'll be
dropping that one, um, anytime soon,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I do want to go through four
more packs of it to see if, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if I found that out of two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could find a better version of it,
hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with, uh, the chem sis S one by blue
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I saw the potential in it and like,
don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the cut that I hold onto is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just, the earthiness really kind of
like comes in full force at the end and
[SPEAKER_01]: bullying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry and like the nasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in, in that blueberry, there is
earthiness in some of those expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's everything I've tried breeding
away from because it is so strong in DJ's
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just the one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it can overpower the berry part to
where you just kind of like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell the berry, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the ones that I always try to
breed away from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you cross it to something like
chem D that also has earthiness to it or
[SPEAKER_03]: chem, the chem sis S one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is like a, um, very similar to chem
D and it's a cannabinoid scent expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that, that earthiness is
definitely in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm actually seeing that in the,
uh, the bubble berry that I'm,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have at week four right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like moldy blueberries, not like yay
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like a lot of earthiness in it
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot, like a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be very hard to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Against, uh, very dominant, very,
very dominant type of strain when you
[SPEAKER_03]: cross to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we should go to the keepers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You already said Benanti, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Benanti for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's uh, that's the one I found.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's something else, uh,
yeah, I'll keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything, any of you guys want to
say like, you know, you've seen these
[SPEAKER_03]: episodes forever, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, is there, is there anything you guys
want to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the voice, you know, if you could
have inserted anything in any episode that
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd want to tell people, uh,
feel free to now Sean, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say go and grab the mango hay
stuff and run and run some unique stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I, I guess it's kind of said
every show, but you know, don't keep
[SPEAKER_00]: running what everyone else is running,
do something unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that's, that's probably
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a cheap bath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, screw what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, I guess it's something we're
going to cover over, uh, later,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the whole clone chasing game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I chased one thing for 16 years
before getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm ready to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm way more excited about the
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's stuff that y'all can find in
seed is if you choose the right seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I totally get, if you're popping
funky shit and just kind of like getting
[SPEAKER_01]: a, you know, mids roller coaster,
then it doesn't seem like it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, that's all you'll need to
elevate your grow, but not just get legit
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, grow it like a normal person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, you know, do a bunch of weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we, we see some people come in
talking about and you'll, you'll do all
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clone chasing games.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that with HP 13 forever,
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the hybrids are so much better than
the clone, but it was because like back
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was young, read the can of Bible
and it was like, Oh, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course I'm like, Oh, this is the one
that's the one I'm going to chase that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody was chasing it and nobody
would give it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you finally get it all these
years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Oh, that's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's like, it's, it is the difference
between elite clones and your own keepers
[SPEAKER_03]: and being able to run through seeds
teaches you a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the people that are selecting a lot
of these quote unquote elite clones are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it from like one or two seeds in a
pop in a closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it's just how well they hype it,
who they're friends are that they pass it
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes the difference between an
elite versus your own keeper, in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of you guys have
opinions on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're there, you know, you have no
idea how high the likelihood that they
[SPEAKER_01]: picked that one over, you know,
a sibling because of the marketability or
[SPEAKER_01]: the bag, you know, like stuff that you
might not care about as, as a factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, do you guys have any
opinions on elite clones versus your own
[SPEAKER_03]: keepers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean, Kyle, either of you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what I've noticed from the elites,
because there's certain stuff that just
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't, what people think of elite like
Cam and Bubba, those highs for me are not
[SPEAKER_06]: what they are for other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're more just kind of whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Cam has always been more Sativa high,
what people would call that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate using that word, but I know that's
how people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can kind of identify what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they're more breeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're better breeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've found the Bubba hybrids have always
been really good for me, but I've never
[SPEAKER_06]: had good just plain Bubba to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it could have been the grow,
but I've tried different ones over the
[SPEAKER_06]: years and that's always just been the
same.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I always liked hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think to me, what elite is for clones
is always maybe they're better breeders.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not always good as smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I found.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously my keepers is I'm looking
for good smoke because it's all hits for
[SPEAKER_06]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had any experience growing any
elite clones or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I say it's also kind of subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously there's ones that have just been
around for a long time that everyone kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of unanimously agrees on, but then there's
other ones that have been around a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time that not too many people have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like screw was saying,
like he was chasing shoreline and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure that's a cut that's
like pretty difficult to get.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of fake shoreline out
there for so many years because the main
[SPEAKER_03]: guy who had it dipped offline for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long time to chase something and
then not be completely thrilled about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been one to even try and go and
buy any clones from anyone or any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not really interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone offered me one of the elites or
whatever, I may take it, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm like too interested in growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's very few that I am interested
in growing, but I'm more interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing people's selections that they've
found kind of like recent things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to end up getting someone's
old clone and end up having it just
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been my thing also with not wanting
to get clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a person that kind of likes to do
things on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to find something from C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, kind of then breathe that
into something that I then enjoy myself or
[SPEAKER_00]: just find something from C that I really
enjoy and just keep that and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that all makes sense, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess like that's kind of,
I know you wanted me to go two hours,
[SPEAKER_03]: but this is kind of like the end of it,
wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that said, any last thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean, any shout outs, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the few other punk rockers in the
group, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like stay strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw, you got any final words?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess thanks to everybody in the
syndicate just for, you know, making the
[SPEAKER_01]: place what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like syndicate is all of us,
you know, like that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's become quite a close friendship
for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not just like the Ken Illuminati
dudes, but everybody that's been a part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grown and grown and grown.

circle too, which is pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we get to find the people that
we really, really want to connect with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle, what you got?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, man, this was a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the doggy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, absolutely, man.
