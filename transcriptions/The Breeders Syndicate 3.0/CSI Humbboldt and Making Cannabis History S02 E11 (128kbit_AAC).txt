[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, bastards and bastardettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as you saw, I think we're going to
have TSI Humble come stop by.
[SPEAKER_02]: He may not show up at the very beginning,
but he'll be here at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will go over what he saw in the NL
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll keep our eyes peeled for when TSI
pops up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasabi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to teach you how to use a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean teach me how to use a
camera?
[SPEAKER_02]: As my own head's cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a thing called head space that you
need to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just analyzing my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just super anal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like logged in and like your shit was
like aiming at the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start off with a scenery of my my
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because nobody wants to see my
fucking face the first time they jump in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to traumatize anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to be smooth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of how to start this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know what you said,
because I just popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't said anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping managing technical
difficulties and whatnot that we might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get CSI on to chat about some
stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this this Friday evening, we kind of
decided that we were going to maybe sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of merge something that's current.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on right now is some historical
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had an excellent opportunity to do
that in the in the NL five project that
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and and CSI have been up to and NL
five probably needs no introduction in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that it's probably like one of the
most famous terms in all of Canada's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of legend behind it and
there's a lot of misinformation behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought for this episode,
maybe we could sort of like take you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: through like how it started, some of the
history to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this stuff has been chatted
about in various ways and shapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we thought it might be interesting to
sort of like coalesce it all into one
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start from back then and sort of bring
it into the now because modern times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, so I mean, I've done
I've helped with some like 90s stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes me feel old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the 90s is like 30 plus
years ago now and the 80s when all this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit was happening was 40 plus years ago
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people in cannabis have heard
about NL five, but it's mostly just
[SPEAKER_00]: legends and there's a lot of
misinformation and a lot of funny cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of odd stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of thought we'd just chat
about those kind of aspects a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of merge the history with a
little bit of the project that these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing because they tie in together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can start with maybe I'll
start maybe we can start with just the
[SPEAKER_00]: generalization, you know, and then we'll
start with some history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why everybody knows what NL
five is, in my opinion, is because of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville popularized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He picked a selection and he used the NL
five and a bunch of famous crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of which was probably the most famous
line of all time, the NL five haze.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other groups and Canadian seed
banks and all these different things
[SPEAKER_00]: started using the name NL five,
NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just sort of became part of the
fabric of cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of misunderstanding
understood about it or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's probably one of the most
recognizable terms in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even people like my parents,
my mom, my dad was who he was with weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but my mom had nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wanted nothing to do with it,
never learned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even she is sort of Northern Lights as
a street and Northern Lights and Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights five and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now what we've got going on is,
is I've joked on previous episodes or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that like when I was trying to
collect a lot of old stuff, it was almost
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're kind of in this wave of,
you know, famous things from the eighties
[SPEAKER_00]: and nineties, you know, or in any form
they might exist in has got a resurgence
[SPEAKER_00]: of popularity and interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people want to see what's up with,
you know, what was once common becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is really is kind of what it boils down
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for anyone that came into the weed
scene later, when NL five was already kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a myth, you know, you know,
hopefully we can like clear up a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff because there's a lot of there's a
lot of people that are talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we tell this tale, let's go ahead
and start with there was a man named
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbie there and Herbie went to a certain
hair hair salon where the North Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Light crew hung out and he would go to
they would go to this hair salon and
[SPEAKER_02]: commune and smoke weed and talk stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this guy named Herbie came in and he
was a veteran and he wanted to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and make a living for himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they set him up with some lights and
some some of the original Steve Murphy
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had some of his own different
hybrids he was working with, mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian and Mexican, I believe that was
the quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he he was the one who selected this NL
five clone from from his own work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Murphy Afghan and the Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, probably the the way
that people can understand it the best is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was a loose collective group of
friends, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: acquaintances, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Pacific Northwest area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbie was one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy named some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call him the Indian was
another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy was a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, you know, a there was a number
of different characters all involved at
[SPEAKER_00]: various points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a mostly everyone has to
remember that in that time, in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s, almost everything in America was
still sativa and blends of different
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all the all the weed that came
into America was seeded sativa weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the core of everybody starting to
breathe was you got three seeds with your
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rare shit was indica because
indica made hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash didn't come with three seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so indica seeds were really hard to
acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from people on the hippie
hashish trail, people like six damn skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: man and Neville and others made trips to
Afghanistan, which in that era was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely difficult to do and dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started bringing back small
amounts of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike sativa that was getting sativa
seeds spread out all over America in every
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo that was sold, indica seeds were hard
to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the NL story starts with a very small
handful of seeds of pure indica that came
[SPEAKER_00]: from this dude named Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, just like anybody,
the group in the Pacific Northwest up
[SPEAKER_00]: there started making hybrids of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crossed it to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crossed it to everything else they
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the the famous numbers of NL
basically, you know, connotate like the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower the number, the more indica and the
shorter it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one, two, three, four were
predominantly indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were based and smaller and you start
getting into five, six, seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, nine, 10, 11, and they start
getting more and more sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Matt's already interviewed one of the
main characters in the in this thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he basically stated that they took
that Steve Murphy Afghan and they crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: it to every sativa they could get their
hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hawaiians, Mexicans, Colombians,
Thai Indians, you said Indians blends of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things, hybrids of those things all
back and forth.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the NL five, they had this buddy named
Herbie who got involved and Herbie had a
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Hawaiian was, you know,
he crossed it got crossed to the Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Murphy Afghan and the it got called NL
five for its position in the height and
[SPEAKER_00]: the blend of sativa versus indica or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found a fino that they really,
really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NL five initially was a seed line
created within that little crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Herbie gave back to the NL crew
like this select fino that he was super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as best we can tell, it's a pure
Afghan from Steve Murphy on the one side
[SPEAKER_00]: and a Mexican Colombian, we believe,
on the other side that was called a
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian because it was grown in Hawaii,
but there is no indigenous Hawaiian weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Hawaiian weed was Mexican,
Colombian, a blend of those two or a blend
[SPEAKER_00]: of those two with Afghan.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then as you know,
as the story's been told, this gentleman
[SPEAKER_00]: sent Neville a whole bunch of seeds,
all numbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you have any of those
catalogs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy, but Neville's story is that
Neville's story is that he was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he did a lot of work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them, as we found out,
were a mess because they were a blend of
[SPEAKER_00]: indicas and sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this one seed of NL five out of a
bunch of indica sativa hybrids and a mess,
[SPEAKER_00]: he found this plant that was what he
called the pure indica throwback that
[SPEAKER_00]: showed zero sativa influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was covered in frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have a lot of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he started crossing this to things
and it crossed amazingly well with
[SPEAKER_00]: basically everything he threw on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the legend of NL five was born because
he crossed it to skunk one and he crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: it to NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it to haze and he crossed it to
NL two and he crossed it to a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started showing up in poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made like silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just sort of became one of the
building blocks of his genetic library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since he was one of the first dudes
that had a seed bank, anything that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: that he threw into a bunch of crosses kind
of went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these things are winning high
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stuff and it's getting big
glossy pictures and NL five haze was the
[SPEAKER_00]: most popular strain they sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the legend of it just took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a debate here because what
what's indisputable is that he went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: States and he got the Pacific Northwest
hash plant and the and the G 13 through
[SPEAKER_00]: friends of another guy who's pretty famous
named Jorge Cervantes, some friends of his
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked him up and he arranged for the
cutting that the guys in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest were growing as NL five to be
shipped over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did this clever thing where they
shipped this plant over in a terrarium of
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants and they took scissors and
they cut the serrations off the edges of
[SPEAKER_00]: each of the pot leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't look like wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sick, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sick idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just shaved all that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looked unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Neville is posted back when he used
to post on Mr. Nice that he didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: that one as much because it wasn't as
consistent of a breeder as the one he
[SPEAKER_00]: found amongst the seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right there you have this massive
confusion where everybody thinks NL five
[SPEAKER_00]: is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it is kind of the same thing,
but there's a seed line that never got
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a clone that they selected from
that seed line that was popular in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a clone that that Neville
found among seeds they sent to him and
[SPEAKER_00]: they all got called NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a lot of the confusion
lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think they'll be like,
oh, I've got the same clone that Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: used and all of his breeding, but it never
left the West coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, because Neville says he found it
in seed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there was there was two
select cuttings even early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, most people don't realize
this, but Neville says his was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: total Afghan throwback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that that the Seattle crew
describes had like two foot colas on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long running lime green colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember, if I remember, it was
stated that they combined different buds
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it look like it had a massive cola
for net full in the Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was there was some fun stuff going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some shenanigans, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shenanigans abound.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so yeah, I mean, there's an
aspect where I'm sorry, I'm looking down
[SPEAKER_00]: for a second because Matt didn't have his
catalog handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I always do, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a bigger version
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if everyone wants to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: That picture right there, that is a
picture of the mother cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taken in Amsterdam and put in the sensei
seeds catalog taken when it won a cup in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1995, it was printed in the 96 catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a that is one of the few existing
pictures of an actual growing NL five that
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it's short, it's squat,
it's leafy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's got all these things going
on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, so NL five, Neville said
that NL five was NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes was probably the most famous and
best selling thing in his whole catalog,
[SPEAKER_00]: both at his seed bank and later at Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NL five skunk one got renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was renamed Shiva,
Shiva Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it was renamed Shiva Skunk
at Sensei Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was sold the whole time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably it was sold from 87 or 88 all
the way through, you know, 1999 or the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still probably to this day, but it's not
the same shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And NL five Hayes was sold consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it just kind of entered into
the lexicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gotten old enough now that a
bunch of people are like, oh, I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the original cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you know, and and you know,
it it someone's saying nothing about the
[SPEAKER_00]: NL crew telling Neville that I mean,
Neville, you know, Neville spoke about the
[SPEAKER_00]: NL, but he basically like has said that he
just got he just got these labeled seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and he made his own inferences about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, he had he had to
make it up, basically, like he had to
[SPEAKER_00]: think, what what am I seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the guys back then,
it was in the 80s and they were all scared
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't really take copious notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was seen several times,
you know, and we actually know a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the NL five than we know about a lot
of the other NL numbers because of what
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbie was working with and what he said
he crossed to the Steve Murphy to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a lot of things, you know,
I mean, a lot of a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: greetings are collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small group of friends doing one
part at my garage and you do the next part
[SPEAKER_00]: of yours and this and that and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who's responsible for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be one or two people that gets
known for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, there's a whole little
group that's involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a kind of small group.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then, you know,
when it comes to NL five haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville claims that right before he left
Sensi about ninety five ish, they lost the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother of NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes kind of sense because if you
like, there's a bunch of NL five haze cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that still are kept in America,
especially in the New York region and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all are basically from 88 to 95.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not really people aren't
really like, oh, I got this one in 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of fire in those seven
or eight years that they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: marry those two plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, you know, super silver
haze and stuff like that was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's attempt to blend the three most
famous Amsterdam lines together,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was NL skunk and haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, now we have this whole
thing where everything gets different
[SPEAKER_00]: names and different nicknames.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tons of shit has NL or skunk or haze
blended into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might not know because it doesn't
have that name attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said, I assumed it was phenos of
one to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was different hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NL one was almost pure Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL two was another Afghan that they
actually got like a Kush type Afghan from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indian and they blended that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Steve Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three and four are sort of lost to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has them, but they were also,
you know, they started increasing amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of sativa and five through 11 were just
the NL crews crossing that Afghan to
[SPEAKER_00]: different sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the more the higher the
number, the taller the plant, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look around, at some of
Neville's early catalogs, you can see him
[SPEAKER_00]: playing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses the eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses the five.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses the nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the one and the two, you know,
all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after three or four years,
he decided basically that he was only
[SPEAKER_00]: going to breed with the one, the two,
and the one cutting of the five that he
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these other hybrids kind of go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because probably because they were mixes
of extreme sativas within the hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were probably a lot more of a
pain in the ass for a breeder to tame.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did have high, as far as his
keepers, he did use a rigorous selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he didn't keep, he went through a lot
of seeds to find what he kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Indian, I believe the Indian was
Native American, but I can't say that for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain, but he was, he was Native
American, but he was, he was part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these guys aren't,
aren't well known and don't want to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the well known because in the 80s,
especially in the late 80s, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of rolling busts and they all got
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a hard time to be a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a green merchant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, there was a lot of persecution
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of secrecy back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why they didn't keep
copious notes because they didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: them to be used against them in a court of
law later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but basically I say,
I think it's fair to say that the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why everybody knows NL five is because of
never that I think that's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody agrees with that too,
because he, and even like the Seattle guys
[SPEAKER_00]: will say that if they hadn't sent it to
Neville, it likely would have been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they went through a rolling series
of busts and had issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, so it was sold at Neville
seed bank for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was sold at Sensi for a number
of years after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never pure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a hybrid, scum one, Hayes,
NL two, silver Pearl, other poly hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: blended together, but never really by
itself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a pure seed line of NL five,
but nobody got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't make it to out of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was given to like a couple people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like, even great, you know,
even like some of the Seattle guys said
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was a couple of cuts that got
out the eight, the nine, and maybe one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, and maybe one of the twos from the
Indian, but nothing else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the five survived because it went to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason it survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason why it survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you listen to the Seattle crew,
they had one version of NL five that they
[SPEAKER_00]: kept as a cutting and kind of cropped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Neville found a reader that he kept,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it kind of, it kind of went
into, it kind of went into legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and so, you know,
uh, and so, yeah, I see all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with this person's NL one,
what's up with this NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened is, is because it became so
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two things happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that in Amsterdam, anytime anything
gets famous, people get seeds of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they white label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they offer up their own versions of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, when the Canadian
seed companies got involved, they ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a bunch of stuff from Amsterdam,
blending it to Canadian strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming that they had these things for
sales purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you get, and they all have
sort of dodgy history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to provenance, what I've,
what I've told you so far is pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: factually agreed to by the people that
sent it to Neville and Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people around Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then it gets famous and
there's a proliferation of people and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: banks that claim to have various stuff,
but they weren't passing out this cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they weren't sharing it just so other
people in different continents could like
[SPEAKER_00]: make their own seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like today where people were
trading seeds back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and clones back and forth,
especially to competitors, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dutch are extremely business oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to just like bro out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's why Matt's laughing
because they very are very much business
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have a cut and everyone else wants
it and they're breeding off it and making
[SPEAKER_00]: money, there's not really a chance they're
going to share that fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a definite chance everybody's
going to say that they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a definite chance that
everyone's going to say they have it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to use that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any name that becomes famous in cannabis
gets used.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so someone asked about,
you know, and so, um, that's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of where NL five, you know,
just got crossed to some very famous
[SPEAKER_00]: things and Neville made some very fucking
famous lines off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't that much weed strains
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the combination of that and high times
being like the premier magazine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get all these high quality glossy
photos and all the, the cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was only one cannabis cup a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this shit got hella famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legendary, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, what about,
what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about NL one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Denali's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and that one is probably the
closest thing to Steve Murphy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's, it's got a little bit of
discrepancy between the guys involved as
[SPEAKER_00]: to what exactly is in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it's, that's kind of
irrelevant because what actually got sold
[SPEAKER_00]: is what got sent to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody should know that Neville got
it in, in, uh, in 84, 85 and spent two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three years seeing what he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you bought Northern lights in 85 or
86 or even 87 from his catalog,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a fucking hodgepodge of any of the
lines all blended together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until about 88 that,
uh, um, it wasn't about, I'm going to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: off my light because people are bitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't about, you know, 88 that,
uh, he started coming out with NL one,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL two and NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, and so, and then,
so then these numbers get attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 1989, late 88 is when NL five
Hayes got released.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And NL five skunk one and NL five this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so NL one, NL two, you know,
when it went to Sensei, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just called NL one Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called NL two Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so lots of people got NL because
it was one of the most common things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to screenshot some of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to like pat your head and
rub your stomach at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I try to chat about something and
sound like, you know, fairly have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: have some flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I read a question and I think
about it and all of a sudden I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: talking and I'm just staring at the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for all that, you know, if I miss your
question, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I've chatted about this a
bunch before on some of the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and a little bit more detail,
but that's what got it famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now anytime anything becomes
famous, you know, it's kind of like music
[SPEAKER_00]: or fashion or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets fucking recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it gets old enough and most people
don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden people are like,
I've got this ancient NL five cut and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: making beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this, this, this, you know,
um, you know, and maybe, maybe Matt,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could explain the Booth cut or the new
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I've never talked to Bodhi about that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep meaning to ask him because
people ask it a lot, but I don't know the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the history on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, people, you know, and,
you know, people asked about Bob Hemphill
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, uh, and, and the,
and Ella and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people have been people,
you know, it's really hard when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, when you get seeds and lines that
are, that are 25, 30 years old plus,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, provenance on it becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, apparently, you know,
uh, Hemphill used to work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the coastal seeds collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and apparently, you know, he got it
through some friend of cog use,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but NL one was sold for, you know,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, and there was never a specific
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Neville had some breeding males
that he used, uh, NL one and NL two and
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's thing was almost always males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were part of his breeding males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it wasn't like NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while never Neville just had one
cutting that had to be kept alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And L one was kind of like a line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any like Durbin poison or
something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime there's a line, it's a lot
harder to lose the line than it is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dependent on one specific cut to
stay alive and keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing you should know is
because these, these, these fucking Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: guys are such businessmen when you're not
sharing a cut, amongst your homies and
[SPEAKER_00]: your good friends, it exponentially
increases the chance that some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease or accident or drought or worker
error is going to kill your fucking cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That greed will get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you haven't shared it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets lost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, you know, and so, uh, Ben and Alan
drunkers aren't generous people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't sharing, they weren't sharing
shit with anybody, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it, it, uh, and L five is super
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And L is super famous that we went through
probably a 10 year period where nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: gave a shit, uh, probably starting right
around the Kush sour going into cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where old things were just old and
unpopular, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like Northern lights, skunk one,
these were a cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that, that like people are kind of
looking at now, like, oh, they got the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the big, like if I saw that in a,
in a store with tons of coal clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the early mid 2000s,
it's like, huh, give me some of that new
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was so abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we had it, I can't remember
who said it, but it's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 15, 20 years ago, you,
you bought seeds from Nirvana gypsy
[SPEAKER_00]: Nirvana and you got free skunk one seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he might as well, because you had
so many of them and it was so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, you had to give them
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause nobody wanted to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a thing where everything's
so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would anyone want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people's tastes and change,
you know, people's, you know, taste
[SPEAKER_00]: changes and then it becomes rare and then
people want it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people in cannabis don't hold
onto anything unless it's currently
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what once becomes we've,
we've seen it over and over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, where something that was
once abundant becomes Uber rare or lost a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll say it straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it, you know, hopefully he pops on here
this evening, but if it wasn't for CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: loving the Urkel and breeding with it a
ton, most people wouldn't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His prolific breeding is probably the
reason why that genetics survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying he's the only person
that held it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but he, but yeah, I used to know,
I mean, we're not going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: purples very long here tonight,
but like I used to know dozens upon dozens
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers 15 years ago that ran Urkel and
you, and then diesel and Kush gets popular
[SPEAKER_00]: and like six people held onto it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, and the reason why I brought
that up is because that's how super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: became almost extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how nobody can find the dead,
the dead skunk turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how all these things become rare or
hoarded or extinct is they're so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody thinks they need to care to
preserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hippies and growers start looking
around at who's got that old school and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't fucking find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times the name game happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get a different name or,
you know, someone makes seeds with it and
[SPEAKER_02]: he has a different name that it carries on
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people don't even know to look in that
direction for said one of these baselines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that before too,
where I love the counterculture aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans giving weed nicknames.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for lineage, it's a real pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's terrible because we take whatever
the name of the actual thing is and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets a nickname and then it goes to a
different crew and they give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: different fucking nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes to this other crew and
they give it a spin on that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 20 years goes by and you're
trying to trace what the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing telephone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to go through four or five
nicknames back and then you get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: core thing and then you and then the trail
goes dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, so now after 10 or
15 years of nobody giving a shit about
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to try these ancient things
that they grew up when they were kids
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: About are these the first week,
the first like true famous week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they want to see what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see what's up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so now because there's
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all of a sudden, where there's
interest, there's economy and people start
[SPEAKER_00]: popping up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people probably don't know that
there was two completely distinct cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that were used, one from America and one
from home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a seed line, but it was
given out to nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see stuff where I've got NL
five pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, you can you can talk,
you can you can know that that Neville had
[SPEAKER_00]: it pure because the guy that made it says
I sent it to him pure along with the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will says I got it pure from
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, they both agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's when I sent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did you share it with anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody has a bunch of hybrids or
Canadians got it and sold their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people get it and it's got a name
attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and because we're cannabis and
because all of our stories are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: black market or underground or
prohibition, it gets really difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it comes down to who you choose
to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of the time with a lot of
these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some people will get like NL and
they'll and the guy will be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this for 30 years and never left
the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the proof I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's labels all over the place and
people are buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it that?
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing one thing I also noticed was
that during the Filos era, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: would get said clone that they got with
dubious heritage or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They submit it to Filos and by doing so
say that Filos verified their clone is
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: That started happening a lot, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a real problem because and as
we learned allegedly shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Filos couldn't tell people any kind of
plant relation with any consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing that maybe we should say
this about CSI is that it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is, but CSI sent and this is how
Matt, myself and CSI discovered that Filos
[SPEAKER_00]: was really, really, really full of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some evidence before, but this was
kind of one of the big kickers was that
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI had made a cross and he sent in both
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he wants to story out so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shut up about it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even mention what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered that their genetic
sequencing wasn't as strong as we would
[SPEAKER_00]: have hoped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was definitely disappointing
with the consistency of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so people thought that their
genetic testing was like American genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can have 23 and me or some shit
and be like, oh, my God, I'm five percent
[SPEAKER_00]: Norwegian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, grandpa was from Germany
and this guy and I'm like, and I'm part
[SPEAKER_00]: African or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were hoping that same kind of
accuracy would be transferred into weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to move Caleb in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb, click the thing and say request to
join if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you if you see how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit the request to join button so I can
add you in when you got time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it and, you know, in order the
other the other thing about it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is for like talking about human genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is geneticists can go to like a pure
Norwegian or a pure Japanese or a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese or whatever, and they can start
comparing DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing these different things and they
know how to sequence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be amazing if DNA evidence had
existed in Holland in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neville and SSC and Sensei and these
early groups would have been able to like
[SPEAKER_00]: put down markers of what was what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could have seen their
descendants because you'd have something
[SPEAKER_00]: to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so it remains a dream
because here he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sir, your lighting is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just you look like you look
like you're on 60 minutes and you're one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those like grayed out, you know,
like guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with this protection program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bright in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bright in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can hear your voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: My face too bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't trying to, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'll do like an introduction and
not the ones needed and then I'll shut up
[SPEAKER_00]: and get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the reason why we did we we
decided to do this selection tonight was
[SPEAKER_00]: because it blends something that's
currently going on with something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely famous and has a bunch of
history to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just spent a whole bunch of time
chatting about the history of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the simple and maybe like,
you know, mellow way to talk about it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that in our search of history,
we started getting in contact with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these original Northern Lights crew people
and hearing their story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of that, we got we got some
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt got some seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Matt and and Caleb here decided
to collaborate on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Caleb donated some space and some
time and some energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did a bunch of stuff,
both growing out, you know, looking within
[SPEAKER_00]: the line, making hybrids and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was I was involved as much as
listening to them talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And turn it over to them because they are
about to offer up some seeds of what they
[SPEAKER_00]: have going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be, you know, some of the
first real NL to come on the market in a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt and Caleb, why don't you chat
about what you found and what you saw and
[SPEAKER_00]: what interested you and da da da da?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first things first, you know,
you know, when I posted up on IG,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's there's a few people who
are like, you know, what did what did Matt
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that have to do with any of
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't even be growing these seeds
if Matt had, you know, had all that
[SPEAKER_01]: dialogue with, you know, mystery man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he's the one who,
you know, put all that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one who sourced these seeds,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't be growing nothing without
Matt, you know, making that first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, maybe maybe I'll throw in
one more thing so everyone knows when you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, breeders like us get together,
it's super common for some breeding to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a collaborative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they both have an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other person has some room that
they're willing to put towards the idea or
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse or some indoor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come up with a plan and you breed
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people might not hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: J.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: of the transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but but everybody everybody,
you know, lots, lots of friends who are
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders kind of collaborate on little
things like that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super common just so people just so
people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you know, Matt had the
seeds, you know, CSI had the space and
[SPEAKER_00]: skill and skill and, you know,
and ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had the interest in the history
behind it and really wanted to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it, you know, the project happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some people know,
some people don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first, you know, clone I ever
grew came from my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was Northern Lights back in 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's about that one,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I remember, I mean,
I rocked it on and off until about 2002
[SPEAKER_01]: when I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a coal plant, super frosty,
decent density, you know, not not like
[SPEAKER_01]: rock hard Girl Scout cookies or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I describe the nose, but I'm absolutely
horrible at describing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people ask, I'm like, it smells
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my forte.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm more of a visual, you know,
oh, it looks like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's similar to this in the looks
department, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, other than, you know,
it smells great or whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the dude for for the sniffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when you lost it, was it something
you kept looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you were picking up clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was one of the things that,
you know, family and friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I lost it and I went
looking and nobody had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people are asking if it purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, not the one I got from my
dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't really recall it even
remotely having any type of purple to it
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these these, you know, NL five seeds
that, you know, I just ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is very, very little, if any,
you know, actual purple to any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, sometimes when you're
making seed, you know, the purple traits
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of kind of tend to take a back seat.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of purple things would be halfway
green, you know, or all the way green,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when they're making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, Mendo purple does that,
you know, where it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more green than purple, even under cool
temperatures and everything when it's full
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the plants have different
processes when they're pregnant versus
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they they they do they do very
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their their goal is different at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I didn't even think about this,
but I'm I'm feeding seeded out plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, nitrogen all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to cut off their nitro
source, you know, early like it would a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the goal is is healthy,
mature seeds, not attractive flower.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower is just the carrier for the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very different feeding regimen to
get where you want to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why when you have a failed run
and a bunch of flour and no seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that smoke ain't the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe I should mention something is
that, you know, CSI has actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he has some pictures of some of
these old old gardens and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, since it was all
prohibitiony back then, they were on
[SPEAKER_00]: Polaroids and you learn with Polaroids
that they fade over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they become the the colors
start to become washed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edges start to become less distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he cataloged some of it and,
you know, you can you can get a general
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, but it's not the sharpest of picks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have thousands of these Polaroids,
you know, for, you know, the better part
[SPEAKER_01]: of a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're not much to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a bummer, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something you didn't know at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knew that over 15, 20, 25 years
Polaroids would would fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regular picture developed at a,
you know, you know, old school style will
[SPEAKER_00]: stay good for a long time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polaroids don't, you know, I should have
banned them all while I had the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we all should have done
things differently when we were younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the common theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your camera's slowly but surely burning
out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, so the best thing is,
is I was having I was having a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with with our buddy Pip,
who is going to drop some seeds soon and
[SPEAKER_00]: he might come on here and chat with Matt
and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he didn't really want to show his
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely going to show him this
CSI tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's exactly what he's looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This embodied voice coming out of coming
out of the darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that how they always used to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very 60 minutes in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just need now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need the voice tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need that voice tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us what you saw, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us what you saw in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the the seeds that Riot and I have
available are basically an open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination from 47 plants, 27 females,
20 males just open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there was there was
definitely good, bad and the ugly in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one plant that was near
identical to the normal I grew,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from 94 on from my dad smelled
like it looked extremely similar to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I had one of my good old
old buddies from, you know, from that
[SPEAKER_01]: area, you know, you know, check checking
things out with me as it was progressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, yeah, that's that's just
like the plant we we used to rock,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of variety in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorites, of course,
was this one that was super frosty,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a popcorn nugget thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of bubblegummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I, you know, describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know, maybe other people
would, you know, just describe the smell
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're definitely saving that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there one that was I just have
written down a stinky fuck, but it's it
[SPEAKER_01]: had like 10 different smells, you know,
top, middle, bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't describe that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's there's guys with
noses who are like, oh, yeah, that's blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
you know, and list 20 different smells on
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all I know is it smelled amazing,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one, that one's definitely a key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were some other ones that,
you know, ranged, you know, this way and
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my my end up being keepers
might not definitely going to give them a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of few runs to decide on which ones
are going to kind of make the cut for
[SPEAKER_01]: future projects, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm stoked about is that we
get to see them as clones, not just seed
[SPEAKER_02]: seed moms, you know, but as clones and
clones of every single it's it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Expansive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a it was a cool it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know, you know, he he he credits me
with getting the seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was it was really cool to be able
to to look inside CSI's mindset as he did
[SPEAKER_02]: these selections, what he was looking for,
how he went about it, how many clones he
[SPEAKER_02]: was keeping of each.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot from dude during this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he put in the work no matter what he
says.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put in the fucking work on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe I should add something in
where Caleb and I chat a bunch about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, phenos he's found in seed lines
before that didn't survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the backup clone didn't
survive and he lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, you know,
I got X amount of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, you know, how excited were you,
dude, to find something that was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the spitting image of your lost
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I was honestly more excited
with some of these other ones that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because, you know, back in 94,
you're the reality is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a traded clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea, you know, where it came
from, how many seeds it got selected from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, anything about it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing with traded clones
is, you know, it might be selected from
[SPEAKER_01]: one or four, 10 or a hundred, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like, you know, having the
opportunity to actually select from better
[SPEAKER_01]: than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think too that like, there are things
for all of us now that we're all older,
[SPEAKER_00]: where some of the strains that you grow
first and you build your first
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with as a grower,
stick in your mind because you're learning
[SPEAKER_00]: so much then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is your kind bud plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they really stick with you,
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you think back like,
oh, what could I have done with that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: when I actually had some knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had that plant, I was an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was 19 or something and I
didn't know Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm like, you know, what could I
do if I had it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm a little interested too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is an NL talk,
but are you, do you want to talk about any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the pinks and purfs stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing too, since that's a big
project you have going on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can touch on it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, had me amped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm definitely going to,
you know, try to post up a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: on that soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because there's some interesting
stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that one keeper I was telling
you about, it smells better than 99% of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed I've come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not a purple pheno,
pure green, you know, no purple traits to
[SPEAKER_01]: it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, the smell is just so
overpowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could be a pass around a keeper
as long as it's over 5% THC, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should mention that some of the
terpiest things tend to be lower THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ratio there that's not fully
understood, but a lot of times things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are extremely human perception terpy don't
tend to be the most potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things out there that have both,
but a lot of them don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I told you much or anything about
this pinks and purfs plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it through your convert,
you and Matt chatted about it and he
[SPEAKER_00]: called me all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's rare that you sound that
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that you found.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was, I've never heard him overstate
anything about anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude pops thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he tells me, dude, like this is
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, I think homie told me
something like he thinks it might be like
[SPEAKER_00]: the best pheno he's found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which for some, for someone like you to
say who popped literally like thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds over a number of years and searches
through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give, to give credit to,
you know, what, what plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of produce these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, uh, this particular plant,
you know, it has Mendo purple in its
[SPEAKER_01]: background, but there's no purple traits
to this plant at all, but Mendo purple has
[SPEAKER_01]: this strong, uh, mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, trait that pops up in the ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing is that mango times a
hundred, you know, it's, it's just the
[SPEAKER_01]: strongest mango I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as you know, and a bunch more
fruit too, but, uh, you know, I know it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets that mango, you know, at least,
you know, a portion of it from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, could be cool as long as I
don't lose the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one, one of the things that the
Mendo piece certainly has is it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty wide genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of Terps in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so then you throw it on
something else that's also Terpy and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: wide and you can get these unusual things
that have a potential to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of like, people should
know this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I should say it right now where
it's like, if you cross something to like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, you know, to, to, I don't know,
to deep chunk, you're going to get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of deep chunk and it's going to be really
consistent, you know, and there's certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things you throw certain things on cookies
and it looks very cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people get frustrated when you
cross two very wide things because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get a bunch of junk and you can get a
bunch of this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all like unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then every once in a while,
amongst all that stuff, there's this gem
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so wide and unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the frustration and the effort
pays off because a really wide base of
[SPEAKER_00]: things to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I should say this too,
is when, you know, when Caleb was
[SPEAKER_00]: referencing, when he did the open
pollination, that there was some gems,
[SPEAKER_00]: some mids, some junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 90s weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a wide genetic base,
you're going to get amazing midsy junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also on that pinks and purples one,
you know, I was, I was, I always forget
[SPEAKER_01]: this, but I grew up when, when I made
those and found that one, I was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: out 180 of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was only one like it out of 180.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I wonder how it's going to
breed because it was such a outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there other, other phenos that were
more consistent and like pop it up more
[SPEAKER_02]: often?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the, the purple ones were
predominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To find an actual green one in,
in this hybrid was actually the rarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most, most everything was,
you know, some form of light pink or
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender, you know, all the way through,
you know, purple to almost black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but yeah, the, the green ones
were, were rare, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I, I probably kept out of the 180,
I probably kept about 20 or so of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the darker purple ones and just the
real terpier ones, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're all, I don't think I,
I have any other green ones out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole, all, all the purples and the
blacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wild, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it was so consistently that,
and then this one pops up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and so maybe I should throw this out
there just real quick before we totally
[SPEAKER_00]: lose the thread on it is on some of these
ones that you found that, that the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's super frosty and smells to you like
bubble gum and the one that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: reminds you strongly of your dad,
dad's dad's NL and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably planning on doing some
more breeding with those select females,
[SPEAKER_00]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already working on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first round of course was the open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have a room that's a couple of
few weeks into flower and that's all the
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my keeper male, my favorite male out
of the whole bunch, which is, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's, it's like almost a
milk chocolatey smelling male and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: super pungent and he almost looks like a
bigger, uh, version of purple Indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's, that's a throwback from
the same, you know, Washington areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds came from, you know,
so, you know, there's, there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: to that in a, like, I've told,
uh, um, told Matt, I'm not sure if I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you not so, but, uh, um,
when the norm lights I used to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, occasionally I throw a late
Nana or whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew out a bunch of S one seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I gave, you know, some of these S
ones to my buddy, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: clones of the S ones anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, he, uh, accidentally crossed
it to train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that stuff was grown out,
it had that same chocolateiness that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling in this thing, you know,
when grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it's just coincidence
or, or what, but you know, it could just
[SPEAKER_01]: be same, same, similar genetics,
the power of accidents, the power of
[SPEAKER_00]: accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I should throw this in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, with, with the, the seeds that,
uh, Matt and Caleb are offering up this
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollination, uh, what that's going to
give you is, you know, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you your own ability to hunt through
the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be very wide,
you know, but you could find gems just
[SPEAKER_00]: like he found, you know, uh, you could,
you could absolutely perhaps find what you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't know that look, you know,
there, there could be bubblegum smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be this ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be, there's a reasonably good
chance that somewhere in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: those phenols pop up again and then give
them X amount of months to do some more
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get the chance to see if some of
these selected females breed true for the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that he liked, because those will
be on offer too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like for people that
don't know, that's kind of like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get old seeds or seeds that you want to
preserve, one of the best things to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the genetic diversity of the line is
just to open pollinate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you can set aside,
you know, some seeds from selected phenols
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can keep certain phenols and start
breeding with them and intentionally and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing where it takes you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like the, that's one of
the processes of, um, taking old seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to both preserve the line,
but then take it in certain directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of how I, and you've
done that a number of times with like
[SPEAKER_00]: various heirloom strains that you've come
across, you know, always open pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you can do whatever
you want past that, you know, directional
[SPEAKER_01]: this way, that way, or the other,
you know, and everybody else can do as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as, you know, you share the seed and
all that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other projects you're,
you're super stoked about past that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like any FEM projects coming up that
you're, you're, you're pumped about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I got that patient zero common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patient zero is on its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know that, that one's going to
be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not sure how that one's going to
turn out, but you know, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could explain for people,
cause you have so many names, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause you're so prolific about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is patient zero?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, patient zero is, uh, you know,
uh, um, basically it's the, just the Urkel
[SPEAKER_01]: across the Pakistani Chitral Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew out, uh, a hundred and
something of those years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my absolute favorite plant,
uh, uh, of that one was, uh, was,
[SPEAKER_01]: was the one I named patient zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, it's, it's kinda,
as long as you like a little turpentine on
[SPEAKER_01]: your diet, it's pretty all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe I'll add that to it too,
where it's like a lot of modern breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: today is one offs where people hybridize
something and then just toss it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what he just described is what's known
as like multi-stage breeding, where he
[SPEAKER_00]: made a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew out a bunch of phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He picked one that he liked and now he's
doing further work with that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, probably crossing it to itself and
crossing it to other, uh, cuttings that he
[SPEAKER_00]: has in the stable that he thinks might
blend well with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of my favorites, I actually have a
flowering right now, um, is, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the Mendo purple number 54 selection
from, you know, grown out that last
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred and something of those,
the Urkel one Oh three, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: S one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, those, you know,
um, I reversed the one Oh three slapped it
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Mendo man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as uniform as you can get really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, uh, the Mendo is extremely
dominant on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, they're all, they look more like
Mendo purple plants than you can barely
[SPEAKER_00]: see any Urkel to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, both of those selections were
made out of that room that I came and
[SPEAKER_00]: visited you and saw before you,
uh, the S ones of Urkel and the S ones of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo P. Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, definitely interesting though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was excited too, like about,
I don't know if you want to talk about any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the purple punch stuff or if that's,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the findings in that you're kind
of saying that are unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, we've talked and the most
surprising thing about breeding with
[SPEAKER_01]: purple punch is how fucking stable it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you're working with,
you know, it doesn't matter what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, OGs, decals, chem dogs,
scouts, you know, and then all the popular
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff based off all those, you're gonna
find a nice portion of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, hermaphrodism, you know, more so if,
you know, your, your environment's not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, perfect, but you know,
even if you have a perfect environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's always going to be a percentage of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the purple punches have almost the
lowest, uh, levels of hermaphrodism I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in any hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's, that's useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something people look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like the fact that it popped
up in an OG GDP was kind of shocking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I, I was, I was the,
I wasn't a huge fan of purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even, you know, start growing it
until a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of ignored it and was like,
I got plenty of my own Oracle hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it has traits that it put
puts forward and you really can't argue
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the same way, you know, we both just
kind of dodged hype for a while with like
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking, the, the, the gorilla glue
and that, and then ended up at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: that shit's kind of good there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting, that's an
interesting aspect that people maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: should hear about is sometimes you can
have an amazing cut that checks a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes and it breeds like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It throws a bunch of junk and it does the
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inherent in the cut itself doesn't seem to
translate to its children very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other times you can take
something like purple punch that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just talking about that has a lot of nice
traits, but kind of lacks high or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't think that much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you cross it to things and it's
children come out incredibly amazing with
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of traits that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes a breeding parent can
actually be kind of a crappy crappy plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, Caleb likes a lot of the S ones
of my Mendo P quite a bit more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: mama.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the mama is amazing for
breeding, but as an actual plant itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some aspects to it that are
unpredictable and it's low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but some of its children and some of
the things that it throws and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: breed, um, and sometimes you might take
something like purple punch that people
[SPEAKER_00]: make fun of and you breed with it and
you're like, wow, this thing is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It throws all these traits consistently
that are useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like you could talk for a minute
about how stable that bubble gum cut you
[SPEAKER_00]: have is and why you use it in so many
different things because it throws like
[SPEAKER_00]: rock, you know, it's, it, it doesn't rot
very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got incredible structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it densens things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not the densest cut out there,
but it's, it's, uh, it's definitely,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, you know, as, as rot resistant as
you can, you can get a plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, on, on my worst year, year ever
outdoors, I think I was aiming for like
[SPEAKER_01]: 700 pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had six inches of rain the
last week of September, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: first week of October, and I lost 50 to 60
pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% of that garden to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that came through that
garden was probably less than 1% rot ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: was that bubble gum cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, you know, tons of people are
like, you know, what's your best,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mold resistant, you know,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right there, you know, so that
outdoor queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone, sometimes those traits,
like they were just talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, uh, Caleb does an enormous
amount of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for him to say that the purple punch is
some of the most non intersects stable
[SPEAKER_00]: thing he's ever worked with is saying
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when he says that like this
plant is almost immune to mold and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the most mold resistant plant I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it passes that trait to some progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's useful information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people commenting on the
purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the outstripped strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like when breeding has changed from
where it was maybe 10 years ago on what we
[SPEAKER_02]: would select for potency wise,
what we wouldn't use, what we would use
[SPEAKER_02]: certain one of us, you know, um,
purple punch all I'd ever heard about was
[SPEAKER_02]: how weak it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just never, I never got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it is a, is a very extract
centric community now and with extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much everything's fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of things are more turp-based
now, where people are checking out what
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of turps are being passed,
how they breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, some people won't wanna
fuck with anything that doesn't lay them
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I like all kinds of ranges of
different highs, and I don't like being
[SPEAKER_02]: laid out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, Purple Punch is fucking
perfect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, weed affects humans in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite strains to smoke on a
regular basis, the other two guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're checking, you know, they don't like
it that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They agree it's a super quality cut,
but it's not something with their body
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry that really adapts all that
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends that only like incredibly
potent indicas because they wanna be
[SPEAKER_00]: hammered down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a sativa makes them crawl up the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other friends that smoke a sativa
and they relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, cannabis and individual strains
don't think that the way it affects you is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it affects everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a range there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like keeping so many
different cultivars, because I like a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole spectrum of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know other people, too, like
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't always breed for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the Purple Punch reverse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reverses fine.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it reverses easily, but won't ever
throw intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of odd in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The S1 that got grown now, I don't think I
found a single ball or nanner on any of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is almost unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're usually going to get at least 10 to
20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say 10 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could just be one ball down low
or one late nanner or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always going to be like 10 to
20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's certain things that perm,
but won't reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've talked before about we're
not gonna get into it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the old sour cuts are famous for not
reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or getting a handful of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also famous for the wrong
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they throw nanners that can create
seed in your room for flower production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to grow it boofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some sour D's in a fully seeded out
room just recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And completely full of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about week four, it just starts
balling up, just hanging all kinds of sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel balls, even though it's fully
seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole room was completely seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't have any risk of pollinating
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still felt the need to throw out
just a ton of balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you doing with those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see any pollen off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what I consider to be the
original, but the one I got, the Chem D
[SPEAKER_00]: cut, is pretty famous for throwing a bunch
of nanners at week three, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't really, they don't
really, you know, they don't they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really make seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that Chem D or just Chem D's in
general, it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they throw bananas like they're
going out of style.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trait that goes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had any number of friends or
helpers or whatever on a light depth
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse come to me panicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because half the greenhouse has bananas
popping out all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, calm down, calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's the D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can find a bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you do that with cherry pie
or something and you have beans
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain things, certain things are
different, different risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's different levels of
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, maybe we should, maybe we
should chat about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should reel it back in for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason why we did this NL five
chat, both starting in the 80s and going
[SPEAKER_00]: through some of the history and then
bringing Caleb on was to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: project that that him and Matt have going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just dropped the seeds,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we're about to or just did another
dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caleb's Caleb's site is Humboldt CSI dot
com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could buy them on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: See code dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a it's a it's a riot and and
Caleb collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a big open pollination of
genetics from one of the people that was
[SPEAKER_00]: intimately involved in the old NL crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the provenance is excellent as far as
like who it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but then on top of that,
too, the proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it the it's a chance for
people to maybe hunt around if you have if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a little adventurous and look
through something old and something
[SPEAKER_00]: famous, you know, and, you know,
Caleb found a few things in it that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: super excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully you guys will,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways that we're going to
make sure that not everything is skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: O.G., cookie, Cushman's, whatever is by
people taking effort and reviving some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these old things and making fresh bats of
batches of seed that are more viable and
[SPEAKER_00]: then getting them into people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gene pool stays wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it a cool old project to
something that's extremely famous and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's potential in it, but you can
better believe that most modern breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a few exceptions, is the same 30 or
40 cuts blended in a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways over the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this harkens back to a much older
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a possibility there that when
you outcross things to something that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't like each other, if you take these
NL fives and you start throwing it on
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff you have, you might get
some unusual stuff you're not expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Britain's fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like because that's because
that's the thing is a lot of breeders say
[SPEAKER_00]: that, like, sometimes, you know,
crossing two very distinct things together
[SPEAKER_00]: is where you really get quality to pop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you're certainly introducing
something older in the gene pool that was
[SPEAKER_00]: very common 20, 30 years ago, but now is
many generations interbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by these guys doing this project,
it's kind of getting thrown out there
[SPEAKER_00]: again, where it can get bred into a lot of
modern stuff and people get to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you'll get more
opportunities to see what seed CSI is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing with the work in future breeding
projects that seem like they're already
[SPEAKER_00]: engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully people are going to buy a
bunch of this stuff and start posting and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying them out themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the ways you can keep
cannabis history alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making the first with the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, mixing it with modern things and
seeing what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you guys think would be the
best
[SPEAKER_01]: available plant line, whatever,
out there to cross to the NL fives?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally I want to see the hogs breath
in all five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be cool if we could
track that down and do that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been out of my hands for a while,
but I think that would be interesting just
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so, you know, I actually think that it
might cross well with something like the
[SPEAKER_00]: dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kind of a potentially almost a
backcross, potentially almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a backcross has to use the
technically the same cut to go back to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe something that is very NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one thing I'll say about that dog
shit grown indoor is, boy, does it look
[SPEAKER_00]: like 90s weed, like lime green with bright
orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just has that like NL type of like
like look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say hydro, but Caleb is
purely organic, so I don't want to insult
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that like that like big sack of
hydro NL that you would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just super frosty and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but it might give it
some stretch and some vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might kind of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I get interested
about is crossing two different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think have similar parentage
behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see if you get some
throwbacks because both parents have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do have the dog shit in my latest
round.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, but it's getting across to
that that chocolatey NL five male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I think there are better
there are males that kind of look more
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, you know, I didn't use them
personally for this round because I liked
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, particular, you know,
chocolatey one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I was going to throw out one more
recommendation and combine the old with
[SPEAKER_00]: the new one of Neville's most classic
combinations was NL five and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of view the diesel family as
what we have is surviving modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that there's not cheese and a couple
of other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of view like sours as American
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or very, very skunkish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be kind of cool to see like
what we have now is skunk and what we have
[SPEAKER_00]: now is NL blended back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was one of the most classic
best selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they combine super well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have cheese in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at least one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking skunk one or skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's cheese is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously pure skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just thinking of certain diesels
just because I consider I consider certain
[SPEAKER_00]: diesels modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me, that even though it doesn't
have the name, I consider a diesel to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like a skunk, skunk, skunkoid type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's got that kind of skunk
type growth to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got these very I basically think of
like gas and diesel as it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: roadkill, but it is on that skunk
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like different angles of the same
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of how I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing, too,
is that you know, you know, you cross it
[SPEAKER_00]: to things you hope are going to cross
well, and then you cross it to some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just random.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes those random ones end up
being the best ones because you really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really don't know what genes are
going to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really don't know what recessives
are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so to take it back to humans,
unless both parents have the gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't have kids with blue eyes or
green eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you if if one parent has the
recessive, the other parent has the
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant, it won't combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blonde hair is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both parents have to have the blonde hair
gene or the red hair gene or it won't pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes if you take two things
that you think might have similar genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get some recessives that pop and
all of a sudden something unusual comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I promise to not hold Caleb too
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he's got some shit to do tonight,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thankful for you coming and talking
about the Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everybody's super stoked to be able
to hear about it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, is there anything else you want
to talk about before we all bounce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go wrangle a five year old beast.
Beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, Friday night isn't the
easiest night for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we super appreciate you coming on and
shooting the ship and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I briefly saw your face in
the shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for a minute before the pitch
black kicked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, that's that's kind of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to chat about, you know,
we wanted to chat about the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to clear up some misconceptions
and we wanted people to hear about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the specifics of what was available,
how it was made, what you what we saw in
[SPEAKER_00]: it and let people go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as always, everyone, thank you for
giving us part of your Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Caleb, were you where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can people find your seats again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble CSI dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll grab the NL five, please experience
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you let them know about yours,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, support the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, both both both guys have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them both off each of their
individual websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were communicating a bunch during the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about what he was
seeing, sharing pictures and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's how a lot of it's
how a lot of passion projects get made
[SPEAKER_00]: today is with people that have similar
interests collaborating and making it
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So support it if you can, if you,
you know, it'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would spread out some old genetics
and it would keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could do your little part to make
sure that the gene pool stays wider and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully find some fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, everybody enjoy their
Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, there's a million questions we
didn't get to, but you can always hit us
[SPEAKER_00]: up on our discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and I chat up there a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty responsive to questions and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, every every Friday
night, we'll try to bring you something
[SPEAKER_00]: new and pertinent and interesting and
bring on various friends we have and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of just push the history and the
info forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the very least, you can see not so
naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a great night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
