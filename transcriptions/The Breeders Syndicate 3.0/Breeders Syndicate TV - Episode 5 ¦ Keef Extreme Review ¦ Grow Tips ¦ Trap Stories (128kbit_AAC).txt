[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Slowly blowing up in the can of world
things to Matt and crew and I just wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to say I appreciate you Thanks for all the
love the support the messages although all
[SPEAKER_01]: y 'all everybody gals girls men's Every
one of y'all I got messages from the south
[SPEAKER_01]: to the dirty south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody right me saying hey Chuck dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you, bro I'm from the south.

appreciate y'all and I appreciate the
[SPEAKER_01]: support You know y'all who I do it for I
do it for everybody But I you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a special place for all my homies
down south, you know But it is what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to also say we got it wrong on
the last episode y'all and I apologize The
[SPEAKER_01]: blue sushi that I got was not blue sushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have looked more into the cross,
but I was lazy I just I got consumed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the blueberry smell and I just assumed
Blue means blueberry in the blue sushi,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it apparently it was you know,
kush mints crossed or whatever I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really know and I don't particularly care
a whole lot But that's part of going
[SPEAKER_01]: through the rec stores you guys you get
ripped off sometimes and that's a lesson
[SPEAKER_01]: learned You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say I met was extremely
dissatisfied with what I got not really
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm used to hood packs I'm used to things
are being named what they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be it is what it is I thought it was more
interesting that it had a blueberry Terps
[SPEAKER_01]: do blueberry kind of flavored to it smell
or not flavor But a smell similar to the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry I X from Matt and that's that's
really what I took away from that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: little experience But speaking of
dispensaries, we got a little show for y
[SPEAKER_01]: 'all today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm keeping an extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jacked up jacked off I'm jacked up on
Keith Extreme if y'all don't know what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is in the intro, you know, what the heck
this guy's buying drinks are little Fizzy
[SPEAKER_01]: pop soda pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They say out, you know in the middle of
the country up north a soda pop We say
[SPEAKER_01]: coke in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's coke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It don't matter if it's Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a coke I want a coke, but I want
the Mount a Mountain Dew Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the main thing is I'm jacked up on
Keefe extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said in the intro I don't know
anything about these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked a little bit up about them,
you know Tell me in the comments if you
[SPEAKER_01]: know something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know it Educate me you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to learn with y'all I'm here to
go teach a little bit, but I'm here to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn but we're jacked up on on Keith a
Bunch of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drink a grape one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well heck we'll crack this one open too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gonna get we gonna get lit I mean once
you pop the top the freakin fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stop you guys gals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pull that tab back there right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mmm root beer That's pretty good actually
I like that I Probably should have shook
[SPEAKER_01]: it up a little bit just shake it a little
bit now now Back on topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Keefe extreme flowing through
our blood, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I should probably do some kind
of review on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I'm not good at reviews,
but I will say last night I drink a
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberry one I sipped on it And they got
me a nice good buzz going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hardcore stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking all day long And I felt like
they did me pretty good, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little felt a little groggy this
morning I will say I drink it later at
[SPEAKER_01]: night So I did feel a little groggy this
morning when I woke up I'm not a big soda
[SPEAKER_01]: pop guy would probably probably prefer a
juice But these things are pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you just happen one or two a
week or something You know kind of hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: out sipping on a little little Keefe
extreme keeping an extreme, you know As
[SPEAKER_01]: far as like the flavor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price was decent at the little
dispensary I went to and picked them up
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a little deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like three for twenty or something
like that, which wasn't really that bad
[SPEAKER_01]: considering You know you get you little
little get you a little buzz little head
[SPEAKER_01]: change off of it You know this ain't
something I'd probably drink all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm not a big edible guys cuz
Edible guy cuz I'll be honest y'all know
[SPEAKER_01]: me in the discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go off on tangents when I go crazy I
push it to the extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to get catch a little high
I'm trying to go to the another dimension
[SPEAKER_01]: and go through a you know freaking Vortex
portal and time to revisit myself while
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoned and kiss myself and lick on
Lick myself, you know shit like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but You know, I try them when I do
partake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like these drinks I had a drink
before out in Colorado that I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: love sometimes they got a little weird
aftertaste with some of these products
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, but the one I had out there had
a Penic a lot of like banana flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh It hit right dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that a little bit before
shit was more regulated, too So it was
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an adventure I went out there to
the rock and mineral show out there in
[SPEAKER_01]: Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Boulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out, Colorado I appreciate it y'all
to y'all have a beautiful state Shout out,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky as always shout out the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Kelly shout out Michigan as
always Michigan baby, but I appreciate all
[SPEAKER_01]: the sport support from y'all, especially
in the Michigan people Y 'all y'all are
[SPEAKER_01]: too sweet to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send me the kindest messages and I
really do appreciate it You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not gonna be easy peasy all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got us this thing will be a smooth
transition You know Matt in the show has
[SPEAKER_01]: went through a lot of ups and downs over
the years and you know It's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: different y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to hijack a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to show I'm here to entertain you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to show off the plants the whole
plan was originally for me to Really come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and do some plant videos and stuff like
that occasionally, but the way things have
[SPEAKER_01]: happened I'm having been able to do that
because of all the YouTube strikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got another channel I'm working
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't gonna be rec weed products all
the time I got two weeks on the harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're gonna go through some CSI Matt
blue sours TK times pure OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna go sour diesel times You know
pure OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna try all these different little
Little strange skank dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got skank dogs and flowers man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got blue dream crosses and flowers are
getting close to Semi-close to getting
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got stuff on the horizon The what
I'm waiting for this weather to shift y
[SPEAKER_01]: 'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a garage right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm freezing my balls off I can't you
know, I'm I'm a Kentucky boy, but dad and
[SPEAKER_01]: Papa always said cold weather makes hard
men and women and you know We gotta get it
[SPEAKER_01]: right these days, but You know,
I'd said you got a point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the south where it's warm and
it's hot I work all day in 90 to 100
[SPEAKER_01]: degree weather and that's hot so,
you know You put a you put a Kentucky guy
[SPEAKER_01]: up here in Michigan and what do you get a
freaking super saying you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the Messiah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming to save the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to come and I'm coming to save
you guys I'm here to come to save the
[SPEAKER_01]: at-tent home growers are really doing this
guys, but You know, we won't always be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a wreck weed products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't like to do that It's just
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran out of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was sick I had thrips things just
happened the way they did so I ran out of
[SPEAKER_01]: blood, you know I could get a favor,
but I'm not trying to get favors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like favors You always get favors
you get start owning everybody a favor and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you don't want to be that guy So we
just deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke a little wreck weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke a little You know, I got some
some random outdoor shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke on as well Too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bunch of the rank stranger jars
that I've been smoking on here or there
[SPEAKER_01]: too, but man I can't smoke a lot of that
hate shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start getting paranoid you guys I start
looking out the window like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know nowadays people don't even pull
up an Amazon shit anymore You guys you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even had vans bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They the other night somebody pulled up at
like 830 at night and nobody pulls up
[SPEAKER_01]: hardly ever right and they pull up Lights
on SUV looking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know a Hummer or something And
dogs are barking and I'm thinking like
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look out the window and I see this
little beanpole of a man Running through
[SPEAKER_01]: my yard with it And I'm as he's running
back to his little car.
[SPEAKER_01]: His phone is this way, bro And he snaps a
picture like the most skillfully I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in life when he sent me the picture
You know on the delivery confirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a perfect picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought to myself this guy I if I had a
company I would hire this guy because the
[SPEAKER_01]: skill that takes the precision the
precision the you know sense of urgency
[SPEAKER_01]: the Efficiency you could say I love I
loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so anyways Back to look we jump it
all off topic you guys I know you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't mind so much But I try to keep
it on topic and I'll be honest the Keith
[SPEAKER_01]: is kicking in so I'm gonna be bouncing
around a little bit So just please please
[SPEAKER_01]: Forgive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so at the end of the day would I buy
Keith Keith's again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, yeah, I would I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like a tropical flavor Purple
passion is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like grape soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool root beer is cool,
but I like I'm a more of a tropical guy
[SPEAKER_01]: like a coconut Pina colada Pineapple kind
of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't you saying that kind of sounds a
little fruity there truck dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: but hey, I like pina coladas I used to
love tequila I do wild shit on tequila,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can't go there no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a I'm in a real happy relationship
with a beautiful woman I can't be acting a
[SPEAKER_01]: fool out there howling at the moon late
night chasing around riff-raff chasing
[SPEAKER_01]: around little you know lot lizards or
whatever the things I used to do back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, but You know, I'd buy Keith
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bounced around today y'all by Keith
extreme and keep it extreme You know
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways Is there any products any edibles
any drinks that you have in your local
[SPEAKER_01]: area special especially in the Michigan
area?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that could try to track down and
try out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know in the comment section below
Let me know what what I should try to find
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for some of the bud that you
guys recommend in the last ones But I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen much of that shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking around But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got something, you know,
you got a couple more weeks of me buying
[SPEAKER_01]: some rec weaves So if you got something
you want me to try out Or find or buy or
[SPEAKER_01]: products to try out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know in the comment section below
Let me if you don't care at all if you
[SPEAKER_01]: think rec weed sucks, and you think I'm I
suck Let me know that too down there shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets me hyped up you guys, you know
Anytime you guys take effort out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: all's life or energies to watch a little
bit of my video I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a negative or a positive comment is
appreciated It really doesn't matter but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know this show thrives off of
engagement with you guys and gals out
[SPEAKER_01]: there Let me know I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if I'm doing bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying the best I can, you know,
I'm not gonna be the best at it I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get everything right every single
time I can really only speak from my own
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences and tell you guys that So if
you guys got tips for me my egos in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hot tub and that's where I left it So out
there Lake St. Clair with Denali and crew
[SPEAKER_01]: I left it in there that night They
punished me and took me and took me in
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that I could have never even imagined
And I left my ego in that mazola soaked
[SPEAKER_01]: lubed up hot tub And you know if you got
something to tell me or teach me or you
[SPEAKER_01]: got an opinion or something Let me know
I'm trying to be a better grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be a better podcaster guy
I'm trying to be a better person in life,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know A lot of people get it twisted,
you know, you know in this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of drama and stuff like that
You know, I'm not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna be leaving Matt I'm gonna be
rocking out with the breeder syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be doing what I got to do into a
Gone basically to the to the death of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't get it twisted I ain't going
anywhere if you like it you like it if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you don't it is what it is and that
being said Let's go ahead and jump over
[SPEAKER_01]: into the products I use during my grows at
least that the ones I have been using this
[SPEAKER_01]: run, you know I'm kind of like bitter in
some of the other Guys recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I you know, don't really necessarily like
to stick to one product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really about that It's really
about what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's cheap?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's available?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need it in a specific time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I gonna be able to get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have it at the hydro store?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I gotta go through Amazon?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several several variables that go
into that and really my biggest advice is
[SPEAKER_01]: if you got something that you're looking
at This may be a little bit too expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to go Into a hydro store and you could
do this online as well as well But I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: visual person and it helps me when I have
everything in front of me try to go and
[SPEAKER_01]: look through different products and look
for the similar ingredients or what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to You know replace or substitute
for and this ain't gonna work for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything because there are some products
that are Specialized or not specialized or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but for me, we'll talk about it here in
a minute About the can of bloom and a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of the other can of line products
that I really can't afford or don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay for it and I've substituted a few
things So we're gonna jump into what I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is gonna be for people that are
new beginners People that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: starting out out, you know that don't
really know what they're doing Maybe or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you do know what you're doing,
but you're looking for a new strategy You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I'm not an organic grower as far as
organics are concerned It's about as
[SPEAKER_01]: organic as I can get is when I grow
outside in the dirt and that's about as
[SPEAKER_01]: organics as it gets, you know I lit,
you know, I got to climb stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to take stuff up a couple flights of
stairs So I'm not really trying to carry
[SPEAKER_01]: You know a bunch of crap up into the house
other than I really need to and in all
[SPEAKER_01]: truthfulness I would switch the cocoa if I
you know If I mean if I just had the
[SPEAKER_01]: products, I mean, I probably would switch
the cocoa I got the cocoa can of A and B
[SPEAKER_01]: products But you know, it's a hard
switching up or doing multiple different
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques of Styles of growing at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting to do some cocoa I've
done a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some veg and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you know, cocoa is great I think
or cocoa choir, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great I've seen people in the
discourse shout out local and a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: people Bitter and a few a few of the other
guys and gals in the discord get great
[SPEAKER_01]: results from cocoa choir and stuff like
that Massive yields quick growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me personally, uh,
you know if I was gonna do cocoa I'd want
[SPEAKER_01]: to take clones into cocoa, you know,
I probably would mess up starting off in
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa It seems like a lot of people do
from what I can pick up from the discord a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people have trouble starting them
off in in the cocoa and that's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know Not giving enough or giving
a little bit too much of that because and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes people don't do stuff like pre
soak your meat You know your your whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing in basically and give it
some cow man Give it especially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need something to get going but
Personally, I like to start my Seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: pro mix because it's real airy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get a lot of You know air to
the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get quick growth,
especially in those beginning stages It
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have a lot of nitrogen and things
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna You know burn your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna get you where you need to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got about seven to ten days on pro mix
You know for your seedlings and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So And then you can start giving them some
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to start giving them real low dose
of you know, cow mag and The can of Tara
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually run the can of Tara lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Stuff I have the most
experience with I do have can of a and B
[SPEAKER_01]: for cocoa But I don't really use it a lot
and I haven't used it a lot so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: really only speak about The can of Tara
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump in that and I'm starting to
slur my words a little bit I could tell
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm slowing down and because they keep
extreme just keeping it extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please bear with me and let's make it
through you know, I try not to smoke a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever today so I am I'm running on a
Pretty empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did make some pizza But I just took a
few bites to get me through the show
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like you know when you got
an empty stomach You know, it's just gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: hit you a little harder, you know,
so I will say we're gonna jump over into
[SPEAKER_01]: the products We've been trying to get to
it for almost 20 minutes and I do
[SPEAKER_01]: apologize, but let's get to it Also if you
doubt you feel a little dab hoe and You
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to wonder what torch you want to
get pick up one of these freaking things
[SPEAKER_01]: Do blazer big shot GT 8,000 they make
different ones different product,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know different levels different sizes
different numbers There's probably a GT
[SPEAKER_01]: 69.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope a 420 whatever, you know,
these things are pretty cool I like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great for dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Ain't a big-time dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I do dab, this is what I'm using
I Ain't sponsored by none of these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: gals, but if you want to hook me up Let's
get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't make no ad revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get it popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, first things first Some people
you don't got a pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but I would recommend Get
familiar with your water check your pH
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to be every day But check it
often because it can fluctuate for
[SPEAKER_01]: example, I'm running off well water I
check my pH every single day Because if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's raining or if it's dry, my pH is
gonna fluctuate dramatically dependent,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also when you're adding nutrients to your
water, give it a little bit time to chill
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, just mix it up five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it chill then go ahead and pH it after
that You don't be mixing shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got you got to let it balance out
balance that pH a little bit especially
[SPEAKER_01]: drunk be dumping can of like for example
the can of Tara stuff that I use for For
[SPEAKER_01]: during flower that stuff will drop your pH
from like seven or eight if you starting
[SPEAKER_01]: you put that in there It'll drop it all
the way down to like four or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's freaking crazy So make sure you're
checking your pH use guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it's simple You can use a pen
the blue lab pens work good the more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive probes were good But personally
I got away from using them because I felt
[SPEAKER_01]: like every time I was turning around they
were drying out I was dropping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was breaking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were breaking on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually just used the general
hydroponics Little color.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call this little thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what it's called a
little test indicator with the different
[SPEAKER_01]: colors on it All you do is you fill up
this bottle halfway and put in three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five drops in there And you match
it up with the colors, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're colorblind, it's probably gonna
help you out much So you pay gonna stick
[SPEAKER_01]: to a paint pin, but this is what helped
that works for me You know my stuff's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty consistent because I do run
everything through an RO system People say
[SPEAKER_01]: truck now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you running through an RO system
wasting all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: money and power in a water well The the
well water I have comes out anywhere from
[SPEAKER_01]: three four hundred PPMs bros I don't know
what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say it's fine, but I ain't risking it
for the biscuit I want to start at a base
[SPEAKER_01]: level a neutral level or not a neutral
level I guess I should say but just I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to start at zero I don't want nothing in
that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know what I'm putting in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how I can keep track of it I know
exactly what's going into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist You guys I can't tell
you what's biologically on a biological
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in that soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know I just know that at
the end of the day I need Mountain Dew Kim
[SPEAKER_01]: dog blunts and big titties and Your plants
gonna need stuff to just like a human
[SPEAKER_01]: being would you know, they need stuff and
they need You know nitrogen phosphorous
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need micronutrients cow mags.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need Amino acids all this stuff that
is really over my head and probably a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of over your guys's head But the thing
that you got to remember is hours and the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience are required to grow cannabis
greatly I you know, you can come in you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get a good run or two and You could
have a bad run from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it all the way Environments
range all over the place guys gals Excuse
[SPEAKER_01]: me when I was in Kentucky I didn't have
any problems hardly ever No pest no p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problems whatsoever But the climate was
more stable there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have big fluctuations here in
Michigan You go from 70 degrees one day to
[SPEAKER_01]: the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 26 and it's snowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got big fluctuations so you have to
be Flexible you have to be elastic You
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be able to to learn and adapt
yourself to your garden at all time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there is a language that You can read
that you can speak to your plants and I
[SPEAKER_01]: ain't getting hippy-dippy on you I'm just
saying if you watch your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can read a language.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you what they need you know,
all we're doing is giving them what we
[SPEAKER_01]: think they need and Every plant and every
expression is gonna want different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna consume water at different
levels So there's no real right way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this or say this but at the end of the day
We're gonna give them a battery of food
[SPEAKER_01]: and nutrients micronutrients all these
Little things that they they they could
[SPEAKER_01]: need or not need potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know do we really we're
just throwing stuff in pots I feel like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bro science in and out, but they do need
stuff on a base level, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So You're gonna give them this little
battery pack, which is your pot of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what's gonna get you there But
sometimes if you like me you're growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: one gallon pots and what's in that one
gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ain't gonna get you all the way to flower,
bro Sometimes you you're growing from seed
[SPEAKER_01]: like your boy Chuck Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, all my grows are from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those Videos are from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you understand why I'm coming
from I've done taking my grows to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking level you guys and you can see it
in you could you could see it in the proof
[SPEAKER_01]: the proof is in the pudding they say in
the pictures in the videos so And your
[SPEAKER_01]: boys able to keep Kim 91 Happy,
okay ain't melting on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see me my Kim's melting on me
fam Cannibalizing hell no, that's for
[SPEAKER_01]: suckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day You know,
we lost track the keeps getting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on we're talking about Different
products and all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh batteries battery your battery bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're what do you play?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing in smaller pots,
you know You're going you don't need some
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need some some bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna need some dried amendments
You don't need however you gonna do it
[SPEAKER_01]: organic guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't got you really y'all up here
Harvesting kelp out the ocean and sprinkle
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plants I don't really know you
guys got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bring we're gonna bring some organic
guys on here We're gonna have them teach
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys how to do the organics,
you know, but you know your plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: weed They'll grow anywhere almost any
conditions for the most part They don't
[SPEAKER_01]: they can use a lot of this they can go
without a lot of that So, you know your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are never going to die on you
overnight If you're new just be patient
[SPEAKER_01]: growing weed is all about patience and
just being vigilant and watching your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and trying to be preventative so
before you have run into problems or and
[SPEAKER_01]: just keeping your environment stable and
And to where your plant can really enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: its health or enjoy itself and get that
good health fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it's about so You really want
to start off pH that's gonna help you out
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot Especially if you're doing what I'm
doing you want to pH guys and really you
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all kinds of products out there I
know you guys ain't gonna say will you get
[SPEAKER_01]: some citric acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can't I've heard it a million
times from you guys But I just me I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about what I use cuz I'm lame like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just order shit, right pH up pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this one pH down Acid fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know y'all know about some acid Maybe
we'll talk about some acid stories on one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the shows here coming up not today
though But you gotta get you some pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I like to have on hand at
all times is cloning gel It comes in many
[SPEAKER_01]: different sizes many shapes many Different
varieties it comes in powders and gels and
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays and dips and chips and salsa man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting hungry But I just ordered this
cheap shit off at Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used clone X.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used other products They all work
about the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rooting compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a Here I'll show it up to the
camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't really care I don't got enough time
to break down every single company that I
[SPEAKER_01]: buy stuff from and If I you know in and
figure out if they What they've done in
[SPEAKER_01]: their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all buy products all the time You know,
you're going to Walmart you buy a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: soda pops You don't you're not thinking
about the the owners of the stuff who
[SPEAKER_01]: cares, you know I'm trying to I'm just
trying to put on a show for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You guys want to know how I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing you're gonna need
Measurement device don't be in there with
[SPEAKER_01]: a one millimeter vial dip in, you know One
millimeter here or there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's weak sissy shit these plants
They could take a lot more than that guys
[SPEAKER_01]: get you something to measure your shit out
with so you can know see When you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this you're getting data You should be you
should be you don't have to be writing it
[SPEAKER_01]: down because some people gonna be in
places that you probably shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: writing shit down but Take mental notes
when this plant is this age and I'm giving
[SPEAKER_01]: it this much How's it responding and when
you do this with hundreds of plants over a
[SPEAKER_01]: long period Of time thousands of plants,
whatever your gig is you're gonna see
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns and you shouldn't at least you
should notice patterns You also I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend if you're doing a can of product
or any product always follow their little
[SPEAKER_01]: charts online I love canna because they
you know the little bit more expensive on
[SPEAKER_01]: the expensive side on a lot of their
products But I do love their their A&B and
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love their the Terra and the Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is or however you say it And I
do love their little charts that they got
[SPEAKER_01]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a five gallon bottle Bucket to mix
all my stuff up in and that and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what I like to use You know, I like to use
little charts and I and I they have
[SPEAKER_01]: different options on there for light
feeding normal feeding heavy feeding So if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're new start with the light feeding,
you know what I mean go through it Don't
[SPEAKER_01]: ramp up to heavy feeding trying to get
them to pump go easy on them, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in those first few weeks of their life
Especially, you know, yeah, let them
[SPEAKER_01]: chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you especially when you get in a
flower Pump them some bitches,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I'm saying and there's nothing
wrong with that Y 'all you want to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest yields you only got so many rows
in your lifetime You know I'm saying if
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody said, you know, you can only
drive a car 50 more times in your lifetime
[SPEAKER_01]: or a truck Whatever have you snowmobile,
you know stripper, whatever Do you want
[SPEAKER_01]: the best or you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do the best or you want to go
slow and you're in a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't go fast I won't go fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fast guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing fast shit, you know,
that's what that's what it is efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about that That's what I like to
do, you know, some people won't leave
[SPEAKER_01]: nasty comments say you don't know what
you're talking about Chuck You don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really grow whatever go look at the
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I don't know who wouldn't smoke that I'm
getting more compliments than I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: got so I know it's not just in my brain
I'm seeing it visually all this language
[SPEAKER_01]: that we talk about we we see the changes
in our plants We see the visual changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see them perk up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see him turn green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see them beautiful We look at everybody
else's grows when we think to ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck are they doing but That being said
Let's keep it rocking another important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing calm it some people don't like cow
mag Some people like to get it from other
[SPEAKER_01]: other ways, you know, whatever thing I
like about cow mag is you can never really
[SPEAKER_01]: give a plant too much of it Just follow
the back one to five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's one to three millimeter
milliliters per gallon When you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting off a plant go light guys one
milliliters fine But then as you get up
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're starting to get you know,
a lot of growth and especially in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, you know You won't want to be
doing I think it's like five five per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon So 25 milliliters if you're you
know, doing a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, so just use common sense start
low rev up Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will say on cow mag Things like you
Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even a couple my triangle Kush s
ones Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah triangle a couple other a couple
other plants, especially in this run This
[SPEAKER_01]: ain't gonna be in that ain't gonna be
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to give them more of this Or you
can use some of these other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to show but you definitely need
your cow mag guys You know cow makes super
[SPEAKER_01]: important a lot of people will underuse it
a lot of people don't realize they could
[SPEAKER_01]: just simply fix their plants You know,
I can't really show you guys pictures and
[SPEAKER_01]: break it down For everything on here
because we'll get another strike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to we're working on that
though We're gonna work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna fix problems on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna grow we're gonna do stuff for
y'all on camera I got a new camera coming
[SPEAKER_01]: at new microphones on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more games.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more Surrender no retreat chug dogs
here to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to freakin battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going we're building the army right
now We're doing everything we need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Troy over.

shit his pants on love Go check him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whatever we'll make we're
building the community, you know,

That's what we want to do y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to smoke we want to make friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have a good time cow mag Can
never have too much of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Mess the video up there for saying but

[SPEAKER_01]: two flying around for a day But I give
them hell with this and it takes it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: care of them get you some of these the
dunks stuff Holy shit the dunks the

You know sometimes suffering is good for
[SPEAKER_01]: you Remember that you gotta go through the
struggles of life in the pain of life to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out on top You got to experience you
gotta go through bad the good the mediocre
[SPEAKER_01]: the boring the exciting to become the
ultimate human being The thing I Love to
[SPEAKER_01]: use is the recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different probably better
products, you know, whatever I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: recharge not really Because it's the
greatest thing in the world, but I got
[SPEAKER_01]: some of it and it was cheap at the time
I've had it for a little while but I like
[SPEAKER_01]: this for my little You know my little
assets and things like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got a lot of you know Just look on
the back of your product products guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you got to do Look up what a
cannabis requires and look on the back of
[SPEAKER_01]: your product Do some reading don't just
watch videos like these and say oh like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the best thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: No You can use all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use this you use cheap
stuff Don't think just because your
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite youtuber uses this this thing
that it's the best in the world Sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just that this is what it was at the
store This is what I was I was I was
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking baked out of my mind when she let
a hydro store and then do Was like you
[SPEAKER_01]: need some of this sometimes it's uh,
you know, the packaging looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes, you know It could be a
lot of things But you know you look on the
[SPEAKER_01]: back of stuff and it tells you all the
shit that it has, you know get your fulvic
[SPEAKER_01]: acids All that stuff I you know,
I'm not gonna break it all down for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist You know, I listen I
just listen to the guys that tell me what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do You know join the discord join the
breeder syndicate discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get some knowledge?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm implementing everything I've been
taught from those guys those gals shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out peaches shout out miss Jill by the
way, miss Jill We got that TJC space glue
[SPEAKER_01]: rocking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Matt There's a freebies got the
space glue got a better camera coming on
[SPEAKER_01]: the way guys and gals I promise you I
spent $200 on his freaking swivel camera,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude It just things on a motorized deal
where it's gonna turn and everything I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna set up a little spot over here So
you could follow me from there to over
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the garage and we're gonna do some
videos Like I said, we're gonna rock out

[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know We're gonna find a keeper
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta find something good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta find something good You know Rob
saying they ain't gonna be no more skank
[SPEAKER_01]: dog seeds So I'm a little bummed about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to hold on to these with
everything we got Shout out seed trip Rob,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I'm loving this skank dog I got
three or four of them going right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: another two chilling and veg just waiting
I'm loving it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, so We got the skank dogs we
got the the glue space glue in this week
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple other things, but we're
gonna keep it on the grow products I just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to shut up miss Jill there for a
second another one that I like that I that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest I really didn't find much
use for it before in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time I was a pretty Noobs noob
still I would say or newer I'm still a new
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know I didn't realize how much
calcium and stuff was in minerals and
[SPEAKER_01]: things were in my water in the city water
down there So when I implemented some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these products before I didn't really
notice a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we said earlier some of you people
ain't gonna need some of these products,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when I'm using an RO and This product
here in particular is a guy green basalt
[SPEAKER_01]: rock dust and all it is is some minerals
bro We got some calcium in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some main magnesium We got some
iron and we got some manganese and really
[SPEAKER_01]: what what this is is when we're talking
about earlier with cow mag if it ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: enough You know, it's gonna be some of
these products gonna be lacking Stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: could be important for your plants or
whatever, you know I don't know if they do
[SPEAKER_01]: that on purpose on some of these products
They obviously do with like the can of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and like that there's certain
products in the lines like the can of
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom It's gonna be expensive When $400 or
five liter when one of these is like I
[SPEAKER_01]: think like 70 bucks for the Terra Vega So
same size 500 bucks, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's it is what it is They got
they're gonna charge more for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff certain ingredients require more
money to do you know to make or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part you can substitute
or find different products to help you on
[SPEAKER_01]: your little way I love implementing the
any kind of dry amendment like this
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for like my chem 191 stuff like
that, especially when I mix up my soil I
[SPEAKER_01]: had a little bit is bit into this as well
and you know And you would think all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff gonna burn your plants guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think he's gonna ruin your garden I
used to be that guy I used to think dang
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm just gonna grow with with you
know, like ocean I'm gonna grow with you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, mixing a little strawberry or
whatever Sprout and frog but now the way
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it now and I should have said
this earlier But I like to use ocean for
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in I love it, you know gets a lot
of nitrogen nitrogen and other things in
[SPEAKER_01]: there And I like to just pack that in
there and grow in that and that being said
[SPEAKER_01]: there's different options I like to use
that because I can use the Terra line from
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great It's a line that's
specially, you know designed, you know to
[SPEAKER_01]: be growing in and stuff It's already got
food and nitrogen things like that already
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So At the end of the day The guy green or
any kind of dry amendment like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just really giving it Making it
available for the plant if it needs it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you ain't trying to go overboard
But there are some plants that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: require more if you see when it's having
problems You know, you can give us some
[SPEAKER_01]: dry amendments now mind you sometimes dry
amendments ain't gonna be your answer
[SPEAKER_01]: because sometimes they are slow release or
sometimes they just take a while to be
[SPEAKER_01]: active in the soil or being broke down
into the soil to be you know available for
[SPEAKER_01]: the Plant basically, so that's that that
being said you gotta be Be conscious and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like do some reading and do a
little research on that kind of stuff I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just explaining it to you how I do I
really like to use that kind of stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: like a preventative thing So if I slack
off or miss something and it's just there
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil ready to rot and I'm seeing
great results with that for you know for
[SPEAKER_01]: my main nutrient and Veg as the Terra Vega
Which you know, it is more expensive guys
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be more expensive than probably
what you really need to ever buy But at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the day, it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't changed their product for
like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing It's the same
ingredients supposedly I never burn my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great Especially with the ocean
and like I was saying all these things I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: showing today It's working great for me
and I'm having great results and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: the videos and The pick the proof is there
it's already there So I love it for veg
[SPEAKER_01]: and man when you're in veg using this
stuff Don't be afraid to use it every day
[SPEAKER_01]: every other day That's what it's designed
for especially as your plants use up your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil the food in the soil or in the ocean
or whatever You're using don't be afraid
[SPEAKER_01]: to give it give it to them Just follow the
follow what they recommend and it won't
[SPEAKER_01]: let you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have much to worry about another
product I really like to use And this is
[SPEAKER_01]: like a once a week deal every ten days
It's some good old Mendo honey molasses
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a newer product I just started
using and You know, I can't tell you if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's making it a giant drastic change in
my garden but because I don't run the can
[SPEAKER_01]: of Bloom like the boom boost booster and
stuff like that and a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: products from canna I like to use a few
things to kind of kind of fill in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blank, you know, and this is the Mendocino
honey, like I said, I just started using
[SPEAKER_01]: it There's other products you could pick
up but really like I said, you always just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to look at the back of your
ingredients and This here is made it got a
[SPEAKER_01]: total nitrogen point forty six point four
six percent It's got Different Let's see
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate phosphate I can't talk you guys
I'm fucked up on these keep you just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: drink soluble potash You get your cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let you get your P and your K from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say that y'all Jesus available
Yeah, so strive for molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean It's a newer product that I've been
using just to boost my P in my case Not
[SPEAKER_01]: really using it for nitrogen or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're gonna you're gonna get all this
shit you need from this and your cow mag
[SPEAKER_01]: and your Terra but Next thing when you're
going into flour that I like to use For
[SPEAKER_01]: flour, I guess I should say mainly is the
Terra Flores and You know It's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: product as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pump them hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just follow the chart And it works
pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any major problems or
anything at all really It's been a great
[SPEAKER_01]: great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used bio biz and a few of the other
products I and I've burned my plants I've
[SPEAKER_01]: done, you know, I feel like this is just a
user-friendly really easy to use product
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a little bit more an expensive side,
but it works good and it's reliable and
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when you're talking about pump
popping a bunch of seeds You know and
[SPEAKER_01]: different expressions different cultivars
You know you want something you could be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to apply on a broad scale to to many
different things many cuts seeds Whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it is and be successful That's really what
it comes down to you want to get that to
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of your flower You get that get
that good smoke get them seeds or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: may may have you whatever you're doing But
like I said use the Flores I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: how you say how you say it I don't even
read it really to be honest with you
[SPEAKER_01]: Flores Flores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know Terra Flores and then We got
another product I've been Using recent
[SPEAKER_01]: recently is a mother of all blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a boom booster because I don't
use the Kana one I use this this in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with This is I think total
like 40 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's like the bloom booster is like 400
bucks So I don't know I'd like to save
[SPEAKER_01]: some money so I can spend them on my
Mountain Dews my whole tags and shit shit
[SPEAKER_01]: like that but you know, this is just gonna
give you your The way you use this I
[SPEAKER_01]: should say is you're gonna use it and when
you begin enough flower and then like
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the end of it your last not your
last few weeks, but you know, like just
[SPEAKER_01]: basically like we well We won't say a week
because there's gonna be people out there
[SPEAKER_01]: doing them different varieties of stuff
But I know you know seven to nine ten week
[SPEAKER_01]: plant you're gonna be using this,
you know, three or four weeks before the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, you know before harvest, but you just
all it's doing is you know boosting up
[SPEAKER_01]: your phosphorus and potassium levels get
you going and Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just follow the the back, you know,
it's like a tablespoon per gallon or add
[SPEAKER_01]: more add less depending on where you're at
You know that the actual directions of it
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you know Can be used first week of
flower to help introduce flowering Add
[SPEAKER_01]: mother all blooms during the last two to
three weeks of flowering for added levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of phosphorus and potassium The mount
based nutrients may need to be reduced as
[SPEAKER_01]: such as 50% when using mother of all
blooms Overfeeding may burn plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it this run and if you know
haven't burnt any plants You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I was saying earlier, I'm not a
scientist I don't know if this stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: working or not other than what I can
visually see I'm not in I'm not you know
[SPEAKER_01]: this tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't look in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I'm not in I don't got a PhD
So all I can tell you is my plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger and better plants I ran before same
cultivars are bigger and better even hell
[SPEAKER_01]: even some of the auto flowers I ran
recently were bigger I mean the top the
[SPEAKER_01]: top cola on these ones were so big Bro
compared to the ones the same genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: around before So I don't know I kind of
feel like I'm getting what I paid for if
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes any sense And I'm stretching
these out over several grows So it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're using this all up real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, that's pretty
pretty much it You know, if you guys got
[SPEAKER_01]: something to recommend me to use I know I
could do it better always and use the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual canner products You know and stuff
like that but If you guys got something
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend me to use down in the comment
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know below below I love trying out
new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I'm liking the way my shit's
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm having a good time Anyways,
last thing I wanted to talk about today
[SPEAKER_01]: for y'all as far as growing tips and
growing equipment I know y'all seen these
[SPEAKER_01]: before this is a trim tray right here They
usually come with a like a black bottom or
[SPEAKER_01]: a bottom piece so you can collect your
little little Stuff that falls through
[SPEAKER_01]: your pollens or your little hash or
whatever you get whatever you got for
[SPEAKER_01]: mama's but Speaking of mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't beat my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: She don't hit me hit me right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah on my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: She don't hit me with the fucking hibachi
Magic vibrating one, you know in big ones
[SPEAKER_01]: all the women's they have to use on their
coochies She hit me across the head of the
[SPEAKER_01]: forehead the other day I was trying to get
her a little a little $50 square up with
[SPEAKER_01]: her and she came right down The house with
that thing welded it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said what you doing back here boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: She met me across the forehead and that's
how I got that cut right there So me and
[SPEAKER_01]: mom ain't real good right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch it, I love you I'll be if you
want to drop me off a plate of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great But trim trays they come
many different shapes many different sizes
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this one here because it's the
first one I bought and I've had it for
[SPEAKER_01]: many years It works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it in the dishwasher get
nice and clean once you get done with it
[SPEAKER_01]: get a little pollens Off there have you
but mainly I wanted to talk about just for
[SPEAKER_01]: using When you're sorting seeds,
you know, a lot of people ask questions
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had questions like this when I
started off How do you separate your seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from all that buds and all that all that
crap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do I get my seeds out of there,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how you're doing it Well,
if you don't have a seed separator or a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed separating machine where we won't
call it They make those you can there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple guys on Instagram and there's plan
plans for them On the internet you can
[SPEAKER_01]: download to get your little seed blower
going and help you clean them But if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're cheap like me and you ain't got a
lot of money or space You could use a tray
[SPEAKER_01]: like these and I like this one here
particular because it has the screen and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little lip right there because what
happens is You don't take your tray like
[SPEAKER_01]: this and you could take it like that if
you want But I like to take it just like
[SPEAKER_01]: this I'll take my little all my little
buds and my dried up stuff my season my
[SPEAKER_01]: chaff and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start Crunching it up just like that
as I'm doing it them seeds are bouncing
[SPEAKER_01]: down this tray You want to have it at an
angle and them a lot of times them seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: will bounce over at white lip right there
and catch right here for you saw and in
[SPEAKER_01]: all your your shake and your trim and all
that stuff will be caught up here and You
[SPEAKER_01]: simply just tilt it or you can pick them
up tilt your seeds out and get them out
[SPEAKER_01]: that way and you sometimes you have To do
a few runs depending how much seed you got
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how dry it is how not dry it
is whatever, but for the most part you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do is when it's really dry and
It's really the best time and only time
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to do it Sometimes like me
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have harvested stuff just to try it out
You know when it's still wet and do it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it works You don't want to do it
that way necessarily, but it does work But
[SPEAKER_01]: another thing you could do to use this for
sorting seeds is put it like this Just
[SPEAKER_01]: like how I'm sitting in front of you and
you want to mount you a little fan kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like basically I almost got a booger in my
nose get you a little fan pointing it away
[SPEAKER_01]: from you or to the side of you I like to
do it away from you, and I'll put that
[SPEAKER_01]: little tray right there in front of it
with the in between Have the fan in
[SPEAKER_01]: between you and the tray and have that
tray kind of tilt it up like that You
[SPEAKER_01]: won't play around with you don't put it on
full blast and blow all your seeds out But
[SPEAKER_01]: you turn you get that fan going and you
just take that all that shake and your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and everything you shake take It
right there in front of that fan and have
[SPEAKER_01]: this below it You know blow out a lot of
that crap out for you blow all that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: shit out for you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll collect all your seeds down
here at the bottom of your tray And that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just that's just how you have a good day
when you're sorting the seeds some people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like it Some people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like sorting the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's freaking fun I got ADHD so it
helps me keep focused and gives me
[SPEAKER_01]: something to do and I guess really
actually a lot I think the last tip for
[SPEAKER_01]: today I talked about this on the last
episode Denali shout out Denali You gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me these freaking What are these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydra Hydra farm, I don't know anything
about hydro farm, but these These are
[SPEAKER_01]: little Trimmers bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: These have been fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't broke a lot of these trimmers
out here I get the freaking spring pops
[SPEAKER_01]: out of them these things have stayed sharp
these have been awesome They got them at
[SPEAKER_01]: the hydro stores a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know some people don't got go to hydro
stores I got them, but you know Maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: could find that that's a great Great great
product great works great for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My balls were balls are itching kind of
for real But I guess really that's it as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as the grow tips are concerned for
today I hope that's helped y'all out some
[SPEAKER_01]: if it hasn't let me know I know it's gonna
be boring for some of y'all older cats out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but we're trying to attract some
new people We're trying to get it flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get it going, you know But I
like to jump over into a weeder tip I know
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are saying a weeder tip What the
hell is that got to do with weed bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a weed eater is it not I think
most of us are You know people of outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to keep stuff You know maintained
and keep stuff trimmed up if you got a
[SPEAKER_01]: little gorilla grow somewhere You won't
cut you a little spot you gonna take a
[SPEAKER_01]: weed eater up in there for you And get it
rocking you know so I wanted to give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: little weeder tip for today And I'm gonna
try to do this without unplugging a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff For knocking anything over here
real quick, but I got I might have to put
[SPEAKER_01]: my headset down for a second hold on I'll
be right back All
[SPEAKER_01]: right Y'all might know I spent a lifetime
cutting grass and letting it grow a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting it mainly but I used to weed A lot
I used to cut a lot of grass in Kentucky
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I got my job My boss said to me
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said when I was young when I was young
book and my thing was still hard He said
[SPEAKER_01]: you ever weed eat before I said yes,
sir I have he said well if you have let me
[SPEAKER_01]: see you string a weed eater So I got out
there 20 minutes Fumbling with that thing.

no more laying around out in your yard
[SPEAKER_01]: Playing with yourself in the weed eater
head trying to get it strong so This piece
[SPEAKER_01]: right here is too short But keep in mind
the shorter your string the higher your
[SPEAKER_01]: rpms are gonna be which means your head's
gonna spin faster due to the Less weight
[SPEAKER_01]: that is on the head Which can be a good
thing or a bad thing depending on where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at and what you're doing but in
residential Usually if I'm doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: residential property and it's been weeded
before or the week before especially And I
[SPEAKER_01]: just got to come in there and do a quick
quick cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna do a little bit of string I'm
gonna do a smaller string than this this
[SPEAKER_01]: string here is gonna be made more for
going through big shit like brush right
[SPEAKER_01]: now this kind of string comes with
Downside though too.

smaller piece of it together Get them rpms

[SPEAKER_01]: resupply your head on your head your weed
eater or your string trimmer Without even
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it off all right all I want you to

[SPEAKER_01]: steel steel or a husk of honor or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you using a Japanese Chinese piece
of equipment there, bud?

[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for many years I would
lift it up and show y'all, but we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna break something People say well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you use something more like a
steel those things are badass,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro You know I did a lot of residential
properties when I'm doing residential
[SPEAKER_01]: properties, and I'm getting in and out of
truck all day long I want something
[SPEAKER_01]: lightweight with high rpms that you know
I'm not listen guys We're hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use edgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do all we don't have multiple
equipment I do all my edger my beveling my
[SPEAKER_01]: weed eating heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even mow yards with this freaking thing
sometimes I'm not even kidding you there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some yards that are fancy, and I can't get
in I'm using a freaking weed eater no push
[SPEAKER_01]: more No more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ain't doing no push mowing pussy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like push mowing You know I push
mowed many years, and I'm not into it I
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'd rather take this puppy right
here, and you're burning down and look
