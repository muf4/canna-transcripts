[SPEAKER_02]: There we go Welcome
[SPEAKER_04]: back people coming back in Apologies for
those that don't know Instagram me to stop
[SPEAKER_04]: at the hour on the hour, so We're gonna
have hours Yo back all right people
[SPEAKER_04]: already joining back in we're back up to
128 So yeah, we can just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: start rolling Every once in a while like I
miss people writing stuff at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm just holding my phone So I'm
sorry if I missed questions or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, but Somebody said that I was
calling dude skunk Va instead of skunk VA
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to say that I'm having a real all
these people like I called them by their
[SPEAKER_00]: real names Yeah, these nicknames and stuff
like that that they get used on forums and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff This is not yeah, I speak of them,
so I'm trying real hard Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's keep everybody's personal business
personal business and and call them by
[SPEAKER_00]: their their IG handle or their nickname or
what I know of them as you know because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously like You know obviously like I
don't I don't call him by that ever you
[SPEAKER_00]: know so I'm trying to overcome my mental
You know just and just not just spout
[SPEAKER_00]: their name over and over again Of who they
are it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real hard, but yeah, you're doing a
great job because I knew skunk VA You know
[SPEAKER_00]: for you know years Before he jumped online
and created that handle for himself Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know very easy to call him his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't slipped it But but you
know I'm trying to be You know like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: our our our old compatriot that we call
the dude from Staten Island because he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have a nickname because he's never
been online really I'm trying with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying I mean every most people on
this thing probably know who chem dog is
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not gonna say his name out of
respect just because that you know so
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean you know Toast did Rasta
yeah, I mean the only thing that You know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there's a few things I'm known for
I guess I mean I got lucky and I cracked
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mendo perps which Probably our good
friend CSI is has bred and brought to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public more than anybody else yeah,
I just got Whether you want to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky or vibe or energy or whatever I just
got lucky and and Got any number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different cuttings and connections and
things that ended up being quite famous
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then there's a whole bunch of
Blah mystery and bullshit that gets viewed
[SPEAKER_00]: about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know yeah Yeah, he's he's being
fucking humble as fuck because that's who
[SPEAKER_04]: he is but but the reason I wanted to start
off my the podcast essentially With not a
[SPEAKER_04]: dog is because he is so integrated
integrally tied into so many fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that are a base of our whole
cannabis culture and he's And he's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: people But so he's not throwing his name
out there real big and he's just you know
[SPEAKER_04]: doing his thing I can't even get him to
fucking sell seeds for the life I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy's been breeding as long as I've
been alive, so yeah So far so far as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as seed going is that uh I had a pretty
like punk rock ethos with seeds and I bred
[SPEAKER_00]: him for me and for friends And we tried to
make things that we like and then I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: them out for free Yeah And So You know the
s ones of the Mendo perps rule dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend them I went up and
visited CSI, and he did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just did a big s1 test run and I got to
get a big testers pack of a bunch of the s
[SPEAKER_00]: ones and I am currently smoking them on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of variety in the
line and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes To you yeah, yeah, so I went up there
The day or two before he harvested yeah a
[SPEAKER_00]: few hours in that particular room He had
half the room was a bunch of Urkel s ones
[SPEAKER_00]: And half the and half the room was a bunch
of Mendo P s ones and we poked around and
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled a bunch of stuff And so yeah there
is Mendo P has a wide and it Luckily it
[SPEAKER_00]: has a wide variety of of genetics inside
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dark ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's Burgundy ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's light purple ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's green Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all black.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ones that like the bud is black,
but all the leaves are green Strangely and
[SPEAKER_00]: this I never expected to see this There
was actually even some kush and some pine
[SPEAKER_00]: soul in Maybe about 10% of them That was
pretty surprising to me, you know and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nicest ones harmed But I mean there
you go Blue skies Vienna, there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really a deal between any of us and blue
skies Vienna You know, I would I would
[SPEAKER_00]: call myself I'm pretty polite not in all
regards and Matt isn't so polite and so We
[SPEAKER_00]: both have a pretty limited patience for
bullshit, you know, and so, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody nobody would be happier for me to
see a whole bunch of rank roadkill skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: come back community But I it's a bummer
when people claim Things and then make a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of money off the public for six
months to a year to a year and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the word gets spread that they
don't really have what they have and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they viciously attack any One that wants
to fuck with their money train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so Matt is pretty famous For
calling out bullshit as he sees it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that endears him to some of us People take
offense to that, you know And he you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so he gets a bunch of blowback and
then he's willing to give as good as he
[SPEAKER_00]: gets At times like that and so,
you know, he has a number of enemies out
[SPEAKER_00]: there but most of his enemies are People
that have something to hide yeah in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion and and so they try to insult the
person without insulting the Quantity or
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of his argument, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of responding to the fact that
they don't have RKS and they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: rank skunk They make fun of how tall he is
or his breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Whatever the case may be To throw
poop at the situation and muddy the waters
[SPEAKER_00]: so people won't believe What he's trying
to tell which is basically telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: general public Be wary of this person and
don't give them a shit ton of your money
[SPEAKER_00]: You know because it's probably not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and like like like I said before The
the skunk talk the proof is in the pudding
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is gonna be really aware when
somebody finds skunk Yeah, it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be hard We can you can bring it to you see
you can bring it to one of these big
[SPEAKER_00]: events You can crack the jar you can smoke
it with people and everyone will know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not full of shit Yeah basic and so
until somebody does that you know or until
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets into my hands or skunk vase hands
or somebody that has Real provenance with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut I don't even I mean I would love
for my that original super Scott cut to
[SPEAKER_00]: exist You know if it doesn't exist,
hopefully people find that turp In some
[SPEAKER_00]: other combination of things you know like
even if a total asshole that I dislike
[SPEAKER_00]: Finds it and brings it to meet community
great Yeah, great because at least it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there one of the things that we you know
We should say about the seed business has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been shady and the more you learn
about a lot of seed breeders You have to
[SPEAKER_00]: segregate what you think of them as
personal people from their contribution to
[SPEAKER_00]: the community Yeah, because some of them
are right scumbags right, but they had an
[SPEAKER_00]: undeniable They have an undeniable
Contribution that can't be disparaged sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they might be a narc.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be a cheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be scummy But you know I mean
at the end of the day you contributed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene pool what you did yeah,
and so once you've done that you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: take that away from someone and All of the
all of the old heroes as it were everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: has the ones they like more than others
Yeah, there are almost no honest folk.
[SPEAKER_04]: No not in the not in the old hero sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say Just if anybody if anybody's
out there listening out of the old school
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I would say probably the two most
honest ones are Mel Frank I Think Mel
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank in general what he said and what
he's contributed to and his part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stories or whatever like I don't think we
caught him in any bullshit that I'm aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of I think he's been pretty Upfront about
yeah, what he did and how he contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to things and I also think Jorge Cervantes
Is yeah, he's been helpful is in that same
[SPEAKER_00]: boat and The most important people in the
cannabis community in my opinion You know
[SPEAKER_00]: like and the sort of godfathers of it all
are Neville and Sam skunk man David Watson
[SPEAKER_00]: and and Jim Ortega and You know a few
others and They all have their supporters
[SPEAKER_00]: and detractors sure strongly and There's
valid points of suspicion and weirdness
[SPEAKER_00]: and character issues at times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know yeah, so this leads into Segways
into what we were kind of talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: last night now I Thought it was kind of
interesting that in all the years and in
[SPEAKER_04]: this is including myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one has ever asked VA hey this picture
that is in high times of the chem dog put
[SPEAKER_04]: in high times the first thing is that the
same cut that Came from your crew because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's very distinctive looking right and It
doesn't look like it man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like in according to you
So there's a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy that will remain nameless
that has an old and elf and I'll cut yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right and most people probably Don't know
this but You know Matt and I's little
[SPEAKER_00]: friend crew or whatever We have been in
touch with one of the originators of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole nl crew And we've interviewed and
asked them a bunch of questions and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been invaluable in filling in
some blanks and some history of what was
[SPEAKER_00]: what right and so this kid had this
ancient nl and he was absolutely sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: was what it was and I was like man you
know if you want to send me or One of us
[SPEAKER_00]: you know an eighth or a quarter or
something we'll get it to dude and he can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you exactly Yeah, and he got all mad
and refused mm-hmm, so you know fuck you
[SPEAKER_00]: you're lying Exactly exactly if you don't
if you don't want to get your old famous
[SPEAKER_00]: cut to the person that that bred it You
know and then there's the flip side of
[SPEAKER_04]: that and I've seen this I can't even tell
you countless times when someone hit
[SPEAKER_04]: someone up and They come from the point of
view that appears to be that they are
[SPEAKER_04]: actually trying to do real Historical
research I had this I had this with analog
[SPEAKER_04]: selections the guy who's passing that the
mass super stunk to everyone He came to me
[SPEAKER_04]: was asking about mass super stunk in the
history and whatnot what we found out And
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just being open and honest with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is this is what we know This is
it turning pictures illustrate like we do
[SPEAKER_04]: I Totally fucking got stoned and forgot
what I was talking about And I'll throw
[SPEAKER_00]: this out there, so yeah, here's the thing
so Fucking you know Matt, and I are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do a series of things about history
Hopefully you know and that's really the
[SPEAKER_00]: only reason why I mean I wasn't willing to
show my face for forever But I'm tired of
[SPEAKER_00]: so many people you know the loudest voices
Spewing the most bullshit you know yes
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that needs some pushback because
the younger generation and just history in
[SPEAKER_00]: general Is better served in the long run
it's better served like by the real shit
[SPEAKER_00]: being out there you know and You know and
so I mean you know you're Some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions are gonna be wide-ranging or
shit or whatever, but what's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: is is that people are going to listen to
shit and Then they're gonna use that
[SPEAKER_00]: information to make their bullshit in the
future more believable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was talking about yes That's
that's what you were and there's just no
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking way around that right so yeah like
I'll give you a perfect I'll give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect example Okay, and maybe this
should be saved for the podcast or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but someone before I even knew CSI
Someone who was super close to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it heard the story of how the Mendo
perps happened in detail, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly told that story to CSI Yes,
there was some special details in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he met before we before we actually
met a long-ass time ago And then lost
[SPEAKER_00]: track of each other, but when we
reconnected And I told him my past he was
[SPEAKER_00]: putting me through there I mean obviously
people call him the inspector right so
[SPEAKER_00]: he's putting a ringer And he's asking you
questions and some are true and some are
[SPEAKER_00]: lies, and he's trying to catch you in
bullshit You know yeah, he's amazing at it
[SPEAKER_00]: details that if you were trying to
bullshit you just wouldn't have yeah It's
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're all into a murder mystery Matt
right so yeah, so you know a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: when they put a murder when they when they
report something They print a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are not factual mm-hmm that
way when everybody calls and They tell
[SPEAKER_00]: stories that they have a lead yeah weed
out a bunch of the people that don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth Correct right and otherwise
they'll get hundreds and hundreds of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: leads Yeah, they have to track down and
act like they're real yeah so You know and
[SPEAKER_00]: and so the more history that I that we
spout on some of these subjects You know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a double-edged sword in the future to
like shape up You know I mean there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another guy that like we we won't say you
know his name Just did not give him any
[SPEAKER_00]: fame, but we pushed back against a bunch
of his bullshit And he's claiming to have
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts from two or three years before they
were released to the public ever Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: like they weren't even Created at the time
and he slapped a year out in 95,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like I've got a 93 Yeah,
well if you were there from the era you
[SPEAKER_04]: know they're full of shit, and that's why
pip Invented the term the pre pre and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it got famous Yeah, and so you know and
you know and so all that and so you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean You know that's the you know for a
long time nobody gave a rat's ass About
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these old cuts they just want you
knew they just wanted what was eating And
[SPEAKER_00]: now that this thing has happened and the
game has changed a bit old ancient My
[SPEAKER_00]: uncle my father my secret chemist friend
hiding it and everyone's got these stories
[SPEAKER_00]: of how these long-lost things carefully
passed down to them and Here's the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the story that I remember, but it's
absolutely legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so you know we go we run around
poking holes in these balloons Because
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah many of them have bullshit parts of
the story That simply can't be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Everybody has an unka everybody has a
secret uncle that has the just the bomb
[SPEAKER_00]: diggity and gave it only to them You know
that's right, and you know people do
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever just said this people breed all
the same stuff, so that's a problem is
[SPEAKER_00]: that in my opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've said this bunch And the reason
why is that a bunch of stuff There was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of diversity and if it was good weed
it sold Yeah, meant that an enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of people could grow an enormous
amount of different strains of weed And
[SPEAKER_00]: they would all sell and thus people would
hold on to them and there was a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit Yeah, every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a name craze The the early
2000s purple craze with granddaddy perp
[SPEAKER_00]: great a purple Men for me all that stuff
the sour the kush the cookie The skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like I'm gonna be a breeder right
Everything I have and cross it to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking thing yeah, right So now you've
got you know and I joke about this But if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go back and you look at like European
Kings and Queens Right they all end up
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred Always years they only fucked each
other yeah family in Spain and the family
[SPEAKER_00]: in England and the family in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like They're marrying first
cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're marrying their fucking uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're marrying this and this and this
and so now The amount of things you have
[SPEAKER_00]: that have cookie in it or Kush in it or
this in it There's probably 30 to 50 cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been bred into fucking
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, absolutely everything everything
Popular you know I mean, I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if if archive is still on here
or whatever yeah half exactly You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean, you know Do-si-do becomes
famous and boom do-si-dos and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, boom skittles and everything boom
all these ot cuts are and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and all that and so Basically
over the last 15 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on a massive short-term
bottlenecking project Sure all this
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and so now we're all looking
around and we're like, oh, where's all
[SPEAKER_00]: that diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know because you know, I mean we've
done this whole thing on you know You can
[SPEAKER_00]: hate do-si-do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean to be honest You know I
find the chem dog to be one of my top
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four favorite things and my buddy
And I have some really good buddies that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think highly of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah doesn't work for them very well So,
you know when I if I basically feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's an elite cutting It's because
there's enough heads that like it that
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah enough people that all commonly agree
on it There's always gonna be some heads
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't like it For instance my Staten
Island friend He was a prickly mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a prickly motherfucker, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he's prickly pear and he is not
easy to calm down So he only likes things
[SPEAKER_00]: that calm him down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not gonna be a sativa lover He
probably doesn't think any sativas are
[SPEAKER_00]: elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he doesn't want to get hyped up or
psychedelic or energized or excited You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, he wants to be mellowed out and so
people look for different highs amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: things and You know and there's different
strokes and you know to me an elite is
[SPEAKER_00]: just enough people Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and and you know now there's this
whole thing I always call them midsy
[SPEAKER_00]: elites right where everybody with modern
marketing weed wasn't prepared for modern
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing No, all these companies all
these head stashed all these Kelly
[SPEAKER_00]: companies all these different companies
Everybody has to have the bomb Everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: has to have elite everybody has to pump
their shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to use flowery fucking
language, you know and really to me is
[SPEAKER_00]: like what an elite is is like People were
willing to hold on to that shit during
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, prayed it people were willing to
hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People cared about it people wanted to
like, you know So, you know and even that
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of them got lost Yeah,
so you might not like something but if
[SPEAKER_00]: enough people like I mean for instance,
you know, I don't like most cookie Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but there's enough people out
there that love Cookie and breed with it
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, I might be in the minority
in that regard Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah burn the greatest and it has kind of
a semi blandish high, you know And then my
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is like I like highs Yeah,
people be that gets me high and it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: anything from dog shit to Chem D To dog to
you know, I can deal with racy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can deal with couch lock I can deal with
all that like I just want it to be potent
[SPEAKER_00]: and different and if it's got roller
coaster rides and if it's got Terps and
[SPEAKER_00]: and burns right and that's to me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, you know You know,
I mean that's the most common thing if
[SPEAKER_00]: something comes out that's popular and
then everybody's like Oh that guy sucks or
[SPEAKER_00]: that weed sucks or his weed sucks,
you know Because I don't like him
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically or whatever, you know But
that's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it is if people use your stuff
to breed you're winning Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to say about Neville,
you know There are a bunch of cuts that
[SPEAKER_00]: people still hold on to tightly that come
directly from dude and they're sure I'm 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years old and 20 years old and And they're
still some of the hardest to get most
[SPEAKER_00]: tightly held cuts still it speaks to
itself, you know You know, I basically
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I Don't want to diss people but
I basically feel like if you're breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like three ways to Like know
whether or not you're a good breeder is
[SPEAKER_00]: like can your stuff poppy leets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I would rather I would rather have a
high ceiling Where there's a percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute shit in the line then a high
floor and a low ceiling Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't care if there's a bunch
of junk in the line as long as the line
[SPEAKER_00]: can produce amazing cannabis yeah,
if it just produces a bunch of meds and
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it's too bad and none of it's too
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's particularly
impressive No, it's not personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like and if someone takes your
stuff and they start breeding with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's impressive It means other breeders
want to use your shit Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth carrying on in their lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find value in it Sure, even better
than that if someone wants to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: shit steal it rename it Try to claim it as
theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then they really like your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And maybe they steal it and maybe you
don't get any money for it or maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get any rep for it or whatever Yeah,
what did do is you undeniably improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, that's only
what fucking matters Yeah, cuz at the end
[SPEAKER_04]: of the day a lot of this no one's gonna
remember a lot of this names like Like the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of people that actually know who
Seattle Greg is is fucking tiny Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he's a giant Give it your money
on a people that are remember Neville will
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot Smaller yeah certain on these
things people even super famous people
[SPEAKER_00]: will be forgotten You know, but their weed
lives on they made a contribution to the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They improved it They made it a little
cooler, you know And so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's just one guy's opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just one guy but I mean, you know,
that's kind of how I view it is like I
[SPEAKER_00]: like good pot and essentially what you're
looking for is You're looking for look,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you're looking for elites
You're looking for LeBron James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're looking for the one,
you know Pick a hot supermodel that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: personally attracted to you're looking for
that Yeah, you look for rarity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's not very many people that come
out built like LeBron James that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of athleticism and strength
and height and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Thing with weed it but it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know freaking Neville says he
grew up thousands of nl5 hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah over time And the ones that they're
getting traded now are the ones he
[SPEAKER_04]: selected out of all those Yeah,
so many so many good nl5 hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably a bunch of junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure there's a lot in there You
know, you know, so I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's not easy to find elites,
you know, I mean I Did you know I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam in the 90s and I bought hundreds
of seeds and I found a bunch of junk Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one Yeah Just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah dog, you know, he popped two seeds in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of them became chem sis one of
them became dog Yeah, boom two seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one smaller pop that's
possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know seeds he got dog Boom,
there you go, you know, so sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hunt and hunt and hunt and hunt Yeah,
of course I think That breeding with Ariel
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom or land ray strange is a
promising path to finding elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of work Because there's a
bunch of junk in there and you gotta do
[SPEAKER_00]: that junk like that's the thing is like
all the stuff We're doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, we're building on
what they did 30 or 40 years ago So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in the beginning There's all
these different groups breeding things and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they they made it over to Europe and
Neville and a couple others got to combine
[SPEAKER_00]: them That stuff got sent out to America
and now we're grandchildren and
[SPEAKER_00]: great-grandchildren and
great-great-grandchildren But it's all off
[SPEAKER_00]: the work of others You know and it took
Yeah, I mean Scab, you know Scabby's on
[SPEAKER_00]: here Yeah, you know he goes you go that I
watch his feed He goes through a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas bunch of you know, he gets a bunch
of junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he'll say I'm sure there's a good
amount of junk, but then everyone's You
[SPEAKER_00]: know and that fire makes it worth it to
get all the junk, you know, I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought I bought dozens of nl5 haze seeds
From the era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I never found shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted Yeah, but yeah the Colorado cough
The PIF the Heights haze 88 the Cuban
[SPEAKER_00]: black haze dog shitunk the dog Shit,
but you know, those are just the ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, correct nl5 haze Like there is not
another hybrid out there that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone that I know anyone where there's an
there's that many named elites that still
[SPEAKER_00]: exist Yeah, I don't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't five days literally has
double-digit named elites that have
[SPEAKER_00]: survived both in America and Europe and
Yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only and Kim dogs like the cuts
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Like that's like that's that's
different lines and different pops and
[SPEAKER_00]: different things Yeah, you know five days
was just like literally one line Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good point just one And it was
only it was only there for six years or
[SPEAKER_00]: something before they lost it before they
lost the nl5 cut Okay before we start
[SPEAKER_04]: before we start cutting into our podcast
territory Let's hit it back shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: No Let's head it back to diesel So we
don't cut into our podcast material all
[SPEAKER_00]: right, so so Let me just take this,
you know like for for so everybody hears
[SPEAKER_00]: it So like I mean, I don't know,
you know chem fam is a weird word or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I guess you could call me chem
fam on some level That I got ahold of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts in the 90s and pretty early,
but I was part of the California side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things which was basically me Staten
Island skunk VA and I see collective Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a bunch of the stuff that happened East
that wasn't my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wasn't who I was friends with I
didn't meet or know of those people other
[SPEAKER_00]: than bike stories until way later You know
and so Some of these things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have as old of experience with
sure, you know You know the diesel You
[SPEAKER_00]: know more than most of them as you know,
I have almost no personal experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you know in terms of me actually
growing that some of these things I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: for forever Yeah, and you know some made
their way to me relatively late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yes Abodi and I are friends we don't
see each other that frequently but we We
[SPEAKER_00]: are buddies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes so the reason I wanted to bring up the
diesel was because It's a mate for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where I come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no I I had an mss cut I am
positive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fake early on I have no experience
with mss itself however what I have a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of experience with is the diesel and The
s1s and I've I've been able to go through
[SPEAKER_04]: a shitload of the s1s over the years and
out crosses of the diesel and see what it
[SPEAKER_04]: is and Through finally what I talked about
earlier asking skunk VA Is this mass skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: cut in this high times the same cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: That you and not so we're growing and he
said no and at that moment I realized fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel might not be directly related to
That super stunt cut like I had been
[SPEAKER_04]: assuming all these years This is a planet
carried with me for a long time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know before me Bodhi was carrying it
for a long time and Yeah, so it really
[SPEAKER_04]: changed everything I think I knew about
that planet And I'm not sure and at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point we don't know if if diesel is an s1
of the mass skunk But we and the mass
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk may or may not be s1 hybrid of the
original Super skunk that was popped by
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk VA's mentor So yeah, that's where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough because you know How do I put
this in the most diplomatic way possible
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that you know a lot of a
lot of this history that was being made
[SPEAKER_00]: Was being made by a bunch of young
partiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah young You know ragers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Man, look at that So let me just
respond to that one plant-based ma I have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a I have like so many friend requests
when when 215 ended I I kind of stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: posting a bit because I was angry and I
haven't really posted very much since You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, maybe if you hit me up in the DMS or
something like that after that and request
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll poke you through and you can look at
some of my old posts I mean, I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: super prolific or anything like that,
but there is some cool shit on there But
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's a couple years old at this point
But getting getting back to what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting about is that like let's take
chem dog for a minute, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure Everybody wants chem dog to have all
this amazing information and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics and all this other shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean he was he was 17 years
old or whatever in 91 18 when when he
[SPEAKER_00]: popped the 91 the chem dog and the sis
Yeah Right most of the stuff that was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in his late teens early 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a dad He was partying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was having a good time He was growing
weed in a police state where he could get
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of trouble for getting in trouble
for doing it Yeah, get in trouble at one
[SPEAKER_00]: point, you know Yeah, and so you've got
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a bunch of people and people
don't realize that like You know the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of information That everyone has
there has access to at their fingertips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking incredible Yeah, when I
started growing weed in 1993, I shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: not I bought Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal's
deluxe growers guide and I bought Jorge
[SPEAKER_00]: Cervantes's growers guide and I bought
Robert Connell Clark's Marijuana botany
[SPEAKER_00]: and I knew no one that grew weed and there
was no internet and there was no forums
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was no shit and you were scared
to tell anyone and So information traveled
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly It spread around the way that it
does now super fast, you know people learn
[SPEAKER_00]: things over time and Slow, you know,
and so, you know a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know people's memories differ too,
you know and like Things get famous and
[SPEAKER_00]: then certain people get asked Hey Give me
the play-by-play of what you were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were taking a bunch of acid at 21
years old and chasing Running around doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to know Specifically what
happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you're like, oh, okay So yeah,
so then this happened And then and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: all know like just like getting back to
your true crime thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've determined that one of the worst
forms of evidence ever is eyewitnesses
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely that they've just proven
that people's memories are fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're not the greatest and people
can have you've ever had a business
[SPEAKER_00]: partner you've ever had a You ever had a
grow partner or whatever and you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: not liking each other at the end Have like
very different opinions of how that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: started Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know shit happened and whatever
happened happened, but people can have
[SPEAKER_00]: very different mindsets about what
happened Yeah, absolutely, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so, you know, I mean You know,
maybe that gets saved for the podcast or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever but whenever I whenever I poke
holes in somebody's gig You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not like I'm not trying to chop
anybody down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly historical accuracy Yeah,
no rather than like I think this person Is
[SPEAKER_00]: a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear not so dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said that guy's fucking scumbag,
you know, but you know, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and so we don't know when
diesel was made No, we don't know when the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know How many years between when
the seeds were made and when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: popped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so You know nothing about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we know virtually nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that it was called Greg's deal
Yeah, that's it the diesel and it had some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty orange hairs You know, I mean at
some point like I mean, you know Matt and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tried to figure out an enormous
amount of information about Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically and it comes down to The end
of the day, you know Neville has a story
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam skunk man aka David Watson has a story
They agree on a large variety of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some parts they don't Agree,
and there's not very good like external
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence to like lean one way or the other
Yeah, so diesel's that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we don't know when I mean people say
day wrecker, dude So I mean the head we
[SPEAKER_00]: can talk about that on the podcast or
whatever But the headband the headbands
[SPEAKER_00]: the sours that whole family and how all
that shit works That story is nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a clusterfuck Most even us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah multiple people intimately involved
in the creation of it and being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick their brains at length Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like to figure it out you get a
bunch of info, but there's still parts
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're like, oh fuck, you know,
yeah That's not a that's not easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine and so day wrecker headband Sour
this this this this there's these names
[SPEAKER_00]: that are interchangeable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was same thing with you know,
the 88 haze the Heights haze the pit Cuban
[SPEAKER_00]: black haze all that like Those names get
used interchangeably, but they're the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cut No, and knowing the people that know
enough of the differences to actually say
[SPEAKER_00]: this cut is this and this cut is that is
tiny Yeah, and so so, you know She's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, Jeezel is I mean, it's obviously
super skunk Yes, that's the one thing we
[SPEAKER_04]: know about it for sure is that it has a
heavy super skunk traits You can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you know, and you can tell that
it's super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes No super skunk for people that don't
know is is basically it's a plant called
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan tea, which is This guy named Jim
Ortega and Sam crossed it or Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed it to a very skunky male he had
that he got from Sam's man and Robert
[SPEAKER_00]: Connell Clark and That adding that
afternoon back to the skunk created the
[SPEAKER_00]: rankness Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that rankness Is unmatched,
you know, it really is it really is
[SPEAKER_00]: unmatched and so, you know You know having
grown a bunch of super skunk myself both
[SPEAKER_00]: the famous cut and the seeds Matt,
you know Matt's cut of diesel is
[SPEAKER_00]: Undeniably a super skunk female correct,
you know now does it lean away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rank skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you know buttery Pip Pip described it
best buttery skunk buttery skunk whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so very pleasant so it's in the
family, you know, yeah And obviously it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't breed very easily for scoops for
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't call it them for the murder cut,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God, please The murder cut no He hates
that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hates I don't even use the word hate in
my life generally speaking, but it's true
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's not a good name for a variety
of reasons but you know the and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, the the the super skunk
Rankness might be a recessive thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know You know because obviously it
hasn't been very easy To find and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done a bunch of hybrids, you know,
you've done a bunch of hybrids with Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm, so it hasn't popped correct,
you know and You know, oh, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: foot-in-mouth dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things where like,
you know, like the name of it is It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: even like that the nickname of that
headband is untrue it just got added so
[SPEAKER_00]: much after the fact very late It's almost
a joke now within the last few years that
[SPEAKER_00]: that nickname got added to that headband
cut And I would just greatly prefer that
[SPEAKER_00]: we pick some other nickname besides that
one Like 56 day Sorry about the sinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we call that 56 day really,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know in all honesty, it's not even
it's probably a bit longer than that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never taken a 56 and and it's not
headband either really so So there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of and that that's a whole
bunch of different things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so There's a few headbands that are
renamed cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and there's a variety of reasons
behind why that is The headband we were
[SPEAKER_00]: just talking about there's a really good
reason Related to that name that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like why they renamed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's another headband that you
know fucking got renamed because you know
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shyster in a way But so You know if
people really I mean probably the closest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to the original Super skunk in my
opinion My headband cut that we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: LA Which doesn't always throw super skunk
turps, but at times can yeah and crack a
[SPEAKER_00]: jar and You know and then You know and
then the original sour Yeah, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: original sour at times can be skunky
depending on how you grow it and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're now hot it is When you pull it 707
headband is is not the cut I'm discussing
[SPEAKER_00]: 707 headband is a strain created by
Mandelbrot and He used the the mother of
[SPEAKER_00]: that cut is the cut I was talking And You
know, so People can't see this because I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't post it, but I posted some pictures
of original original sour diesel right
[SPEAKER_00]: next to skunk VA's Super skunk cuts And
you can you can just I mean you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely see the family resemblance
Yeah, yeah, you know the Spears the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they form, you know all that kind of
stuff, you know, it's it's just clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: there So she's not lost An entire under a
different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just got mixed with some different
things and she does exist Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Right now the breeding world
mostly sucks The people that have the real
[SPEAKER_00]: heart are generally speaking doing it in a
garage or other small areas still Rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that and the people that
have a bunch of money and a bunch of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of shit in the legal world and
all the space in the world They're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really using that to do a bunch of real
breeding and isolate things and find it
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to isolate super skunk
from original sour Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should take some it should take some
time, but it would take time in a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: space yeah, and You know real quick since
we're down to the last 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm gonna do Just while me and not
so we're continuing to talk you guys can
[SPEAKER_04]: bid in the chat, but what I'm gonna put up
is a hundred pack of Diesel and a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: pack of sour diesel are up for bid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So place your bids whatever Whoever has it
Near the end we'll call it whatever so
[SPEAKER_04]: place your bids now in here and me and
nots are gonna continue talking I mean the
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing I can say is you know,
you know I'll puff them up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: since he's in here or whatever,
but I've known skunk VA for 20 years right
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is he is not full of shit What he
knows about he knows about you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah And he has been very honest and what
you know, and when he made his and when
[SPEAKER_00]: when he made his podcast You know one of
our mutual buddies and him don't you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we don't see eye-to-eye very
much anymore and so he listened to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: Even he had to say You know, he was
upfront and honest about it, you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: so You know the dog the super skunk the
various, you know cuts and strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know, he's had access to Is a
reliable source on information for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yes very he's a he's a good dude
and he's got love for the plant and Really
[SPEAKER_00]: what I mean, I just told him this the
other day is like really what it boils
[SPEAKER_00]: down to over a long time Is are you good
to people and do you have a love for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah people that have a love for the plant
and a curiosity And a reason for knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to find that out You know,
it just it proves itself over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Yeah, and he's definitely not the
most outspoken of the chem fam in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: history and stuff like that Especially
before his podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he's the he's he's he's reliable
and he's honest about it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so That's cuz he's a punk rocker and
he knows what the fuck's up I mean at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day, dude, there's just you
know Like lying catches up to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does it does and I think a lot of times
when people Especially early on We're
[SPEAKER_04]: renaming relabeling shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was people that were doing it that
didn't understand breeding themselves in
[SPEAKER_04]: the first place So they didn't know that
later down the line people are gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to pop these things and be able to
see these traits and Expressions be like
[SPEAKER_04]: oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, so the naming thing is
tough and maybe I mean, you know It's
[SPEAKER_00]: always hard to figure out like,
you know, Matt and I are we're gonna do a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of Podcast together or whatever And
we're gonna talk about a bunch of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you will find it interesting
or not And yeah, someone talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a variety of subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean as long as interest You know,
we can keep doing them because we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get we want to get this out there So
there's some pushback against the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just You know, I don't have any
skin in the game in the sense that like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making any money off any of this I
don't have seeds to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not coming out With you know,
I have various friends that have tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: push me Matt's one of them into like
Releasing things to the public or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like, you know, I mean maybe
that'll happen in the future or something
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what it boils down is like I is
you know I just I want the truth to be out
[SPEAKER_00]: there for the most part, you know,
and so Maybe I'll use a couple examples
[SPEAKER_00]: real quick with the time we have left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nickname thing It's definitely part
of American culture and it's cool as hell
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get a cool cut they give it a
fucking nickname the nickname sticks it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets passed as that nickname, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean for instance,
you know You know the puck, you know The
[SPEAKER_00]: rumor is is the puck got the nickname the
puck because their buddy used to carry it
[SPEAKER_00]: around in a hockey puck canister Yeah,
like a little bubble tape thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like you'll know the hockey puck
canisters are these like hard black round,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's like They literally have
to hold a hockey puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he would keep his weed in there
And so it got named the puck, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: When it really is a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no You know the the snow for
instance You're in CSI's crew in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You call it Humboldt snow Yes,
you're part of my friend my friend crew
[SPEAKER_00]: that count comes out of like the Eugene
glass blowing crew You called it Eugene
[SPEAKER_04]: snow Yeah, or Oregon snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Oregon snow Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the guy and his girlfriend who I
both know who drove it out from Florida in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida it was called skunk five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Wow, I didn't know that yeah skunk five
Like I literally like I my my kids are
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with the the girl who her and her
boyfriend drove it out She was just down
[SPEAKER_00]: the way from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for forever It was called skunk five
in Florida in the early 90s before they
[SPEAKER_00]: drove it to Utah Wow, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So skunk five, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it shortened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it nl5 skunk one from Neville?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm could be that right be I Know one
is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic five from SSSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that was around a lot Is it
something they bought some hybrid they
[SPEAKER_00]: bought and then it's the five Yeah,
you know Yeah, the fifth pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean the five makes me think that
it's likely an nl It's it's likely an nl5
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one If I had to guess either,
you know, but but that's just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an example of like in Florida
It's one name and in Eugene and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one name Fuckin Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right another another thing that we
could do is, you know Let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Yeah dog shit had one of the coolest
names and fucking cannabis by far by far
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the coolest names an inspired name
supposedly came out of Minnesota
[SPEAKER_00]: Minneapolis era early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be an nl5 Hayes and In
many in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it electric boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct, which is a kill pain right
It gets taken to Oregon somebody renames
[SPEAKER_00]: it dog shit The worst name it didn't even
smell like feces the people that passed it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Oregon So it gets called dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody calls it dog shit Yeah,
almost nobody knows it's called electric
[SPEAKER_00]: boogaloo, but it wasn't electric boogaloo
either And so what this does okay is for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody for everybody that's out there
is it just makes figuring out the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage Of what these things actually are
and what seed companies they came from
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does what he gave Nick Names to
shit Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so once you give nicknames to
stuff Then it's like a very small group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are gonna know what the previous
name was You know, and the only reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that snow was skunk five is because
I literally know the people that drove it
[SPEAKER_00]: out in their car from Florida to Oregon
Yeah Those people are that's just luck of
[SPEAKER_00]: the draw right and so You know You know,
those are just two examples, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think electric boogaloo is an
nl5 haze Starts out as nl5 haze the first
[SPEAKER_00]: crew names it electric boogaloo The second
crew names it dog shit 90% of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have it call it dog shit Yeah,
that's such though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really I'm gonna push back on that I'm
calling that shit electric boogaloo from
[SPEAKER_00]: now on electric boogaloo is a great name
You know, yeah good snow be called skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: five, you know It got called snow because
in in Oregon it was white Yeah frosty
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you know and You know, yeah,
I mean, you know, so that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: happens over and over again and so what
that does is that You know because in
[SPEAKER_00]: America and Canada so many people give
name give nicknames to stuff it obscures
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that The vast majority of it came
from like four or five seed banks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, it does You know and this is
why like I really really and I know you do
[SPEAKER_04]: too Like I push people so hard to learn
the history of the the baselines It's why
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm uploading pictures of all the
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are standing in No, it's not
snow cap is a large yielding Semi midsy
[SPEAKER_00]: afghan that became very popular in Mendo
and other places because it yielded like
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy It is not the Eugene Oregon Humboldt
snow bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly is not You want to see real
snow bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the electric boogaloo exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it Archive has it I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Matt various people have it dog shit
It is it's a it is a killer strain And it
[SPEAKER_00]: really isn't it's really nice pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it still exists Yeah, this guy
loves snow cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can love snow cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally fine I mean, I don't like it
that that much But you know these names
[SPEAKER_00]: get interchanged, you know You know,
I mean sour used to be one cut You know
[SPEAKER_00]: last year, you know, we throw an emerald
cup party every year I brought four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five different sours to the party That I
yeah that was bomb but none of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: the same No, they weren't You know None of
them were the same and so these names
[SPEAKER_00]: Games get changed and changed and changed
I prefer Mendo P to Urkel But me too,
[SPEAKER_04]: huh, but I meet you but um as far as
smoking Because Urkel fucking makes me go
[SPEAKER_00]: in bad places You know Urkel is you know
Urkel's you know Urkel's interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we can talk about that in the in the
pot in the podcast, but I'll say when I
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about earlier in the podcast like I
Am NOT fair family, although I have
[SPEAKER_00]: attended any number of Oregon Country Fair
events I have a bunch of friends who would
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly be considered fair family and
some of my oldest friends Why did I pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the handle not so dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have five minutes left So we're
gonna have to save that for the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: that for the podcast But it's just it's a
play on the dog and it's got kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: silly funny story behind it Yeah,
you know, so I don't know I mean I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: got distracted by that question and now oh
So Urkel, you know, we'll talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: real quick and you know earlier in the
podcast I was talking about on the live I
[SPEAKER_00]: was talking about how every time a name
strain came along that became super
[SPEAKER_00]: popular it crushed what came before Okay,
so in Mendo Mendocino County where I live
[SPEAKER_00]: in Northern, California There was so much
demand for purple for a number of years
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone grew it and no matter how
much of it You grew it moved, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm literally talking there are
thousands of growers up here that grew
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel Then sour becomes popular kush
cookie skittles this that everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like six motherfuckers that have
Urkel Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just all of a sudden died everywhere it
you know I mean, you know if there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're lucky that CSI saved it and
loves it and decided to breed it into all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can't be lost Exactly, we went in 15
years from literally thousands of people
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt and Mendocino County having it
to almost no one in either of those
[SPEAKER_04]: counties having it It was being sold as a
clone in almost every collective as a and
[SPEAKER_04]: the legit cut was being sold in almost
every clone Fast forward 10 or 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: and nobody cares about it because you
know, it's not marketable currently and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah 9% of people that had it drop it and
they grab something that's more marketable
[SPEAKER_04]: Breeders syndicate the podcast it's
available on iTunes Spotify sound I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know and it's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had I had some life issues I was
supposed to record it with Matt a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some stuff come up it became You
know problematic for me To do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're gonna keep doing it You know a
lot of you guys probably know Fletcher
[SPEAKER_00]: from archive and CSI You know Matt and
myself all that we're all good friends
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all planning on doing various
historical podcasts and in various ways
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes and forms To try to get as much of
that history out there as we can that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know about you know and And have people be
able to hear it, you know, yeah from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone That's not trying to sell you
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, and it's hard for people to
research You know, even even the forums a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of the forms are gone you can't find a
lot of that info that was up there once
[SPEAKER_04]: and It'll be a cool place to have a
resource for people in strain If you know
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly what you're looking for and you
already know how to weed through bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you don't know how to weed
through bullshit it boy, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get a lot of bad info Okay,
I'm gonna give a call last minute on the
[SPEAKER_04]: option.
