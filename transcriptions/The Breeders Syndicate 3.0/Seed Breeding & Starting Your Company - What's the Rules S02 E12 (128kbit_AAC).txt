[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: What up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting this ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waking up for my beauty rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I so desperately need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to do your hair and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do my hair, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting their NL seeds,
finally, from the shipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, I figured we could talk
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I made a post earlier this week
about certain Breeder etiquettes and try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get an idea for where people's minds
are at in our community currently,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mean, back in the day,
there are always a lot of rules,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everybody kind of knew the rules,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't, you'd find out real
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, several people would be there to
correct you if you broke said rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little different now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, things are acceptable
now that weren't once acceptable at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured we could go over the old
school rules of breeding and how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: changed over the years a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think some of it, too,
is just I think whatever like the norms
[SPEAKER_00]: are in whatever subculture that you come
up in at the time, you accept those as
[SPEAKER_00]: like the way they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a small enough subculture,
like the older people in that subculture
[SPEAKER_00]: will enforce it, like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let you know when you're out of line
about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there becomes a situation
where, you know, as times change,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I've said it before,
but we we'd sort of reinvents itself every
[SPEAKER_00]: five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scene changes, not just with seeds,
obviously, but like the whole like what
[SPEAKER_00]: drives what should be the whole shebang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's almost like people have to
learn it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what parts of it survive in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most common question I'm asked
when I do the live solo is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, is this allowed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think generally speaking, most people
don't want to step on toes, but not
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not a common sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it isn't common sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some degree, it's like it's kind of
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, you know, it's kind of like,
you know, putting the putting the shopping
[SPEAKER_00]: cart back in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no you don't get in trouble if you
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no there's no enforcement
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the right thing to do and it
might make that teenage kids job easier
[SPEAKER_00]: going out there and pushing carts or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can like leave it wherever the
fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what happens in weed,
too, is because there is no enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black market, you know, or the
traditional market or whatever you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's in various states and
various conditions and various places,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is not really an enforcement
mechanism now other than public shame,
[SPEAKER_00]: which only works on some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be more effective, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some people that they don't
feel guilt or shame either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to work on them any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's there's an aspect to it
where I, you know, Matt can talk a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: about about this stuff because there's
definitely a lot of etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, maybe just at the start is
like we are sort of like a small
[SPEAKER_00]: subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're growing and we're growing,
you know, and, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: subcultures kind of were all very like
very evident on like where you grew up
[SPEAKER_00]: even before like the Internet and
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, once the forum came
about, which, you know, there was a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of rules that were established on how to
communicate with one another and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: act with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like if it was self-policing in the
way Matt said, because if someone started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something super silly, a bunch of
DMS would start shooting around between
[SPEAKER_00]: the powers that be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the culture would sort of
self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person would be called out either
privately or publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there would be various things
that would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, it it would happen very
quickly, too, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I think it's important
to say, too, is that back then there was
[SPEAKER_00]: more like a gate gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how would you say gatekeepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where like you really couldn't you
couldn't buy cuts back then, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to like gain people's trust and
you had to trade and getting seeds and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to do all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you got ostracized by something
or the word spread around that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: unreliable, like it made your life a lot
harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to get good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to get cuts when you fuck people
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just saw Arkive talking about
localized culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get this is not about breeding,
but I'll do like a quick aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in Chicago, where I grew up,
good weed was really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically, like when you smoked a
bong, like you would only smoke part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would turn it and you would
pass it to your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like really rude to like burn
the whole top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make it all black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each person would try to like carefully
only as much as as much as they needed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would rotate that kind but around
and everyone would take three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: hits, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get out to California like I did
in the late 90s on the culture out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't share bong hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took like little snappers and that was
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody turned it where I like I kept like
taking a partial hit and like handing the
[SPEAKER_00]: bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody nobody did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody did the same thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even when I first moved here,
people didn't use the word dank to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe weed right around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought when I called it dank that
it was like musty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was accusing them of hearing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't need to go into all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I just mean in the sense there was
these localized things that were normal in
[SPEAKER_00]: your group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forums and the Internet and all that
was like what Arkive was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's sort of like nationalized
that a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also makes it like not in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which I think is like now it's
very impersonal now, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought one of the things that's
interesting is when Matt and I were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about this subject, I sort of
asked a number of our good friends like
[SPEAKER_00]: how many people that are breeding now do
you think started within the last five to
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer came back 95 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is that there's just
this, you know, tsunami of new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how can the five percent that was
doing it before or whatever, like how can
[SPEAKER_00]: they train the 95?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get on etiquette and like what's
normal and what's acceptable and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and what's honorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tsunami of fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was just reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, maybe if you maybe you want it,
maybe you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to not focus on that because I can't
like read if it's really fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe you should talk about like some
of the etiquette on the forums when you
[SPEAKER_00]: first started getting involved with
breeding and trading and what those norms
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like back in the farm days,
I mean, it was always obvious to me that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's a natural thing for
people when you first get into something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You first get into a subculture,
you look for to do the community Jen's
[SPEAKER_01]: generally looks to to find direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who do people in the community
trust?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are the the people at the head of the
community that when they write,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody responds or pays attention to or
finds finds truth in what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually the first step to the
forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are really quick that
it was a lot better to and I ran into this
[SPEAKER_01]: one really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot better to listen and learn than
to just start talking and think,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what you're fucking talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that was my biggest step.
[SPEAKER_01]: One brick wall was you learn really quick
that you don't know what the fuck you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about when you when you start
getting around people who have been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what the forum offered.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of dudes that were,
you know, been doing it fucking four years
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point, you know, didn't
necessarily mean they were doing it right
[SPEAKER_01]: for those 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they at least had that experience in
the community lasting that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were the ones writing the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we all looked up to from a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, going on the on Overgrow,
going going on the Breeders Forum and
[SPEAKER_00]: reading arguments, going back and forth
between Sam Skunkman and Chimera and some
[SPEAKER_00]: different people that were on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely knew in my early 20s that
like, boy, these people know a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: than I do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone was arguing different
opinions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it was a start,
at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a start to see who is who is
kind of knew their shit and breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, because a lot of people, you know,
there there were there weren't as many
[SPEAKER_01]: people making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know people that have like jumped to
jumped into this in the past five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be kind of hard to understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like at one point, there was,
you know, maybe 50 people worldwide that
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing it to any.
[SPEAKER_01]: To any degree, that's worth noting,
you know, like there were always people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, making random Paul and Chuck's
in their tents, trying to sell it through
[SPEAKER_01]: DMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people that were actually selling it
in the marketplace, there was about 50,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's that wasn't that long
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's way different now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the options that you have are
abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to tell who knows what,
when, where, while, what, how.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, all of it, you can't tell
who knows who.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forums aren't as abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not a really popular medium
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is obviously the way of the
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, yeah, anybody can have a big
podium now and bark loud enough to make
[SPEAKER_01]: you think they know this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There used to be a much better process for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was again, back then, it was a
quick way to be able to fucking blacklist
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are stupid, you can blacklist
them from the community pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one thing that I think that is
pretty massive that has changed a bunch is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, other than like Holland
and Canada and maybe a few select people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there really wasn't money in seeds
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people trading seeds tended to be
breeders or tended to be enthusiasts or
[SPEAKER_00]: different people that wanted to mess with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it wasn't it wasn't very easy to
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like a marketplace with DMS and
stuff like that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like you had to gain people's
trust to get seeds or cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there was sort of like a
little bit more of like a slower vetting
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think today, you know,
people have people have monetized it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where it's like that's that's
the era that most of these people have
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can get your work out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like IG came along at the
perfect time to really explode people's
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to get in touch with other people
and even offer up seeds for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you're, you know,
like even just figuring out how to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to the public was sketchy when you
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, on the forums, too, like there was
pretty strict rules about selling seeds on
[SPEAKER_01]: most of these forum sites through DMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all kind of knew like especially
those of us who who ran forums,
[SPEAKER_01]: ran some of the forums and admin them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all kind of knew that everybody had an
ability to see those DMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times people would get shut
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for selling seeds and DMS on
these sites because they didn't want the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal recourse that could come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was also an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because information exchange is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start exchanging money and
illegal things, then it's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking is typing and talking is different
than sending and exchanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we should say, too,
that like the you know, the first two big
[SPEAKER_00]: forums that really connected people were
Overgrow and Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got shut down when a Canadian
seed bank that was tied into both of them
[SPEAKER_00]: got raided.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they they combined, you know,
you know, economic seed activity with
[SPEAKER_00]: people talking shit on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a big epic fail for the
forums was when Heaven's Stairway went
[SPEAKER_01]: down with Richard Calrissian and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a really good
history episode to do one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on that, we could talk the whole
thing on just that subject, because
[SPEAKER_00]: Heaven's Stairway was like a big seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heaven's Stairway was one of the was a
Canadian seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were selling a lot of seeds in
America and they were tied into the first
[SPEAKER_00]: two big forums where everyone gathered,
which was Overgrow and Cannabis World
[SPEAKER_00]: starting in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in about I can't remember when it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was was it oh for something like that
or five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Fletcher will say he knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scared, actually, a lot of people
back into being quiet for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really messed around with the,
you know, international can of graphic or
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the later ones, because I was so
sketched out about what Matt had said
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, archive said oh five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, four or five, something like that,
because, you know, nobody knew our cops
[SPEAKER_00]: reading your DMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, do they have my IP
address?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was sketchy enough back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's an aspect there
where it was like the reason why we bring
[SPEAKER_00]: all that up per the subject is it really
wasn't easy to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really wasn't easy even to build a
marketplace or to build a fan base to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to like the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about like most of the
breeding that I did, it was all way pre
[SPEAKER_00]: this era.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we didn't even if, you know,
the only people we knew who to sell seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: to are our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really like unless you wanted
to like basically give your lines away
[SPEAKER_00]: like DJ Short did to fucking Canada or
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only way you could sell your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to basically partner with one of
those groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the seed, the seed, the seed banks
hadn't opened up at that point to to
[SPEAKER_01]: England where it were the British and the
European seed banks came in super heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hadn't quite opened up quite yet when
that had happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was so basically, you know,
there wasn't that many seed breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: because there wasn't that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really a way to monetize it
very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that left it to people that were
interested in it, you know, and cared
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that the way that it's
exploded now with IG and especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: reversals and not needing males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of people just started
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think there are any rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's where a lot of these
battles come from that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you've seen Matt get into a time or
two, maybe once or twice because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's trying, you know,
because people he's trying to like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some generally accepted norm that's
getting stomped on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he mentions it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be what he might be talking
about, like all the old timers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: around totally agree with that viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that that is the way you should
conduct yourself on all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the new people are like,
who is this fucking idiot?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, piss off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here's I mean, here's a different
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the forum days, if somebody would
have put up a clone list with with prices
[SPEAKER_00]: next to each clone on how much you could
buy them from, nobody would send that
[SPEAKER_00]: person cuts ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that would be fucking done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would it would be like in a meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not that some people wouldn't buy
them off them because people have always
[SPEAKER_00]: been desperate for access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that person couldn't trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the last time that person
ever got those clothes to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just was like it was so unheard
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one even tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now and I'm not even saying it's
wrong, but I'm just saying like now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can advertise like, hey, I've got a
clone collection and every 10 days I can
[SPEAKER_00]: take cuts off these moms and this is how
much they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we came up, it wasn't normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was not how you got things.
[SPEAKER_00]: No whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't monetized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were talking generally speaking
here because, yes, people could sell their
[SPEAKER_01]: own cuts of shit and like nobody would get
upset about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about like things like
you would never see Chem 91 on a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: list.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would never see Chem D on a fucking
list for sale because if you got that cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: you knew the rules with those cuts and you
knew that they weren't supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're the first one person to
fucking do that, you're going to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: world of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think the person who's responsible
for passing Chem 91 over there still has
[SPEAKER_01]: that around their neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, even like even with seeds,
it was like you couldn't you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: take, you know, like you couldn't take
like someone like DJ's work of blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: and cross it to a bunch of things and then
start just marketing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, only assholes would ever do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people did that,
but it was like because because they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't make Blue Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they didn't make a bunch of the blue
hybrids that were sweeping around in that
[SPEAKER_00]: forum era.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was honestly mostly people doing
it for themselves and trading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you going to stop like free
exchange of people hobbyists making beans
[SPEAKER_00]: and exchanging?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some degree, they were right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to some degree, the shorts or the short
DJ did try to stop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was talks of contracts
that he felt like people signed when they
[SPEAKER_01]: bought seeds and they weren't allowed to,
you know, make hybrids using the word
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry or anything of the sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and this is frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed breeders from Neville on from the 80s
on, which is like, what do you do when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start selling seeds and then someone takes
your stuff and uses it and does whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they want with it and steals your lineage
and information and doesn't give you shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you let it out, there is no once you
let it out, once you share it,
[SPEAKER_00]: once whatever, there is no proprietary
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an honor code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it takes is somebody who's who's
got more financial wherewithal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in honor, you know, there's a lot of
stories about how one cutter, this cut
[SPEAKER_00]: slipped out of a pretty small circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that used to have seeds,
it's like you kind of had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Matt, maybe you should talk about
the fact that, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day, if you wanted to work
with somebody's known clone or something
[SPEAKER_00]: they were responsible for, a lot of old
seed breeders would give that person a big
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of those seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you would cut down for using the
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had arrangements with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still do that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some of us still do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if we use someone's cut,
they're always going to get seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's another norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was normal then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super normal now, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And per archives point, I 100 percent
agree just with what's going on in chat,
[SPEAKER_01]: like someone mentioned, you know,
copycat does the S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't even go as far as making the S
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just puts seeds in a bag and people
grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of times they have,
you know, more males than females and they
[SPEAKER_01]: still don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not some people just still kind of
hope that they're getting what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: paying for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't always happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that would have been shook
out so fast in the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, these are different days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, because so many people have
joined now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a wake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that it's like there's a few like
older people trying to like establish
[SPEAKER_00]: norms and decency and stuff like that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even respect to people and some
people, you know, humans are humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always abused it on different sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't I honestly don't think
DJ has a right to all that blue stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: since he's been selling it for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see someone put out some S ones
of some of the blue clones, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but, you know, there's an aspect to
it where, you know, we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because IG and these other forums allowed
aspects of people to monetize breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: way more people got into breeding than it
was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wonder as like as like the
market shifts and people's desire for
[SPEAKER_00]: different seed shift, like how many people
will stick it out when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think a lot of people think
it's easy and fast and it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to like it's easier to make a
bunch of seeds than it is to grow a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of fireweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to throw up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to rush him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing that lick thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's there's an aspect to
that where it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it it's the reason why so few people bred
back in the day was mostly because there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't any profit in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to do it because you wanted to
make better wheat or you wanted to trade
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds with your friends or you had
some other friends and you were trading
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was fairly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, to some degree,
like so much modern stuff is based on like
[SPEAKER_00]: the farther you go back, it gets into a
narrower, narrower pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's only so many people
messing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, like it's the
same thing with cuts, how they go from
[SPEAKER_00]: like super common to super rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the finances get pulled out
from under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, only four people have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like we saw the earth or grain crack
or any number of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I mean, you know, I,
you know, when I was talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Superdog project or whatever, my my buddy
who I did it with, he was actually like
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of his time and he was like,
dude, we could take this whole eight
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about how many seeds that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made an enormous amount of seeds,
but like there was nowhere for them to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000 and 2001 or two, three,
three, there was nowhere for him to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I traded them to other people and I
gave them out to a bunch of friends all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like, you know, we had tens of
thousands of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like today where I can come up
with 50 different names and make some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and get a hold of thousands of
people that might like my shit and find a
[SPEAKER_00]: home for all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have direct marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To to buyers right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like, unless I wanted to go on
like, when did even like Breed Bay and
[SPEAKER_00]: like those little auction places start
2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breathe is probably 2007 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was just talking about was like
four or five years before even like the
[SPEAKER_00]: first online sort of like little breeders
could pop on there and try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, you know, yeah,
it was it was still kind of sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to walk him out real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody claims to have I'll answer some
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody claims to have archives sour
because archive is a collector and has a
[SPEAKER_00]: good sour and people want to tie sour to
some legitimate name, just like the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people want to tie cuts to like,
oh, it's this legit cut from this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's kind of why that's
kind of why I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut etiquette really has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed etiquette has changed like how I
mean, when we bred back there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was only males, so it took some
effort, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the STS thing and the reversals thing and
all that is really like you didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: need to keep males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't really need to do anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to take two elite cuts and
and try to see if you can get some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that IG kind of revolutionized
things a bit, maybe for the better in some
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, but maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely revolutionized things and it
made people be able to get into markets
[SPEAKER_01]: they normally wouldn't have been able to
get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a lot of people would be for the
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about where it's going to end
up for cannabis as a whole, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe I should maybe I should
say this and I'm not going to I won't name
[SPEAKER_00]: names because I'm not big on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I should say is that when me and
friends of mine like Matt or CSI or
[SPEAKER_00]: different people chat that know about
breeding, the gulf between what most
[SPEAKER_00]: people think their breeders are up to and
what those breeders are actually up to is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are people out there doing
real work, growing out their own seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: making selections, you know, keeping
females for future use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, a lot of these
newest seed companies do very little of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very much make the cross,
package the cross, market the cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: make the next cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're more like one off crosses than
they are doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, when I talk about breeding,
I'm not even I'm not even trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: who's a real breeder or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, breeding is like I
think in its most understood concept is
[SPEAKER_00]: your breeding towards a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're crossing two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hoping to find things you like
about both in the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you're happy as hell or you start
doing more work because you want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: it in some direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's with all breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're messing around until you
get to where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these days, back in the day,
most people had some kind of goal of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were breeding plants for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now I think it's more like,
well, I'm going to take skittles and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take gelato and it's probably
going to throw some color and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: probably have good turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the market wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to mash it together if they
even think that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it's just name to name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and since and since,
you know, I mean, we could we could talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about widow, I suppose, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, widow was one of those
things that that came out and got cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Widow males especially got cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking about blueberry blue
widow was one of my favorites because it
[SPEAKER_00]: had turps from the blue and it had frost
and density from the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty amazing in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the these things have their
time in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety five percent or so breeders have
gotten involved in the last five or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they're breeding with what's
easily accessible to them at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's breeders like CSI or
Archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Matt or various friends of ours that
have collections that date back quite far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they make lots of different mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of modern seed breeding right
now is some combination of cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG skittles, cookies, Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's the same 15 to 35 cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blend it every which way, because that's
what they had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are trying to make
variations on an already popular theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sell their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people find good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is real gems in Neville's
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think Neville would have a hard time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of junk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have a real hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a lot of junk in the
in that 90s weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I bought like probably seven or
eight packs of NL five Hayes in that like
[SPEAKER_00]: 94, 95 era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't find anything that I liked
that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then other people have keepers that
are from that era still today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of how seeds work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's like now we've got this thing
where like everybody needs to have like
[SPEAKER_00]: high floor seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your seeds need to be attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people get so angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the one thing that people
hold breeders to the fire for is her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders get a pass on everything else but
bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's one thing nobody gets a pass
on anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets attacked viciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not not even for like is the weed good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was nanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I think now it's like you
can breed and you can go buy some cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can trade with some cuts and you can
get these different things and reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no and you make packaging and
call it names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people put more effort into
the name sometimes than they do into like
[SPEAKER_00]: what the breeding is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was having a discussion with
bitters the other day about there's a cut
[SPEAKER_01]: called the soul assassin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there were three cuts,
the soul assassin, one, two and three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're old cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not the oldest, but they were
considered, you know, like in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: decade of being around as some of the
first ones well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they never got popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of it was because of the
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept telling everyone in our crew
like, hey, this is the shit growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, this shit is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody was just kind of like,
you know, because it didn't even to us,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are that realize, you know,
names are nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still because it didn't have a catchy
name for an OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't catch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he messaged me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, bro, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, bring it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, why doesn't why didn't this
catch on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't I get this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, because the fucking name,
because the name name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so there's I could talk about a
couple of things real quick on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this cut up here called Big
Wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Bud train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the classic way to name a
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smash half the name from each
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big wreck, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finishes in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody fucking wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the these guys I know are out there and
Mendo and Kovalo and they're looking at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can't believe how beautiful it
is, but nobody wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Big Wreck isn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they decide to name it the Barry
White.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that is that the first iteration of
Barry White?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Barry Wright is Big Wreck when it was
named Big Wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking it's nobody wanted it when it was
named the Barry Barry White.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Barry White.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flew like hotcakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, they're getting a
premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a buck or two more than
other people because they have the Barry
[SPEAKER_00]: White.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just all based on Big Wreck was a shitty
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted Big Wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Barry White, everybody wanted Barry
White.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll answer this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of people right after I
talked about Nanner's back and forth thing
[SPEAKER_00]: about about herms and it should be bred
out or this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll just say that like the reason
why everyone has sour is Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cut had crazy Nanner's all over
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush was Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Trinity is Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of amazing weed that we have
right now that wouldn't be here if that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant they were working with didn't have
Nanner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really humbling as a breeder to
have some accidents in somebody's four
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter in the 90s outpace anything you've
ever tried to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you know, some 19 year old
kid makes an accident and those beans are
[SPEAKER_00]: like white hot fire and still hold the
test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're out there like trying to plan
shit and doing pops and Punnett squares
[SPEAKER_00]: and various bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as good as that accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that accident that that is one
accident that takes precedence over a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people's most famous cookies
is a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies is a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: is a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour is a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all came from her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful before you want to breed out
all these herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are herms a problem when it comes to
seedless and and sales and all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I used to grow this book,
so many people dropped that old super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk that everyone's hunting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it hermed like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you got eight lights
of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I'm not saying that herms
aren't an issue, but I'm also saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not a total negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the weed that the sour came
out of that room lightly hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found a few phenols that became
sour, you know, the you know, the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: was some lightly seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or so we think that we think, yeah,
you know, the cookies was definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Trinity was seeded weed that came out
of a sack of weed that the grower grew in
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of cases of that, you know,
and so that that level of that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant selfing or plant crossing really is
kind of the bedrock of what we got.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and no, herm seeds don't
necessarily produce herm plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think sour, sour sounds like as
far as we can determine, sour was a
[SPEAKER_00]: multistage herm accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think so was cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie was, you know, maybe three or four
over a course of a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're we're barely just being able
to get the general consensus in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community to understand that not
all fem seeds herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're we're we're trying to work on
that with the public's take on what what
[SPEAKER_01]: is intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're in the Stone Ages when it comes
to that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this is this is a norm we
should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the norm was up until about 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way you bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bred the way God intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all this breeding knowledge and
work and it's all based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people started spreading these
tales of sex reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not received warmly in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people like Rascal or Matt or various
others, Matt can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of scorned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cheating, making fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a cheater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruining, ruining the gene pool for good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure he's heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he heard it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did you hear?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was kind of like people even
accepting that reversals were an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable way to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other big one was it's just
cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the easiest way to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just reading herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows that making fem seeds is
fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be as vigorous as a
male and a female breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to they're going to genetic
drift within a few cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be a sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic drift of the do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big deal where it was like,
oh, fem seeds, fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be as strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to hold up over years
like the wound is DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, DNA DNA for future generations to
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things were like, like typed
into the forums like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody just asked if if can OG and sour,
if breeding with those is weakening the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like we've had enough time to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, you know, people can overdo
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as Kim, OG and sour,
I think they tend to be some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's a plant survival
trait that it has in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it's evolutionary there
because it was very useful to the survival
[SPEAKER_00]: of the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I mean, that's evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's like everybody does fem
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some like CSI and I joke about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still some lingering like,
oh, you're a bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fem reversal guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's almost like a running joke
now, but it's still exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a fem guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing real work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a norm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a hack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, like, really, I think one of
the things that changed it, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, since there was only a few
people doing it and the crosses they were
[SPEAKER_00]: making, like rascal stuff was so fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you say this weed sucks when it
doesn't suck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I genuinely think rascal
might have been the one who really flipped
[SPEAKER_01]: it on its head where he was putting out
stuff that was so nice, like white fire
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of the Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi crosses
and some of the white crosses in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: White oracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was it was just like, OK,
now this is so fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we not going to go to this shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he really started changing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a nice stable of Afghans that he
crossed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and there was a lot of fire that came
out of those first things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like, all of a sudden,
people are like, oh, my God, Wi-Fi by
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then how does it suck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pretty well proved the point that
things weren't being weakened and that it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't all herm shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start going and then you
start going and you start studying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, other plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a technique that's used all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In normal agriculture, reversals,
selfing is is a it's more common than
[SPEAKER_01]: regular breeding in many cases because it
gets you to uniformity, which is ideal in
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But talking about norms, I mean,
you can't really blame, but you could say
[SPEAKER_00]: like you could blame Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Rob Clark wrote this Bible that I
still recommend today on breeding and laid
[SPEAKER_00]: out how you're supposed to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt and Rascal's shitty way of
reversing plants like that, that wasn't in
[SPEAKER_00]: the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not why that's it's not in the
Bible, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing some out of Bible shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some like you've got some like some
weird shit you've got going on under
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it just wasn't the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but now it's now it's the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I noticed over time,
too, that a lot of people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading the rumors that are profligating
the rumors that, you know, all FEMC term
[SPEAKER_01]: all this, it usually tended to come from
the creators of regular seeds from these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 99 percent of the time we'd all catch
them you know, doing a project,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they fail at reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden, fuck those
fucking things, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't it wasn't what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a cheap, quick route to making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ponds less viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's failure involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have failure with regular seeds
very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not things run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember having a failed seed
run when I used mails from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't think of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of a single time I didn't
get a bountiful amount of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes, you know, we have
friends that do reversals and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even get enough seeds for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it doesn't fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, our I mean, I remember our
buddy Pipp tried to reverse his sour cut
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think he got like 18 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it was literally like you
got a small handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and you know, like even with the
spray, I tell people like everything
[SPEAKER_01]: reverses, not everything drops pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, we can reverse your plant that
reversing the plant is the easy part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting it to produce viable pollen is not
the easy part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know your plant very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's luck of the draw on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that's interesting that we
should throw in there is when the reversal
[SPEAKER_00]: tech came around, a few breeders like our
our buddy Shaw and a couple other people,
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually started reversing males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to get some turps and to try to
see what was like what the what the male
[SPEAKER_00]: would look like as a female to inform what
breeding they would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how effective it was,
but they were something they were they
[SPEAKER_00]: were curious about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first ran into that on ICMAG forums and
it was Sam the Skunk Man and someone else
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was so fascinating and I went
to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started using that method for the
males that I would select to see what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of turps they might have, even though it
doesn't necessarily mean that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pass them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get an idea for, OK, I'm seeing
this in my in my crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know it's coming from the male side,
not something hidden back in the female
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that aspect from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember on those forums Sam Skunk
Man saying that all seeds made from males,
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse males were unviable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never tried it out of all the male
reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't try it because I just
assumed he was preaching gospel like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turned out not to be the case,
not to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it makes regular seeds when you
do male reversal runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was just it was just another
technique for people to try to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a hint of what the male might do
without going through all of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I have to cross it to something and
then grow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I mean, yeah,
basically like act like the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have come in recently and then
how people get access to seeds and how
[SPEAKER_00]: people get access to cuts and stuff has
totally changed the norms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a lot of people I think it's
going to change soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of people jumped in
because for the last five or six or seven
[SPEAKER_00]: years, it looked like a pretty easy way to
make some money and do some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to get a lot
harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most of the people maybe maybe
the charitable way to put it is they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really know the work required and
the more work you put in, the less money
[SPEAKER_00]: you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely plenty of people out
there that are just trying to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: their return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and they and this has almost flipped
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is something that me and
other British talk about all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the longest time, we were all expected
to test your seeds because you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's in your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're serious about it, you'd like to
know what happened in the cross that you
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd like to see it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost gone in this market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost gone because things move so
fast and because when you say when you
[SPEAKER_01]: show your work that you're doing
something, it's going to take,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, X amount of months to a year and
a half till it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you show that work before it's done,
you can guarantee someone's going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: they did it just recently better and they
have it for sale right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so the whole testing aspect is
kind of getting phased out because one,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not rewarded in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people won't pay more for seeds
that are tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's not happening to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not the norm anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to be the one testing,
you're the one losing money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be late to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's funny when Matt and I were
collecting like 90s seed catalogs and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like some of those, they would go
three or four years and only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the whole catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they would just offer lines and that
was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a situation where,
you know, people essentially make one
[SPEAKER_00]: offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have lines they're
repeatedly making.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make one offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have X amount of seeds of it and they
have it until it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'll call out one thing just
because it's super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the candy rain fiasco.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing where you have to test and
you have to grow up a room of your own
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds like you see our buddy CSI do all
the time or archive or somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they're growing out a room of of
their work and they show you a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a simpler test you can do,
which doesn't tell you nearly as much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly prevents problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what we call a germ test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you take 50 or 100 seeds and you
attempt to germinate them and you make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that they're healthy and there's no
issues and they pop right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the most basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most basic shit you could ever
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't even do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so occasionally people get burned
where they offer up a selection like candy
[SPEAKER_00]: rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the only time it's happened,
but no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden people get their seeds
don't pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die and they just didn't even do a
germ test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those times people will come on IG
and they'll be like they'll open up a wet
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel and you'll just see like tails
of of, you know, of fresh roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This long.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes two or three, four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make sure there's not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most basic things you can
get to not piss your customers off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, most people just want to
get it to market and maybe somebody didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even teach them that a germ test was
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they even had a clue,
you know, and maybe so maybe it's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: malicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just one of those norms like we
were talking about where like we know
[SPEAKER_00]: these there's these various steps that you
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make sure that they're viable and
people don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why bother?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, you know, every once
in a while, if you don't test your stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to put out something that
that's funky, really funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll backfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all eventually backfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we reinvents itself every five
or 10 years, are people even going to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they already forgot the candy rain
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even forgot the candy rain thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just sticks out because it
was one of those things where you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay like eight or nine hundred dollars a
pack and there was so much better to pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was so much build up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even still, five hundred a pack is 50
bucks a seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's insane to have it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine you pay 50 bucks a seat and
then seven of them don't don't pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was a big hubbub about them
not sending replacements and then
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think most people ever got the
replacements on them either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet they're still around, still
operating like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, never would have flown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have been kicked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community blacklisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I can only think of one
person in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years that's been blacklisted and it's
finally coming down was Rez.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was legit blacklisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't say his name without people
jumping all over you on the forums at one
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nowadays he's got fans again,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, America likes a redemption
story and it's been reinvented long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't even know that,
like, despite despite all those
[SPEAKER_00]: shenanigans that we won't talk about,
like on the forums, Rez was a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, even before then, you know,
even before the nasty shit that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: before that, he was kind of a jerk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's there's a part of it
where it's like, you know, like you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be like that, like, you know,
famous like Simpson's thing where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like old man yells at cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, but there's an aspect
where it's like in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to have a community,
communities have norms and rules and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that like people generally abide by to be
polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cannabis, if you don't talk about
that kind of stuff, how would you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really why we wanted to kind of
to chat about it back and forth about
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of it, because there's
so many new people that like if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people listening like to what the norms
would be, you know, people get into
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments about this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they're voluntary norms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're voluntary norms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people are just like, fuck you and
fuck your norm, you know, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joint breath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tricked Peabod.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he turned around and just
started selling chem cuts because he knew
[SPEAKER_00]: he could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And told everybody and told everybody to
eat a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm making three to five hundred a pop
and there's people that want them that
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get them and I'm going to be the
bridge that gets them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, it it's one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with breeding, it's it it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, like breeding is like intention and
there's a lot of failure in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have these crazy expectations
of like what their breeders are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their germ testing and their and
their phenol hunting and they're testing
[SPEAKER_00]: their own stuff and they're making sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we know people that do that,
but then it's like you have to sell seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like a year or two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it takes you that long to figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, another another big change is
the name game in the past several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, like back in the day, we all had
to do due diligence of making sure when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're choosing names, you better fucking
went and searched online to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody else used that fucking name or
you're going to have some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even I took it super seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's not a place at one point,
like where people took our name,
[SPEAKER_01]: we like, yo, bro, we put time,
energy, you know, fucking testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing into that name and you just are
branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's our brand with our branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no legal recourse and nobody
most of us don't give a fuck about legal
[SPEAKER_01]: recourse, even if there was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more like, you know, you're you're
stepping on toes, you know, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: lock you out of this X, Y, Z if you fuck
with us like that, it's Nowadays,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten to the point of where I don't
even really Google names anymore because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many fucking companies with so
many fucking names that I've just looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at it like, dude, if you came in after me
and you haven't put a lot of time into
[SPEAKER_01]: this name, I don't give a fuck what you
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really where it's gone because
the written rules have just been out the
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, if 95 percent of the seed,
if the seed groups are in the last five or
[SPEAKER_00]: six, seven years, and every time they make
crosses, they give a new name to those 20
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden you've got thousands
upon thousands of new names and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even keep track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You used to be able to keep track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only so many people doing it and
so many established companies and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could kind of keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I mean, Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Caleb were talking last night and
we couldn't even keep track of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other's names like we sometimes will ask
like, hey, did you use this name before
[SPEAKER_01]: because we both kind of think the same way
on names?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to go look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't even know what we've done
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I always just ask him, like,
remind me what the parents are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, he's so prolific by himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of names, you know,
and he used to remember he used to have
[SPEAKER_00]: those name auctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not auctions, but like, you know,
like crowd sourcing names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he has to come up with some of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to come up with hundreds of
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to call this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do that until every fucking name
I got was dumb as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, I'm not going to use this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way he got some good names out
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just lost you there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from your shit Mendo service,
it's actually not too bad for hill life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it isn't too bad out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not too bad where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I am in a dark corner for quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, so I think I don't even
think that, like, I would say within the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 10 years, just about everything that
was common with seeds is now flipped on
[SPEAKER_00]: its head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no males to be had.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no rules anymore, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cat's out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's no even even with
like chem cuts and different things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you can see people like try to apply
pressure on what to breed or what not to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with different types of stuff or the
hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they but they do it through social
pressure of networks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're like a joint breath and
you have no morals, you know, anybody like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they can just be like, well,
I have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do whatever I want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use it in whatever fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care about other people's
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't really control that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody you probably have seen that
picture behind me before, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the theolog from Alex Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that the theolog?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Alex Gray is like an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pretty famous and like psychedelic
circles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to be he used to teach anatomy at
Harvard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knows how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to draw the human body really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's done these paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's like, dude, he's like cult
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: His paintings go for hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not an original,
but it's like it's like a reprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's like two feet long by 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the original is like four feet by 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should see his Tom of Finland
collection, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got this killer Finland drawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to talk about erection
collections, that is definitely bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt collects collectibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, he has to keep those hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just where my money goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't really have I don't buy
toys for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, did you sell them all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you sell them all for the kids?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good that's a good man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a good dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I try, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, I mean, I I there's a what
what other etiquette can you think of that
[SPEAKER_00]: is that has changed a bunch?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I've talked about it
before, the clone circles getting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we talked about a little bit
earlier about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it every day now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people message me and they're
like, hey, I really want to get this cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell them, like, especially if
they're part of our Patreon, I tell them,
[SPEAKER_01]: just chill, just chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we say we are watching,
we're not just watching people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just watching for people to fuck
up and call them out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're watching for people with passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like we want we want to find
these people that are passionate about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis like we are that are fucking
nerds for the genetics like we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're watching and we'll yank you into
our circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we think you're fucking serious,
we will.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think a lot of people don't
have a lot of patience or don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: any of that is actively going on still.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are places it's still actively
going on to bring people into circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and because that's because the
whole preservation, I guess you could call
[SPEAKER_00]: like the whole preservation community,
whether it's history preservation or clone
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation or seed preservation,
there's only so many of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you find someone that's
willing to take the time and the effort
[SPEAKER_00]: and spend the money and care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, OK, now I got like another
now we have another crew member that has
[SPEAKER_00]: similar interests and they're actually
willing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people that want to
gain trust real fast because they want
[SPEAKER_00]: access to these things and they want to
flip it, monetize it, and they have dreams
[SPEAKER_00]: of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I feel for them because honestly,
like most of the famous cuts that I got,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got because I was around the right
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, there wasn't like,
you know, I don't want you to say the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest gumbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there wasn't anything
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just how you acted and how you were
and where you were around and who you were
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of spread from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the trading that I've done
with people that I'm personally friends
[SPEAKER_00]: with in real life and I see their face has
been positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of when I got on IG, I didn't
realize how many scammers there were.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many people would run months game
to try to get access to certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I first talked to not so
he was so bright eyed and bushy tailed and
[SPEAKER_01]: just he did not see the the negative in
people yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's had a crash course in it like we
all have, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I had to re in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crawled out of my rock and Mendo or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got on IG and started looking around
after a long hiatus of Internet action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's all these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did these different cuts survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did these different things survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, people are chatting
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was looking for people like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's maybe we should
say this to where it's like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: various people that have given that have
given like given flack thinking that like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to like release like some
expensive seeds or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's this aspect which is
hilarious if you know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because good friends of mine have been
trying to get me to do this for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like talking about historical
things that interest us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone in like a lot of these weed
podcasts, it's also infomercial Lee and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of do some promotion to
like it's all bad by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that we do so much that
doesn't even isn't even about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: People trip out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it fucks people up because
there's like, well, where's the angle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the motive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they taking two hours on a Friday
night?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bullshit because we're fucking
nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it might be that we're nerds,
but it's also the same thing where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I realize when Matt and I were
talking about doing something like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more like if we don't get a chance to
chat back and forth about how things are
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we'd like them to be or how they
were and why they were that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can just watch it all go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and maybe there's, you know,
maybe there's, you know, there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a few people listening that will
go away from that and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I liked what I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take that and apply it my own
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that etiquette with cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that etiquette with seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like trading with people that have the
similar vibe or heart to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, and so,
you know, and then you learn, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff is kind of underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you weren't there, you, you know,
you just wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that regard, we also tried to bring
back something like that a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people don't know about it,
but the nugs and jugs, like the meetups,
[SPEAKER_01]: the harvest cups that you guys would throw
up and then no private ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to bring that back for a little
bit until COVID obviously got a hold of
[SPEAKER_01]: the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, hopefully we'll be keeping that
alive as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I mean, I mean, those kind of like
gatherings where it's a few hundred people
[SPEAKER_00]: of like minded heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, like that's where,
you know, that's where I met CSI for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I met Shaw for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I met, you know, all kinds of
different people 20 years ago for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time, because it was a collection of
like minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them you bump into later
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like the Emerald Cup, you know,
I mean, the first four or five Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cups I went to, they were in Laytonville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tiny little thousand person town in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now that now it's all big and,
you know, huge and it's been in Santa Rosa
[SPEAKER_00]: or different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this like event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at its start, it was kind of just like
a like a little bit more public of one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those classic harvest vests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I enjoyed ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just said who's who's Shaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt can talk about Shaw a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaw is an old buddy of CSI's and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's some people know him as 707 Seed
Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, and he's legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's I handle business.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's another one of those old school seed
collectors, seed breeders, clone traders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in that same, you know, in 20 years,
I'll have a really good Shaw story for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that I could probably tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made me go like, dude, this guy's
fucking legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's you know, he's he was a breeder
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have I have a Bubba Cup that I
still have Shaw Bubba on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's still what it says on my tag,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it still says Shaw Bubba
because, you know, so he's just one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we could we could speak
about this, too, to people that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like, there was an aspect when
forums first started where all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: people could get on there and start
pushing the narrative that they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: About who they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe we should touch on this for a
minute, because there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: now with social media that have these
personas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these people have like small
armies of people that defend the person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never met them in real life and
don't know any of the backstory,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're in love with the persona.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's something I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I I'm a nerd for the UFO
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see it in that community,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's an aspect of humans that I
think that we don't recognize,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a religious aspect to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some some form of religiosity where we see
someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this idea of them and no one can
change that no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody says anything that counters
that narrative, it we get defensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that in in in ufology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it in politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it's in the seed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like people do love a good
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's and so in the weed
community, especially with IG right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's heroes and heels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a heel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be called the heel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's a heel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt in wrestling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's the bad guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt's the guy that you want to
see get suplexed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I have a very punchable
face and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but people have people have heroes and
then there's backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like even talking about the backstory
gets hard because so many people jump in
[SPEAKER_00]: and people have like some people have like
15 accounts, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even 20 years ago, this happened
because there was only so many new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when the forum started,
who got famous, dude, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Brothers Grimm got famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short blueberry stuff got famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was half a dozen breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people had grow threads on forums of
beautiful leads and they got super well
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had clout and people wanted
their seeds and people were buying and
[SPEAKER_00]: trading and selling amongst each other and
doing a bunch of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens today in the last four or
five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that have come on IG made a
backstory out of smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five years later, they have hundreds
of people that will defend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out of nowhere and they made up
their little past and they don't even
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they know 95 percent of people
won't won't ever hear the truth or or will
[SPEAKER_00]: or will reject it because their buddy,
the guy did something nice for him once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll never be able to ask,
for example, some guy, hey, is this dude
[SPEAKER_01]: your uncle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because they don't even have access
to ask the guy that they're just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take it on faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and some people people talk
about eventually these people do like res
[SPEAKER_00]: or swerve or different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't last forever because human
beings like aren't invulnerable to new
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, you can act enough like an
idiot over time that enough bubbles up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it's or that you just lose
interest and you can't keep the scam going
[SPEAKER_00]: for that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people that have been that
have been breeding for a long time and
[SPEAKER_00]: caring, you know, there's a lot of people
where it's like if they won the lottery,
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people were sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that we're talking about,
like if they won the lottery, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: just be stoked to do these weird projects
that they couldn't afford before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now they don't even have to rely
on it financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody said somebody said Dave
Watson, Sam, the skunk man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people can he's like one of the
most controversial characters in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that motherfucker has been on every
forum since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pitching his version of events and the
version of events that he wants people to
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a bunch of opposing views.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I just brought him up because
people were talking about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was I'm pretty sure he was know it
all for sure on Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would get on there and he would
argue about skunk one and Hayes and
[SPEAKER_00]: origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knew and people have been debating
this stuff forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would get on teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Team Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's team D.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's team misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now there's a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people where like,
you know, the the the group of breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and the group of collectors and stuff who
share a bunch of information like we
[SPEAKER_00]: basically know reasonably speaking who's
legit and who's not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's and it's not so much
about like their work or this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically whether or not like are
they a decent human being or they honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really how it shakes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like there's some like huge
behavioral like thing, but it's like are
[SPEAKER_00]: you generally honest and what you know in
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you respond a wave of
dishonest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's there's people like who
whose work like I would not do the same
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of work they're doing necessarily or
I wouldn't make the same choices they're
[SPEAKER_01]: making.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, they're they're
good human beings and they're doing what
[SPEAKER_01]: they love and they don't lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the people that that I think
are cool, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's people who like maybe
they maybe they did make a cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they suck at life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they suck at how they treat people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I'll tell you, I'm not a
musician, but I used to be in the music
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in Chicago and I used to like put
on a bunch of concerts, work at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to learn real fast between their
shitty musicians and their music sucks to
[SPEAKER_00]: their good musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I worked of all things,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked like Garth Brooks sold out the
Rosemont Horizon, which is a twenty
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand person stadium, seven nights in a
row in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got paid killer like my mother company
that I was like working for to like do
[SPEAKER_00]: stage work and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got paid amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw him put on a three hour show for
a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you lucky dog, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, they suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talented musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have time, you know, like everybody
knew how to play what they were playing
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you can think that about the
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like people don't, you know,
very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music is very much like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, talented musicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just not so much as in the punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why do they only played like
three chords?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's who need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are all their songs two minutes long?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more than one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that instrument out of tune?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't they ever harmonize?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tuning is for pussies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, I mean, it's it's it's the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can you can not like a breeder's
work and still respect their process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't prefer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this stuff that they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't love as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to work with different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's kind of that's kind
of where it is in that regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they but there's a lot
of fraud out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where Matt has gotten in trouble
and part of the reason why he's a heel and
[SPEAKER_00]: a villain is because he's been calling out
bullshit since the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tries to let people know that like,
hey, this might not be legit or you should
[SPEAKER_00]: know about this or this or that or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's abrasive or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only do you get the enemy of the
person that you're outing their bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe their little fan base,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because these people have all
invested in their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, they have a financial
incentive to want this to be true.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have a financial incentive
to make sure they didn't waste their
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they believed, you know, I believed I
dropped this much money on whoever's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can't be a fraud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this stuff can't be for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They outsource their seeds to Dean FM
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even make them themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can't be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spent a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a person I can't
remember who it was, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's this, you know,
there's all these people that are selling
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient skunk one now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that guy that there was some guy
that spent like five thousand bucks on
[SPEAKER_00]: blue skies, Vienna's fake skunk one
roadkill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he created like a whole page because
he was so pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he went through all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find what I want to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get scammed and you're like,
God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people are embarrassed and
instead of and they just they defend
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all don't have to get along either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that will never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I'm not saying Kumbaya
like some people just naturally aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be friends or see eye to eye or
their behaviors aren't going to be mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there's a difference between
like, I don't really like you as a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you're like a.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because there's some shitty ass
people that that made great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that source great seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happened, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happened, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's people that aren't the
most exemplary human beings that amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff came from stuff they hunted or stuff
they were given or stuff they stumbled
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably wouldn't exist if if if
they didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a total scumbag and asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they, you know, the seeds are still
good and it's not the seeds fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like there's original sin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into that, you know,
there's not like they're not tainted by
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, you try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you try to establish to bring it
all back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to establish norms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to talk about what's acceptable
and the reason why there's norms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most norms get set up because people
decide this fuckery can't stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some fucking rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we need so we need some like we need
some like rules of engagement to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how all these norms got
created, because back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: people on forums would fuck each other
over and then they would get it would get
[SPEAKER_00]: outed and then behavioral things would
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then they'd be ostracized and
you couldn't get stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people would self-regulate their
own behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To stay within the norms of their little
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them tried, some of them
tried, some would just go way off the deep
[SPEAKER_01]: end, pulling a BSV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, on some level,
even like in a music level, it's like at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point you stop the mosh pit and you
help people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of stomping on the girl's head who
fell over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became a norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can't have we can't have
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can't have murders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can get crazy, but we can't have
like hospital injuries and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another that's just the
norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people see things that develop and a
norm develops around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with the speed of the Internet and
the speed of IG and the speed of changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those norms are sort of out the
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can be a cool dude or chick and a
bam because it like helps you get along
[SPEAKER_00]: with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it helps you build a good
reputation and it hopes you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps you like, you know, because
that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, are you in weed for longevity
or you just send it because it's popular
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see a lot of fallout coming
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot less money in seeds than
there's ever been since day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot less money in weed in production,
especially in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to it's going to really hit
the nation hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the newest House resolution bill,
and I think it's got to go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: Senate, if it's decriminalized,
we're going to see a big change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know necessarily what that change
will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm guessing there will be either a
mass influx of more people and the and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that weren't going to make it
anyways, that we're in for the quick money
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see some more in it thinking
there's going to be quick money and have
[SPEAKER_01]: another quick bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I always used to eat back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What made seed breeding feasible for me
was that flower prices were nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When flower prices are good, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care, honestly, about I was
trying to make better weed for myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was literally the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we made plenty of money off
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could have a four lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have a couple of different things
popped around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have part of the hill that I could
breed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a little corner here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so it it's going to be it's
going to be less marketable because in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for all these seed breeders to
survive, all these seed breeders came up
[SPEAKER_00]: in an era where there was a ton of garage
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a ton of two fifteen style small
twenty five to a hundred plant grows all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of individuals and they
would come loaded down with harvest money
[SPEAKER_00]: to Emerald Cup and these different events
looking to buy seeds for the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the money tightens up and all those
small players get turned into much larger
[SPEAKER_00]: players, there's not going to be lines
that every seed company at these shows
[SPEAKER_00]: with money burning a hole in their pocket
to buy seeds that may be bunk and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change the dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a luxury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as that as that like as that
monetary reason goes out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was an era where in the
twenty five fifty plant era when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow monsters, a lot of people
believed that seed plants get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would want to grow from seed
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they're going to grow 200,
250 seeds and then select down to their
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite 50 females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grow those so they don't even care
that half of them get tossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that fueled a lot of seed
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I had to, if I was going to give
advice to people that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we get towards the end of this thing
tonight or whatever, it's like if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to breed, the best way to
breed and not be disappointed is just to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed for yourself and your friends and to
try to put weed together that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what would happen if I combine
the two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could get these traits from this
side of the plant and these traits from
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant into the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then if no money ever comes from
it or anything like that or no fame or no
[SPEAKER_00]: named cut or anything and nobody gives a
shit, at least you cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you smash jealousy and gelato
41 by biscotti and you put all this effort
[SPEAKER_00]: into it and then nobody cares and you
don't even like it, then maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you like it and you're trying to do
for something you like, at least something
[SPEAKER_00]: you like, I know people start breeding
more for high again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: For stuff you like, because I because
honestly, like in the 90s, the way we got
[SPEAKER_00]: famous was people had to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't really get famous on looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no terpene numbers or THC
numbers or anything to go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like in a bag or in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I like the effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it did those things, it kind of got
famous and spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how all elites kind of got
developed was enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and it doesn't even it doesn't even
mean that, like, everybody has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt doesn't like I've said it
before, Matt doesn't like smoking the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: 91 very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog neither does Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, so breed for what you
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you want to smoke after
being pissed off during the daytime or
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're putting on a comedy with your
lady or whatever and you want to like
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a joint and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, grow what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how I ended up with so much
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's what I love, because
people should have passions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody's putting their own
kind of flavor on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's a reason the
I've told Matt this a bunch, but like the
[SPEAKER_00]: person most responsible for making sure
that Mendo P never disappears is Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's so prolific at crossing it
into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I traded it to different friends
or whatever, gave it out freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still more people have it because he
bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why did he breed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He personally liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so you personally liking
something I think is like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you should give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should give a shit about your own
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then a lot of people and I'm not going
to name any names, you know, don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably smoke less than a lot of other
breeders because I'm not a heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke several times a day, but I'm not
like trying to get laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people who don't smoke at
all making your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have no interest at all in
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could care less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's I think it's really hard unless
you have like someone that you really
[SPEAKER_01]: trust and you trust their opinion on high
to breed that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's it's it's like,
you know, being a chef, but you don't eat
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the food you cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you're not into tasting your own
work, how really are you going to like
[SPEAKER_00]: make yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're not going to chat about it
tonight, but like the way that I the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I grow and the way that I cure the
way that I dry my weed and how I treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's like crop after crop after
crop of like learning about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this made it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is this is definitely and so it
gets refined over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you're giving yourself
feedback, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your self feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like if how are you
going to know if if the seeds you make are
[SPEAKER_00]: special, if you don't even pop any of
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you'll never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never truly know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never truly know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, any prolific breeder ends
up making way more seeds than they can
[SPEAKER_00]: ever test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Caleb's crazy unique and that he
has multiple rooms that he can regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: pop off phenol hunts in all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most breeders don't even have that luxury.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of having that much space to not only
phenol hunt, but also to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of separate locations in
order to do stuff like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're doing if you're doing
seedless and seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit drifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know seeds, seeds,
basically there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to call it all the time a labor of
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's time, it's money,
it's energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe nobody will like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is like it's it's do what you
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you start selling them,
people fucking hate you immediately,
[SPEAKER_01]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You become a fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just part of what it's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because then you have to deal
with the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may didn't germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to put a price on something
this this many.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and how many times are you going
to believe everyone and just send them
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing and just, you know, people are
talking about popping old seeds on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a bunch of stuff you can
look up on popping old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to soak them in an enzyme
or a little bleach or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super like acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three is great for old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to to to scuff them like
on a like on what you fire a match on
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a big hand cracker with with he
most stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hand crack my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's you can buy crackers
that are like little screws to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can like very lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work depends on how
they're stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had with the with the Superdog
project, my partner who I did it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: way we really lost it after I lost mine
was that he was on vacation and it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of summer and he had a breaker flip
in his garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his seed freezer turned into a seed
oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaker flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was gone and it was the middle of
July and he was gone in the Caribbean for
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of weeks and it just sat there at
120 degrees in his garage for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took we've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had hundreds of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had all kinds of friends try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried every single method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't get them to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take long for a for a good heat
flash to rain your whole collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's there's times when
it's like there was literally like I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was there was, you know,
big Ziploc bags just chock full of
[SPEAKER_00]: different different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all your seed freezer goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had I had a similar thing happened
in San Diego during one of the real hot
[SPEAKER_01]: summers in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole collection got just fucking
toasted because there's no air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioners in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't have a big I was in an
apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a big seed fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little fridge, you know,
for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't understand the full mechanics
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fucked everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's hard, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I like the other thing is
you see people are like, oh, I got these
[SPEAKER_00]: 68 whatever seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they pop them and they have like
30 seeds and 28 of them pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, even if they were stored
perfectly in the best conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get 28 out of 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not probably going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lose over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even like Dave was Sam Skunkman
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got kilos of old seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he thinks the germination rate,
even on that stuff, that's been perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still like less than 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a substantial amount for the
amount of seed that he has of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but he's still it's going to be
like four, eight or seven percent or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that germ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to I can say firsthand,
like going into a collection where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot's been ruined and trying
to pop them is fucking miserable because
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot I had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'll give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it never works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking.
Miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, somebody said the French
skunk connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess that I don't I don't like
home at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just think I think he I mean,
they claim they found skunk in the 70 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 71 or 72 out of a brick, which probably
means they maybe, you know, like at best,
[SPEAKER_00]: they found some skunky Mexican pure
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that whole thing, that whole
thing is a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like all these different people
want to say, no, we have some skunk that
[SPEAKER_00]: came comes from not Sam Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's rank and it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even caught on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it's just like that's the thing is
it's like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a there's another tsunami
of all these famous strains from the 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: and 90s that are old enough, they're
legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we had to do a whole show
on NL on NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like it's more of a legendary
name and people don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: About it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, oh, well,
what's the earliest that existed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it from two years before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow that's that's how scammers out
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just I just want people to realize
that every five it used to be like every
[SPEAKER_01]: five to ten years, someone would pop up
and say, we've got the whole SSC
[SPEAKER_01]: collection, a whole collection in jars
just pulled out of a freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this happened so many fucking times
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time it would all be bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you see people just all of a
sudden, they've got this magical freezer
[SPEAKER_01]: to Narnia be very, very, very selective
and think about it, use some critical
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If these things were still around,
they'd still be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this I have this running joke,
too, where it's like, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me your old and unpopular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this shit was old and unpopular,
like I live in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I have tons of friends and humble
and Trinity and Mendo and sort of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of cannabis people I would
hunt and hunt and hunt and hunt for this
[SPEAKER_00]: old shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was almost impossible to find
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as there's money
involved, it's everywhere, everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could spend 15 years looking for this
shit and find it nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in the last four years,
it's like out of the fucking woodwork and
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, and one person has everything
from every company you could have ever
[SPEAKER_01]: imagined from the fucking 80s through the
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's like nobody wants it to
be real more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were we were a normal industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this seed stock from Neville and SSC
and all those guys in the 90s and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: work would still be accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be maybe not for sale, but like they
would have a vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they would have like any kind of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have seed stock going back decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're not even using it,
but it's like every cultivar they've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: had, they keep seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to print more then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we talked about this too
before, but we have we have a buddy that
[SPEAKER_00]: that bought somebody's freezer that was
getting out of that was getting out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that I showed I showed that to
you and Crybaby and some other friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: people fucking blue balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and all that shit,
it's all legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all from like 08 to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even really all that old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all like what you could get in
that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common stuff during that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had Matt vibe it because honestly,
that was more his era than mine in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of being deeply involved in what was out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and almost none of it could you
buy today if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's from 10 or 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's even stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that was stuff I didn't even see
in other people's seed collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like even if even if you were doing it
for research purposes or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't even have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of why I think reversals
became so popular was because not only do
[SPEAKER_00]: you not need a male, but in many cases,
most of these lines, only one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: females from that line even survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all you have left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to keep a line unhybridized and
pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's it's changed all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was yeah, that was it's 12 years
ago and it's like reading a historical
[SPEAKER_00]: novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was is a trip and a flashback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A flashback to like and that was all
commonly sold and traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the hot shit of the minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all stuff I had my seed collection
at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have it, but you had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a little after I was
hiding under a rock then or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I talk about apparently creepy is
still around a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be suspicious of that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the fucking creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the creepy is the creepy is
like a legendary name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not specific to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the thunderfuck or, you know,
it's what people want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so anyways, we can end on that note.
[SPEAKER_01]: End it there today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job covering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we're done, I want to say don't
forget to check out the Patreon Breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to Google it because if you go to
Patreon and search Breeders Syndicate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to find us because they
don't put cannabis stuff in the search.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go to Google Breeders
Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can join us in Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always hang out in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where our crew is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to be a part of a circle,
that's the way in the first way in because
[SPEAKER_01]: we are always watching there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always watching everywhere,
but we are definitely watching there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the fights tomorrow, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some good fights we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Hawaiian Life's Drop coming
soon for the people that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon, I believe, in the next week or
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have all the hybrids up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just the way that hybrids answer
answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We respond on there a lot more than IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an easy way for friends about
friends of ours and stuff to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: and to talk to new people that get excited
about shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good way to interact that I
think is a little bit better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional way we've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to try to do this every
Friday night and bring topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a bunch of people shoot out what
topics you want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, we might have a
show that's totally based on them and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always appreciate people's Friday
nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this just to try to build
community, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the core goal is to try to get
people together, get people talking and
[SPEAKER_00]: build a little community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we always thank you for
your time very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep your ears peeled for the Hawaiian
Life's Drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both me and CSI are going to be dropping
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And go check out Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have me and CSI seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can buy it directly from me at
rideseatco.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of love.
I'll see you next time.
