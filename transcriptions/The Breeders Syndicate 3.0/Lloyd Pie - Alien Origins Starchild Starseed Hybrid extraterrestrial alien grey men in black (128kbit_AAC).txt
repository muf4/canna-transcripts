[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll start with the fact that the Bible
says that in the beginning, in the
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning, you've all heard this was the
Word.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in order to explain everything that
followed after that, the Word would have
[SPEAKER_07]: to be something on the order of this,
if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had to be a heck of a word to cover all
the essential sense of introvert.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over time, the creationists changed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They expanded it a little bit to three
words.
[SPEAKER_07]: God did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: God did everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all you needed for an answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does it rain?
[SPEAKER_07]: God did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does the wind look?
[SPEAKER_07]: God did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything, God did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that worked for a couple thousand
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple thousand years, that was all you
needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, 145 years ago, a new group of
people came on the scene, the Darwinists,
[SPEAKER_07]: with what they thought was a better,
more rational explanation, which is that
[SPEAKER_07]: nature did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't need God, but nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And nature only did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a line drawn down the middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: God here, nature here, and no mixing.
[SPEAKER_07]: No mixing.
[SPEAKER_07]: 145 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the creationists tried an end run
by bringing in a group of much smarter
[SPEAKER_07]: individuals, much better educated than the
original ones, and they're called
[SPEAKER_07]: intelligent designers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Intelligent designers.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, basically, God is at the bottom
of their theory as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: God did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is so complex, it couldn't have
happened by accident.
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, God had to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only recently has a much smaller group of
individuals started putting forth a theory
[SPEAKER_07]: called intervention.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an interventionist.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we say is that it wasn't a God
with a capital G, an anthropomorphic God,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was a group of gods, multiple people,
multiple beings, small g gods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that they did it, that's our mantra,
they did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not God did it, not nature did it,
they did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that accounts for everything in its
own way that's come to be on the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I'm going to be showing
you here basically tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my beginning, next slide please,
in my beginning, okay, in my beginning of
[SPEAKER_07]: the book, everything you know is wrong,
which is not here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We tried to ship it here, and it didn't
work out with the publisher, a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: problems, Australia, a long time,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: You will be able eventually, if you want
it, to get it through Duncan Rhodes' Nexus
[SPEAKER_07]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want, keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to order it from the states
direct, go through Barnes and Noble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barnes and Noble, that's the best ship
we're at, wwwbn.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barnes and Noble.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, what I'm trying to show in the
cover here is the interventionist point of
[SPEAKER_07]: view boiled down, that the gods,
multiple gods, small g, handed the spark
[SPEAKER_07]: of human life to the primitives that were
on the earth, at the time, by means of
[SPEAKER_07]: intervention via genetic engineering,
which is symbolized by a test tube.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the theory.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are a genetically engineered species
product, and we'll talk about that as soon
[SPEAKER_07]: as it goes by.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the beginning, in the beginning,
boy, every one of these is apparently
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be cut off at the top,
and I'm sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to fix this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the beginning, what you have is the
cloud.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the Bible's beginning was the word,
in my beginning was the book, and now in
[SPEAKER_07]: the beginning was the cloud of dust and
gas swirling around, and over about 10
[SPEAKER_07]: billion years, down to about 4.5 billion
years ago, where the solar system took the
[SPEAKER_07]: shape basically that we know now,
and the earth was basically coalesced out
[SPEAKER_07]: of the cloud as the proto-earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that proto-earth, 4.5 to 3.5
billion years ago, the proto-earth was
[SPEAKER_07]: just a seething mass of magma being
bombarded by asteroids and meteorites.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just an impossible place to live,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then as it began to cool off over time
from 3.5 to around 2.5, the next billion
[SPEAKER_07]: years, do we have cooling enough to where
we have the Siby plan beginning to show
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's still supposed to be molten
level, but at least the bombardment of
[SPEAKER_07]: meteorites and all that stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, no one would have thought at one time
that life could have begun on earth at a
[SPEAKER_07]: time like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the theory was that life didn't begin
until around 2 billion years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was cooled off enough to have water
at least, and that inorganic molecules
[SPEAKER_07]: were somehow swirled together and became a
living thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody quite understood, but since nature
was at the core of everything according to
[SPEAKER_07]: the darkness, it had to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just had to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't quite figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They kept assuring everybody, we'll figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then about 30 years ago, that was what
they talked, that's what all you were
[SPEAKER_07]: taught, that's what your kids were being
taught today, what your grandkids were
[SPEAKER_07]: being taught.
[SPEAKER_07]: But about 30 years ago, they found out
that, in fact, life had already come to
[SPEAKER_07]: earth around 4 billion years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back when it was seething magma,
you saw what it looked like, and everyone
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty much reased as to what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what came, prokaryotic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if the real beginning of life,
the beginning of life, had really started
[SPEAKER_07]: the way they say it would have been
something extremely simple, kind of like a
[SPEAKER_07]: virus, it would have been about the size
of one of these little spots in here,
[SPEAKER_07]: like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, it's this really large,
complex kind of one single-celled bacteria
[SPEAKER_07]: called prokaryotic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the one thing that distinguishes it
is though it has a number of DNA strands,
[SPEAKER_07]: it doesn't have a nucleus.
[SPEAKER_07]: The DNA is not held within a nucleus.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of floats free and loops.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what distinguishes prokaryotic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it came at about 4 billion years ago,
only about a half a billion years from
[SPEAKER_07]: when the earth was first beginning to
coalesce out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's extremely unlikely, in fact
impossible, that life formed on earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It came here whole and complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it didn't come in only one form.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two types of prokaryotic
bacteria, the archaea and the true
[SPEAKER_07]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two types.
[SPEAKER_07]: Distinct, different types.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it absolutely is for certain that life
came here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the question really is, how did it
get here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it directed here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it sent here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it delivered here or approached here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it just accidentally show up somehow?
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the question that has to be
answered now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, for the prokaryotic bacteria,
the thing you need to keep in mind about
[SPEAKER_07]: it is it is indestructible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indestructible.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's so cool about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The earth got what it needed exactly when
it needed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it was just beginning, if you want to
turn a planet into something that can
[SPEAKER_07]: support how our life forms, you've got to
give it something that will turn the
[SPEAKER_07]: environment and turn oxygen loose in the
atmosphere and in the water to tie up the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to have free iron to turn the
iron into rust, iron oxide, and then have
[SPEAKER_07]: an excess of oxygen so that higher life
forms can live on that place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly what the earth needed,
which these creatures right here do that,
[SPEAKER_07]: they got early on, two forms, all
indestructible early on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_07]: What an amazing coincidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: An amazing coincidence, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and two billion years ago,
remember we've gone now two billion years
[SPEAKER_07]: approximately, two billion years with the
prokaryotes from four billion years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just those two kinds, and then suddenly
around two billion years ago, these things
[SPEAKER_07]: appear out of nowhere, just like the
prokaryotes did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of nowhere come the eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have strata with that, and suddenly
you have strata with it, and here they
[SPEAKER_07]: are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're extremely complicated,
hundreds to thousands of times larger than
[SPEAKER_07]: the prokaryotes, with a nucleus
surrounding many, many, many more strands
[SPEAKER_07]: of DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a sophisticated, yet still
one-celled creature pumping out much more
[SPEAKER_07]: oxygen, much more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they couldn't come any sooner because
the earth wasn't prepared.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are fragile.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are not indestructible.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are indestructible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they couldn't come until the earth had
been fixed to a certain extent by the
[SPEAKER_07]: prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two billion years of prokaryotic activity
allowed these to appear.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they do appear, the Darwinists,
with the prokaryotes, they can argue that,
[SPEAKER_07]: well, they came from, you know,
maybe space from a meteorite or something
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the eukaryotes have to be explained in
practical terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's the only way that could have
happened if you don't see any transition
[SPEAKER_07]: from prokaryotes to eukaryotes?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, from no nucleus to a nucleus,
from none of this to all of this,
[SPEAKER_07]: how did it happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: What they say is this.
[SPEAKER_07]: That after a couple of billion years of
living side by side, the larger
[SPEAKER_07]: prokaryotes suddenly decide to eat some of
the smaller prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And instead of becoming food, the smaller
prokaryotes change their physical
[SPEAKER_07]: structure into all these different things,
including the nucleus of the eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That magically, somehow, they cannibalized
each other and it worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a new, much more sophisticated living
thing came to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for as absurd as it sounds,
it's gospel among the biologists.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous, but it is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is how they say it happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: These turned into all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: After another billion and a half years
from two billion years to around 560
[SPEAKER_07]: million years ago, just rounded off at 500
million, give or take.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another billion and a half with the
prokaryotes and the eukaryotes pumping
[SPEAKER_07]: oxygen into the atmosphere, tying up the
iron, making iron oxide and having an
[SPEAKER_07]: excess of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Suddenly, out of nowhere, you have the
seas filled with creatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is called a Camry explosion,
and it's exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thousands of species of animals and plants
none of them looking anything like
[SPEAKER_07]: anything we have on Earth today,
except a horseshoe crab.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only thing that's left and it
looks kind of like maybe the descendant of
[SPEAKER_07]: this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, they don't look like
anything we have today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, it came out of nowhere within
about a five million year period,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is an item compared to all the
billions of years that have come preceding
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Camry explosion, there it all is.
[SPEAKER_07]: All 26 animal phyla that we have today
came at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, overnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: No catastrophe, nothing leading into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just came and came and happened and it
was big.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the timeline I have to show you
what I've been telling you.
[SPEAKER_07]: The beginning is at 4.5 and then you have
the bombardment and there are the
[SPEAKER_07]: prokaryotes at around four billion years
ago while the bombardment was still going
[SPEAKER_07]: on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Prokaryotes, prokaryotes, prokaryotes down
here two billion years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the eukaryotes joined them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And notice that they're still the same
today as they were when they started out.
[SPEAKER_07]: No appreciable, no Darwinian evolution at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would think that the first and the
simplest would have had a heck of a lot as
[SPEAKER_07]: we told you a while ago, but they don't
seem to now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They seem to read as true today as they
did then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so the eukaryotes and the
prokaryotes continue on and right here in
[SPEAKER_07]: this little blink right here, that little
window, is the five to ten million years
[SPEAKER_07]: when the Camry explosion occurred.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after that came the full panoply
of complex life as we know it.
[SPEAKER_07]: In only the last 5.5 billion, half a
billion years, 500 million years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a small part of what came before.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of complex life as we know it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did it happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the Darwinians tell us is that this
is the way it happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: It went from eat, survive, reproduce,
eat, survive, reproduce, to this guy who
[SPEAKER_07]: can stand here and say, what's it all
about?
[SPEAKER_07]: That it was the fish became amphibians and
amphibians become reptiles, reptiles
[SPEAKER_07]: become mammals and birds, and mammals
become us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are two parts to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two parts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Macroevolution and microevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is species into species into species
into species.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the cornerstone of Darwinian
evolution is macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Darwin himself said, I can see at this
point in time when I'm doing this in the
[SPEAKER_07]: middle late 1800s, excuse me, 1850s,
that we are short of transitional species
[SPEAKER_07]: in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that we know to look, we're going
to find species that are going to exist in
[SPEAKER_07]: the cracks here that are going to show a
transition here from one to another.
[SPEAKER_07]: The missing links.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be found, Darwin said.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they are not, it will be clear that my
theory is wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they've been looking now for 145
years, and they still don't have one
[SPEAKER_07]: single solitary unambiguous transition
from one species to another.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem is there should be
hundreds, literally hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now what they argue is that, well,
we don't have a complete fossil record
[SPEAKER_07]: yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't hold us to account on this
because the fossil record is not complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what the reality of it is is whole
sheets of it are complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have whole sheets that are
complete, and then you have sections that
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you'll have more sections that are
complete, and then you'll have sections
[SPEAKER_07]: that aren't complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're hiding behind the fact that
the fossil record isn't completely filled
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the truth of it is, within the areas,
the long sheets, the long periods of time
[SPEAKER_07]: that are complete, there are no
transitional species.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they know the theory is wrong,
and they've known it for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they can't acknowledge that it's wrong
because the creationists are standing
[SPEAKER_07]: right there and went knocking on the door
saying, well, if you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_07]: going on, we want our theory to be talking
to students.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Darwinists don't want that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_07]: The creationist's point of view should be
kept in churches where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they weren't so belligerent about that,
the Darwinists could acknowledge and admit
[SPEAKER_07]: what they don't know, and we'd have a much
better chance of getting to the truth of
[SPEAKER_07]: what really happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as long as the situation is as it is
with the creationists, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: stuck with the Darwinists pretending that
somehow Darwinian evolution and the
[SPEAKER_07]: transitional species are going to be
found.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, this is microevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is indeed a real point of fact in the
world around us.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are Hawaiian honey creepers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Darwin saw this phenomena of creatures
adapting themselves in part on the block
[SPEAKER_07]: of xylons.
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw it with Darwin's finches.
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw it with tortoises.
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw it with other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what he said was, OK, if we can see
changes in parts as clearly as this,
[SPEAKER_07]: we can extrapolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can assume that changes in whole bodies
are not out of the question and,
[SPEAKER_07]: in fact, are logical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is logical to assume that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is it doesn't work in
reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: The evidence is just not there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is microevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He saw it first and documented it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is no, to this day, true
macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't extend past the parts.
[SPEAKER_07]: The honey creeper is still a honey
creeper.
[SPEAKER_07]: It still reproduces like a honey creeper
still, just like a honey creeper is a,
[SPEAKER_07]: all these honey creepers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Microevolution, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Macroevolution, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the macroevolution of man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Supposedly, we start out around four
million years ago, maybe five million
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago, as a couple, as a pair of
upright walking chimps and upright walking
[SPEAKER_07]: gorillas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Known as the Australopithecines.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they go from around four million years
ago, not billion now, four million,
[SPEAKER_07]: to around two million years ago,
when a new type of being appears.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are called the early homos,
the early men.
[SPEAKER_07]: Early men, homo erectus, homo villus,
homo erectus, down to the endothelm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then suddenly, around 120,000 years
ago, you have a new thing that is,
[SPEAKER_07]: again, as completely different as this one
is from this one, from this one to this
[SPEAKER_07]: one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pro-agnon, pro-agnon, around 120,000 years
ago in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they're trying to tell you,
they want us all to believe, that this is
[SPEAKER_07]: somehow a transition.
[SPEAKER_07]: When in fact, at each of these stages,
there is a transformation, whole and
[SPEAKER_07]: complete.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are upright walking chimps and
gorillas.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are more man-like, but they are
still very unhuman-like.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are your true humans that only
120,000 years ago in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you go from four million years for
these guys, down to two million of these,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then down to 120,000 for the grown
man-like.
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, walking is the key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back a few more, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me stress something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking is the key to what makes these and
these be considered pre-humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking, walking is the key.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what walking is, according to
Darwinists, is a sure sign that something
[SPEAKER_07]: is on the way to learning to be a human.
[SPEAKER_07]: They say that this is a process of
learning.
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts with walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: They used to say the brains first and
everything followed that until they found
[SPEAKER_07]: these guys and found out they had brains
like chimps and gorillas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said, all right, well,
then it was walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking came first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not tool use, not brains, walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So walking is the key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking is very important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the thing is, do you really learn to
walk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you go from being a quadruped,
down on all fours, to being upright on all
[SPEAKER_07]: twos?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you biologically change your body to
do that by sheer adaptation?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you could.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's how you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is the theory as it's put forth,
believed, and preached as gospel,
[SPEAKER_07]: that as the forests of Africa began to
shrink, some group of quadrupeds decided
[SPEAKER_07]: to get out of the forests, move out onto
the savannas, move out onto the savannas,
[SPEAKER_07]: and begin to stand upright more and more
and more and more.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, just stand up to look over the
grass and then go back down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stand up to look over the grass for lions
and tigers and whatever, and do that over
[SPEAKER_07]: and over and over again for hundreds and
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that process, as they're standing
up to look over the grass for the
[SPEAKER_07]: predators that are coming to eat them,
they end up, at the end of those thousands
[SPEAKER_07]: of years, standing upright like us,
becoming upright walking creatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is, again, a theory as it's
taught and as it's believed and as it's
[SPEAKER_07]: preached.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is, how do you get through
thousands of generations when,
[SPEAKER_07]: as soon as you come out of those trees and
walk out onto the savanna, you are nothing
[SPEAKER_07]: but a walking snack tree?
[SPEAKER_07]: You have no fans, you have no claws,
you have no tough skin or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just a big bag of food moving to
the big cats out on the savanna.
[SPEAKER_07]: It requires that you have generation after
generation doing this, altering their
[SPEAKER_07]: bodies as they move, as they learn to
stand upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get from the beginning to the
end, because everything in between has
[SPEAKER_07]: been eaten by the big cats.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, that is what they do,
because from their point of view,
[SPEAKER_07]: it can't happen any other way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has to be the way it happened,
and yet, common sense tells anybody that
[SPEAKER_07]: it could.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, where do these walking creatures come
from?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clear that they're walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the tracks at Laetoli at 3.2
million years ago, perfectly upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have Lucy at 3.2 million years ago,
perfectly upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 3.5 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hips and everything, pelvis arranged to
walk upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know they're walking upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they couldn't learn it in the way that
we just described, we just talked about,
[SPEAKER_07]: where'd it come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect answer, never talked about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect answer, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Miocene.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Miocene here goes from around 25
million years ago out here to around 5
[SPEAKER_07]: million years ago right here into the
Pliocene.
[SPEAKER_07]: In those 20 million years, you have two
dozen, two dozen genera of apes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Apes, not monkeys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Monkeys are from 35 million years to 25
million years.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have nothing but monkeys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've been around about 10 million
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when the apes, when the Miocene apes
hit the scene, hit the fossil record,
[SPEAKER_07]: they dominated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very few monkeys, lots of apes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of apes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of them, now we're talking
tailless apes.
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 different species, a couple of dozen
genera.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking a lot of different kinds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking from small ones,
given sized, up to man sized, up to giant
[SPEAKER_07]: sized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Touch that roof of their heads,
gigantopithecus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every size ape you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what else?
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of those 50 different species,
the 24 genera, have come only four
[SPEAKER_07]: survivors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only four survivors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chimpanzees, gorillas, gibbons,
orangutans.
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened to the rest of them all?
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they say, science tells us that all
of these, all of these were quadrupeds
[SPEAKER_07]: down on all fours because the only four
that came out that they acknowledged are
[SPEAKER_07]: quadrupeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have the real problem,
next slide, with the short arm apes.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of them, like the oconsul,
for example, have arms that are equal in
[SPEAKER_07]: length to their legs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they try to say that, well,
they must have walked like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're a quadruped,
a true quadruped, your arms have to be
[SPEAKER_07]: longer than your legs for you to walk
comfortably, for you to locomote,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not walking, for you to locomote
comfortably, your arms have to be longer
than your legs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, keep in mind, our arms are shorter
than our legs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Significantly shorter.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Miocene apes have arms that are
equal to the length of their legs
[SPEAKER_07]: approximately, which means that their arms
would dangle down around their knees if
[SPEAKER_07]: they were to walk upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are, the short arm apes are real
embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why you don't hear much out of
them, the Miocene.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they don't have legs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to imply that they were
walking.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they were.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no other way for a short arm ape
to locomote comfortably, except on two
[SPEAKER_07]: feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very, very fair to assume that
those short arm Miocene apes were walking
[SPEAKER_07]: upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that, what we find in the fossil
record at four and five, and now they're
[SPEAKER_07]: arguing six million years ago,
walking upright, there's just nothing more
[SPEAKER_07]: than the Miocene apes walking right out of
the Miocene doing what they'd always done,
[SPEAKER_07]: the short arm apes walking upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they try to do with pre-humans,
to make you think, to brainwash you into
[SPEAKER_07]: believing these things really were
pre-human, is that they put these butt
[SPEAKER_07]: ugly heads on human bodies, human looking
bodies, and you come to believe,
[SPEAKER_07]: you come to think that that's how it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in fact, there's nothing at all human
about these bodies of pre-humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bones are different, bones are thicker,
heavier, arms are longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing about it is the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we see the early homo-strag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, over here to the left, this thing's
giving out the australopithecines.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these aren't working at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna just give it up and just use my
hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, the australopithecines would be
here, this is homo habilis, homo erectus,
[SPEAKER_07]: neanderthal, and then over here,
pro-magnum, right in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now all of these are indeed transitional
forms, transitional.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a transformation from these to
this, just the same way that you have a
[SPEAKER_07]: transformation here from the
australopithecines to here,
[SPEAKER_07]: transformation, and then you have
basically the brains are just getting
[SPEAKER_07]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically it, the brains are just
getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with the skulls themselves,
the bones are very heavy compared to
[SPEAKER_07]: algae, very thick compared to algae.
[SPEAKER_07]: The brow ridges are very heavy and thick
compared to algae.
[SPEAKER_07]: The eyes are big, round, night vision
eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have eyes like this, you have night
vision.
[SPEAKER_07]: Noses, look how big and wide the noses
are, the nasal passages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big, wide, flat noses.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a mouth sticking off the face.
[SPEAKER_07]: These teeth are jutting out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to see this, but they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have no chance, if the jaws were
here, you'd see they have no chance of
[SPEAKER_07]: just slanting back.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy, pro-magnum, comes from all this
with exactly the opposite in every way.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a forehead, they all lack a
forehead.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just go back from the eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a forehead, very reduced brow
ridges, very reduced eye sockets and poor
[SPEAKER_07]: night vision.
[SPEAKER_07]: A nose pinched up off the face,
a mouth squashed back in flat and the chin
[SPEAKER_07]: sticking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly the opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet somehow that's supposed to be a
transition if you go from this one looking
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty much the same as this one to this
one and suddenly, totally different,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's a transition.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is somehow a natural flow of events.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, even the Darwinists acknowledge that
can't be.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they say, all right, well, yeah,
we acknowledge that real problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna plug that hole with a missing
link that's gonna go in there and show
[SPEAKER_07]: some transition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the problem is, anybody that knows
anything, they need a couple of dozen to
[SPEAKER_07]: transition from this to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a couple of dozen species in
there to show that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have a finger on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no missing link in the human
chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never has been, never gonna be.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no missing link.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a plug in a huge gaping hole in
Darwinian theory because again,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're trying to keep the creationists at
bay as long as probably they'll do
[SPEAKER_07]: anything, say anything, pull any absurdity
out of the hat to keep the charade alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, if everything I'm telling you
is true and these guys are not pre-humans
[SPEAKER_07]: as we're told, what are they?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're there, they're in the fossil
record.
[SPEAKER_07]: They lasted for millions of years and they
walked upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_07]: They are hominoids, hominoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hominoids are human-like creatures that
are not really human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hominoids, what are hominoids?
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have them here, we have them there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all over the world, every
continent except in our group.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Yowie, Almas,
they have names wherever they are in the
[SPEAKER_07]: world.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are everywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are deep forests, jungles,
and swamps.
[SPEAKER_07]: They live in the parts of the world that
we don't live in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we think that we are everywhere,
that we know everything about our planet,
[SPEAKER_07]: that there's no place that we don't really
know about, that we haven't been on,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that is absolute garbage.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so untrue.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the United States alone, which is a
very populated country, very well-covered
[SPEAKER_07]: country, in the United States alone,
25% of the land has never once been foot
[SPEAKER_07]: surveyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never once foot survey was going there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too hard, too difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: The terrain is too difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is where they live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in Australia, I don't know what it
is, but people are telling me that if you
[SPEAKER_07]: fly over huge parts of Australia,
you just look down, it's just a blanket of
[SPEAKER_07]: trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: People never live in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's the same here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same wherever you get the reports
of these creatures living.
[SPEAKER_07]: Upright, walking, hair-covered primates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just upright, walking chimps and gorillas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Myocene apes, they've been doing like
this, been living on this earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been their planet since the
Myocene, 20 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been out there making their
living, living in those places where we
[SPEAKER_07]: don't live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, to this day, 50% of the arable
land on the earth, 50%, take away the ice
[SPEAKER_07]: caps, take away the deserts, arable land,
50% of it considered terra incognita.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: We basically don't know what's out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't live there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We live in about half, to any extent,
in about half of the arable land of the
[SPEAKER_07]: earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's plenty of room for them to roam,
to be, to live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plenty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect example, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Panaman was the 1800s hominoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how now, in the last 50 years,
we hear about the hominoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Alley, all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the early part of the 1800s,
it was the Panaman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stories kept coming out of China of a
black and white bear that ate bamboo.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, every expert in the world
knew that was impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: That there were no vegetarian bears,
they were omnivores, and that they were
[SPEAKER_07]: black and white, brown, other colored
bears, but not two-toned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until in 1869, a French naturalist sent
the hide of one back to the French Museum
[SPEAKER_07]: of Natural History, and they stuffed it
and knew what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then every scientist who had been
saying that such a thing is impossible
[SPEAKER_07]: said, well, we were just maintaining
healthy skepticism as scientists are
[SPEAKER_07]: supposed to do, instead of admitting to
the fact that they were just ruling it out
[SPEAKER_07]: because it was beyond their conception,
their imagination.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they said, now that we know they're
for real, we're going to get off our
[SPEAKER_07]: thumbs, and we're going to go out there,
and we're going to be the first to bring
[SPEAKER_07]: another one in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sichuan Province, China, it's not that big
a place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just tough, rugged terrain,
mountainous, with bamboo forests instead
[SPEAKER_07]: of regular forests.
[SPEAKER_07]: But other than that, how long do you think
it took to bring in the next one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they knew it was there, and they
were sending in top-quality teams to find
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How long do you think it took?
[SPEAKER_07]: 60 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: 60 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then over the next 20 years,
they brought in a half a dozen more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to this day, it's really hard to go
out into those jungles, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: those bamboo forests, and find a live
panda from the wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's a panda doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a brightly colored, slow-moving,
dim-witted animal that really doesn't do
[SPEAKER_07]: anything, lives in the day, doesn't hide,
doesn't do anything sophisticated to stay
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the way of getting caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is we don't function well in
its environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we think we function well
everywhere, but we don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so imagine, if you will, a creature
that is bigger, faster, lives at night,
[SPEAKER_07]: eats anything, can really move if it wants
to, and is an absolute master of its
[SPEAKER_07]: environment, and it is smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, imagine going out and trying to find
that, but you can't find pandas that are
[SPEAKER_07]: really stupid animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't going to happen deliberately.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to see these creatures
accidentally, and that's how it happens,
[SPEAKER_07]: when it happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it happens about 150 times a year
around the world, good science.
[SPEAKER_07]: About 150 times every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, when it happens, evidence is left
behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the evidence, in most cases,
is tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: In most cases, it's tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, right now, over the last 50 years
that we've been keeping track,
[SPEAKER_07]: about 10,000 plaster cast photographs,
or both, of tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of which, according to the Darwinian
paradigm, the Darwinian mainstream,
[SPEAKER_07]: is impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hominoids can't exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't exist, but the Darwinian
paradigm crumbles.
[SPEAKER_07]: It crumbles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it hard to know one way or the other
whether these things do exist,
[SPEAKER_07]: based on the proof that they leave behind?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because they're big creatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're heavy creatures, and they leave
tracks, and tracks are, indeed,
[SPEAKER_07]: readable.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a whole range of science called
technology that does nothing but read the
[SPEAKER_07]: tracks left in fossil shales and other
fossils of creatures that lived,
[SPEAKER_07]: millions of years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if they can read those tracks and
tell you what those animals look like,
[SPEAKER_07]: they can read the tracks of hominoids and
tell you what they look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: But suddenly, when it comes time to read a
hominoid track, all rules are out the
[SPEAKER_07]: window, and they have to be false.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can't even get them out of their
offices, hardly, to go out and take a
[SPEAKER_07]: look.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only a handful of scientists that support
the reality of hominoids will go out and
[SPEAKER_07]: take a look.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get them to go by because it
can't be real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it isn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's what you get when you go out
and take a look.
[SPEAKER_07]: When a living, fleshy foot with all its
multiple bones makes a track in a suitable
[SPEAKER_07]: medium, in doing so, it pushes the medium
out sequentially, smoothly, flowingly out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you get are lines, cracks in the
inside of the tracks called compression
[SPEAKER_07]: lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vertical little lines along here,
very easy to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you take a phony foot of any kind,
wood, plaster, plastic, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not going to articulate the way a
real, living, fleshy foot does.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when it goes down, you have to press it
or stamp it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you do that, the medium pushes
out in a completely different way.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get these impact ridges on the sides,
and the lines crack on the outside instead
[SPEAKER_07]: of the inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we can give this a little lesson to a
group of first graders, six-year-old kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them magnifying glasses as many
tracks as you want out here, phony and
[SPEAKER_07]: real, and they won't miss one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, every track that shows the
compression lines that the real ones
[SPEAKER_07]: produce, in that case and that case only,
can't be true.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be faked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some kind of way, the fakers have figured
out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How to produce articulating feet that,
instead of making fake Bigfoot tracks all
[SPEAKER_07]: over the world, all they have to do is
apply that technology to prosthesis,
[SPEAKER_07]: and people with missing limbs could walk a
heck of a lot better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'd be millionaires to boot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, all this faking's been going
on for like 50 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's how a human foot works.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the heel coming down because our
angle sits to the rear of our foot,
[SPEAKER_07]: so we have a heel strike.
[SPEAKER_07]: We come down hard on the heel.
[SPEAKER_07]: The momentum swings around the outside of
our arch, it cuts over here to the ball of
[SPEAKER_07]: our foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes out on our toe, our big toe acts
as a thrusting mechanism.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our four other toes act as balancers,
and they pull up and leave an undisturbed
[SPEAKER_07]: line of medium underneath here while this
flattens out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we see is a drawing of exactly
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see the heel strike.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see the momentum swinging around the
arch.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see it cut over under the ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see it thrust out through the big toe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see the four toes here acting as
balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how hominoids walk.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a big foot track, 16 inches long,
7 inches wide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very typical track.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see something very different.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see an angle set up here toward the
middle of the foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see an extended heel.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see a widened heel.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see a shortened forefoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see a very widened forefoot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see all five toes acting as balancers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the medium through here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the thrusting mechanism is the
whole forefoot here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most importantly, instead of that
swinging around the arch and having an
[SPEAKER_07]: imbalanced kind of walk, this thing has a
no heel strike.
[SPEAKER_07]: The foot comes down together and the line
of momentum is straight up the shoe.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see that right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: A totally different foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: A totally different foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking a totally different foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming away from us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Tracks of Leah told me 3.2 million years
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how they look.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how they walk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And furthermore, they walk better than we
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that foot, instead of like us
coming down, heel strike, toe out,
[SPEAKER_07]: heel strike, toe out, that foot's coming
down smoothly, smoothly.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing is walking better than us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's keeping its knees unlocked,
bent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's using its muscles.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's muscles in its thigh.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's muscles in its behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: The way to do it, the right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Its joints don't wear out like ours do.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at us walking in slow motion,
we're actually doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing it inefficiently.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're locking our knees.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're throwing ourselves through our hips.
[SPEAKER_07]: And over time, our joints wear out.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we get old, all you have to do is go
into nursing home and you can see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't happen if we were walking
correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something is wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys do it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's another one, and it's a different
foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what this one shows is that there are
different feet among the hominoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fundamentally the same, but check the
difference in the toes.
[SPEAKER_07]: These toes are all the same size.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the peas and the pod type.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, still, all five of them act as
balancers, forefoot, ankle in the middle,
[SPEAKER_07]: extended heel.
[SPEAKER_07]: The same different design of a different
toe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have the same fundamental foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have different ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very unusual.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dermal ridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the best hominoid tracks, dermal ridges
show up very clearly.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are dermal ridges?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the fingerprints, your
fingerprints, of your feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how when a baby's born,
the hands are too small to do the
[SPEAKER_07]: fingerprints?
[SPEAKER_07]: They just do the whole foot.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Print the foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fingerprints on your feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dermal ridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do they say?
[SPEAKER_07]: What does the Darwinist say when they see
a hominoid track?
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, with dermal ridges, whoever faked
it took the time to sit down and carve a
[SPEAKER_07]: hominoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: When, in fact, they're so fine and so
complicated, and each one is unique.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, each one is unique.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lasers couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet somehow those fakers have taken
trouble to sit down and make a foot that
[SPEAKER_07]: fully articulates so that it leaves
compression lines, and it leaves dermal
[SPEAKER_07]: ridges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those fakers know their business.
[SPEAKER_07]: See how silly it is?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely absurd.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a stride comparison with a
six-foot man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the track here and the track here.
[SPEAKER_07]: See how it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody was indeed faking them and
wearing fake tracks, because they go into
[SPEAKER_07]: the mediums at such depth that we can
judge how much they weigh, we know they're
[SPEAKER_07]: weighing 500 pounds, 600 pounds,
700 pounds, 800 pounds, tens.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can tell from the medium
acknowledge you can do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing what they can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means that the person who's making
these tracks has to be in the range of
[SPEAKER_07]: seven, eight feet tall themselves,
and they have to be very heavy people to
[SPEAKER_07]: begin with, and then they have to put 300
or 400 pounds on a barbell and carry that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Making the tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is if it's a human foot,
it's going to have a deep heel prep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have the standard heel
impact that we have in those which is not
[SPEAKER_07]: visible in the hominoid tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clear that these are living creatures
making these tracks that don't walk the
[SPEAKER_07]: way we do, don't walk anywhere close to
us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just forget about the size difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: The walk is not the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here is the difference in the way that
the foot's put together.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been studied by Grover Cranston.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was an anatomist, human anatomist,
foot anatomist, and he said, my estimate
[SPEAKER_07]: is that 31% of the total foot length is
behind the ankle joint compared with only
[SPEAKER_07]: 23% in humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you see, you're looking at a
fundamental redesign.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's so much bigger, denser,
thicker, heavier body.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the hominoids, whether they're small
or whether they're big, and by the way,
[SPEAKER_07]: there are different sizes of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are pygmy size, there are human
size, and there are the giant size.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bigfoot, Sasquatch, those are the giant
size.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yowies, I'm sure you've heard,
you have the tall ones and you have the
[SPEAKER_07]: more human ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the same thing there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything seems to get lumped around the
big ones because the big ones are so
[SPEAKER_07]: awesome, but there are many that are seen
that are human size.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are different types.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the Miocene apes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the Miocene apes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are, these are Miocene apes living
today amongst us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their planet.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are the indigenous, upright,
walking primates of planet Earth,
[SPEAKER_07]: the hominoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we see the redesign.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now also, I want you to keep in mind the
difference in motion, the forward motion,
[SPEAKER_07]: the way the momentum carries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much better here than here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a look at the difference in the
shadow or the area that they put down,
[SPEAKER_07]: and he says, thus, last line, thus the
Sasquatch foot, thus the Sasquatch foot at
[SPEAKER_07]: a given statute has just a trace over
twice the surface area of a human foot at
[SPEAKER_07]: a given size, twice the surface area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's supporting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where that given size is, it's supporting
a much bigger body, so you need a much
[SPEAKER_07]: broader platform and a much thicker sole
to be able to walk barefoot for the entire
[SPEAKER_07]: life supporting that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you saw in the other drawings,
it's thicker on the bottom, thicker on the
[SPEAKER_07]: sole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now here's a comparison of a standard 10
and a half foot, about my size,
[SPEAKER_07]: and a standard Bigfoot 15, 10 by five and
15 by six and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, keep the Bigfoot look,
the hominoid look in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very different than a human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we see another pair of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these, it looks like this because
instead of being dirt, this was taken from
[SPEAKER_07]: clay, from hardened clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, in every other respect,
these are hominoid tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they not?
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't they look exactly the same?
[SPEAKER_07]: Wide heel, ankle up, toe, way they work?
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are hominoid tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they not?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they aren't, as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not hominoid tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are, in fact, without doubt,
Neanderthal tracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neanderthal tracks taken from a cave,
Toriano-Willi, 30,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubt about it, Neanderthal artifacts.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are Neanderthal tracks looking
exactly like hominoid prints of this day,
[SPEAKER_07]: which would lead one to suspect that
perhaps Neanderthals might be hominoids
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than pre-humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we have the feet of Neanderthals.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the feet of any other
pre-humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turns out when wild creatures eat you,
the first thing they go for is your feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a cherry on a sundae or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for whatever reason, we have very few
feet of Neanderthals out of the fossil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have whole feet of Neanderthals
because a few of them got buried.
[SPEAKER_07]: A few got buried.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we have is a comparison here
of a Neanderthal foot, human foot,
[SPEAKER_07]: human foot, Neanderthal foot, and look at
the difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the huge extension of the heel
here relative to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the ankle moving forward and
widening compared to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the flattening of the arch
compared to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most importantly, look at the kind of
sway that you have here in our foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just see the imbalance caused by
our momentum working around our arch as
[SPEAKER_07]: opposed to this big, flat, poop,
solid thing with the heel, the big,
[SPEAKER_07]: wide ankle by comparison shifted forward,
the widening of the forefoot, the forefoot
[SPEAKER_07]: being the thrusting mechanism,
the big toe here being the dominant room
[SPEAKER_07]: for the little balancers as opposed to
these big, all five of them working as
[SPEAKER_07]: balancers.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very different, it's the same
bones.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing, isn't the same bones
completely redesigned for a different
[SPEAKER_07]: function.
[SPEAKER_07]: And understand that this foot is wrapping
around here like it's a big, wide foot
[SPEAKER_07]: relative to this one right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that you see in a hominord foot
is sitting right here in the Neanderthal
[SPEAKER_07]: foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with the, comparing with the
drawings, you see the difference very
[SPEAKER_07]: clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just what the guy drew is what you get and
what you see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pre-human feet are hominoid feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the pre-humans, that's all the
australopithecines, that's all the early
[SPEAKER_07]: homos, up through the Neanderthal to
Cro-Bagon, those are hominoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not pre-humans, just Miocene apes living
their lives and leaving their traces in
[SPEAKER_07]: the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_07]: Humans don't appear in the fossil record
until 120,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Suddenly, overnight, like everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they do now, try to get you to
believe part of the brainwashing is that
[SPEAKER_07]: Neanderthals, which initially were
considered broods pretty much like what
[SPEAKER_07]: they are, they now just ugly humans
wearing furs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Neanderthals clearly lived during
the ice ages anywhere the ice ages were at
[SPEAKER_07]: their worst.
[SPEAKER_07]: So somehow they were living at sub-zero
temperatures and so they'd wrap them up in
[SPEAKER_07]: fur.
[SPEAKER_07]: You take any of these guys and you put
them one night above the Arctic Circle,
[SPEAKER_07]: just above the Arctic Circle, which was
not as bad as it was during the ice ages,
[SPEAKER_07]: and those folks are dead.
[SPEAKER_07]: One night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fur is not going to make, not going to get
a human through that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have a different physiology to
survive that kind of climate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Neanderthals clearly did,
because they did it from a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: thousand years.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were covered in fur.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a different physiology than we
did.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to see the true face of the
Neanderthal, next slide, it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: look an awful lot more like this,
which is really, than anything like what
it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing human on the horizon until you get
to Coromandel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything prior to that looking like
this, covered with hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if everything I'm telling you is
true, where did we come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: If the Earth belongs to the upright
indigenous primates from Mycenae,
[SPEAKER_07]: where did we come from?
[SPEAKER_07]: How did we get here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I choose to believe the best
evidence that I have is from the work of a
[SPEAKER_07]: man named Zechariah Sitchin, which I'm not
going to go into in great detail here,
[SPEAKER_07]: but just to tell you that Sumer,
the original culture that we have,
[SPEAKER_07]: that we accept, that scientists and
scholars accept, that's the first one
[SPEAKER_07]: around 5,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sumer, which is modern day Iraq,
Tiger, Shefretis, modern day Iraq where
[SPEAKER_07]: the wars went on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That culture appeared out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: That came from the Stone Age, out of the
Zagros Mountains supposedly, down into the
[SPEAKER_07]: valley there and produced this fantastic
culture that gave us over a hundred of the
[SPEAKER_07]: firsts that we attribute to a society.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, how did they do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: How did they produce a culture that was as
good as and in many ways better than the
[SPEAKER_07]: later Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans?
[SPEAKER_07]: Come right out of the Stone Age and boom,
just explode.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a wonderful culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did they do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just leave that one off the table
because it's just too impossible to
[SPEAKER_07]: explain it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you're really taught about the
Sumerians, if you went to school and you
[SPEAKER_07]: were taught anything about the Sumerians
at all, you were taught one thing,
[SPEAKER_07]: you were going to be right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the hundred and something things they
introduced, next slide, they introduced
[SPEAKER_07]: writing, cuneiform.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have over a hundred,
that would be united if we didn't have the
[SPEAKER_07]: hundred thousand plus tablets,
many of which got stolen by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them the Americans invaded.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might remember that both the tablets
and silver seals were confiscated and
[SPEAKER_07]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_07]: But nonetheless, it's unfortunate because
only about 20% of them had been translated
[SPEAKER_07]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the 20% were translated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many, about 5,000 of them told things
about their history.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of them were about business and
business deals and who owned who,
[SPEAKER_07]: how many sheep, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: About 5,000 of them told stories that the
Sumerians believed about themselves,
[SPEAKER_07]: about their history.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all considered mythology.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our scientists consider it total mythology
because it just can't be true of the
[SPEAKER_07]: things they were saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were saying things like this,
that multiple gods came down from the
[SPEAKER_07]: heavens, lived on the earth, needed a
slave and a servant, created that slave
[SPEAKER_07]: and a servant in a house of fashion,
basically a genetic engineering lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only did they create humans to be
their slaves and servants, they created
[SPEAKER_07]: domesticated plants and domesticated
animals to give the gods their needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, whether you believe that or not,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the evidence is there that
somebody was here, whether it was the
[SPEAKER_07]: Anunnaki, as the Sumerians called them,
or somebody else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody, a super culture was here in the
dim past and they left their fingerprints
[SPEAKER_07]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just refuse to acknowledge that their
fingerprints are here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that these people left
us with a legacy of is an explanation for
[SPEAKER_07]: how the earth came to be like this,
the earth itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: All liquid bodies in a vacuum form
themselves into a tight spherical ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've all seen milk get loosened,
space shuttle and all that, and it all
[SPEAKER_07]: forms into a ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what liquids do in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_07]: All other astral bodies that we know of,
except for the meteorites and comets,
[SPEAKER_07]: which are started out as pieces of this
supposedly, and planets explode and things
[SPEAKER_07]: like that, to create the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anything that formed as a viscous
mass, which clearly the earth did,
[SPEAKER_07]: forms in a complete smooth ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened to the earth?
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sumerians have an explanation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our guys are still trying to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's in my book.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in Sitchin's book if you want to find
out more about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Point is, there are some answers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another basic proof of the existence of
these multiple super people, super gods,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever you want to call them,
are megalithic structures around the
[SPEAKER_07]: world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Megalithic structures like these,
if I was standing here, I wish I was in
[SPEAKER_07]: this picture, my head would be about right
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how big they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: High in the mountains above Cusco,
impossible for humans to have put this
[SPEAKER_07]: together, and yet we are told that they
did so.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the same holds true for Tiwanaku,
Teotihuacan, Baalbek in Lebanon,
[SPEAKER_07]: Stonehenge, around the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe megalithic structures we want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Humans somehow did it, because nothing
else is allowed.
[SPEAKER_07]: No outside intervention is permitted.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have to explain it in rational,
natural terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they just say, somehow they did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can't do it today.
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't reproduce this kind of precision
in our work today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right there, that story is over with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right there, that story is a fraud.
[SPEAKER_07]: That story is absurd.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, the Egyptologists will not hear
that it couldn't be nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than that, they weren't just slamming
these things into place.
[SPEAKER_07]: These looked like they were, but still
they were being laid pretty carefully
[SPEAKER_07]: because they were all flattened and they
all worked out such that they went up to
[SPEAKER_07]: the top perfectly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's what's the amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were covered with polished limestone,
each of which was placed to perfection.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it couldn't be any other way,
because if you have mistakes down at the
[SPEAKER_07]: bottom, the size of the postage stamp goes
the size of the car at the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single stone in these three pyramids
had to be perfect, and they were.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank goodness, while they were stripping
off the covering limestone, they left a
[SPEAKER_07]: few down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see how marvelous the
workmanship was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a connecting line between two of
the stones.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the width of a human hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: See it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Coin, connecting line right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot, in our wildest dreams,
put stones together with this kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in our wildest dreams can we do this
on a massive scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Rolex watch, folks, built to the
size of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Impossible today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet somehow these primitive people did
it using ropes and stone tools and wood
[SPEAKER_07]: rollers to do the stones, wood they did
not have and don't grow in the Nile
[SPEAKER_07]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_07]: They would have had to import them from
Lebanon, which back then, 3,500 years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: would have been a tough effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sphinx.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've all seen him too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to look at this wall over here for
a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you've all seen the mystery of the
Sphinx and seen the idea that this is
[SPEAKER_07]: caused by running water.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are running water marks.
[SPEAKER_07]: After the Sphinx was carved out,
the walls were smoothed over and gouged by
[SPEAKER_07]: running water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: That the Sphinx was carved at a minimum of
8,000 to 10,000 years ago before the
[SPEAKER_07]: desiccated in that area.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more likely that it's more like
15,000 to 16,000 years ago to have it
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting there and give enough rain time so
that all this could happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, 15,000 to 16,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: No Egyptologist is going to come up with
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they've had it pretty much crammed
down their throats, so some of them are
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning to say, well, yeah, maybe that
happened, but then the pyramids were still
[SPEAKER_07]: made within that 100-year period.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're trying to very best to get the
Sphinx back on the page and at the same
[SPEAKER_07]: time as the pyramids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: However or whenever it was done,
one thing is for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they cut these stones out of here,
they moved them up here to build two
[SPEAKER_07]: temples, the Sphinx Temple and the Valley
Temple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you see this looking the other way now,
Sphinx here, Sphinx Temple, Valley Temple,
[SPEAKER_07]: you see the size of some of the stones.
[SPEAKER_07]: They too were, by the way, covered with
those perfect polished limes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got stripped off to build buildings
in Cairo, which is just one of the great
[SPEAKER_07]: sins of the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: People doing that, ruining the beauty and
perfection of these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: No less they did in the year before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is me back when I was younger and had
hair and was cool and was a snappy
[SPEAKER_07]: dresser.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never had hair and I was never cool and
I'm still not snappy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyhow, this was another guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you see, 170 tons of stone just one
of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the pyramids, a 1500, not that unusual.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the inside, all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: In perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's what it takes to move 170 tons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today.
[SPEAKER_07]: This big pumper right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to move it from where you saw that
drawing out, it would be three or four
[SPEAKER_07]: days to set up each time to move it just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you have to put it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to roll this thing forward and
rebook it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, eight and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight and a half minutes, all you got.
[SPEAKER_07]: To move a 170 ton stone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are stones all over the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Way bigger than 170 tons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my favorites is the ancient 1170
ton obelisk, the unfinished obelisk,
[SPEAKER_07]: it has one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pink granite, one of the hardest stones in
the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cut out obviously with some other stone
that was harder than it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know where they would have gotten
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But nonetheless, they carved it out of
this hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in a hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy that's taking pictures up on land
and there's the edge of the record.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 15 feet deep in a hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, as you can see, it's been worked
and polished and it's pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just finishing off the spire
and something is digging out pink granite
[SPEAKER_07]: in chunks the size of the seats that
you're sitting in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some big machine just gouging.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as that machine presses down,
it cracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It finds a fault and it cracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those building it with that machine
just said, oops, we broke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They unhook it off the nose and they go
away and they just leave it for us to
[SPEAKER_07]: marvel at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now understand, they fixed a bunch of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it did a bunch of them perfectly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got huge gigantic obelisks around
Egypt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they got stolen and taken to
other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's this one, which is every size.
[SPEAKER_07]: Problem, problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you get it out of the hole?
[SPEAKER_07]: Better yet, even bigger problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you cut it loose from its base?
[SPEAKER_07]: With the finest drill we have today
covered in diamonds, you could not make it
[SPEAKER_07]: go through there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The weight would press it down and
compress it and not let it go.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did these primitive people cut this
stone, which is very much loose?
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the scientists, according to
the Egyptologists, some poor schmuck got
[SPEAKER_07]: down there with his little stone axes and
went to hammer it and somehow worked his
[SPEAKER_07]: way all the way through the underneath and
worked their way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They would have been crushed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's just no physical way to do
this, folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: None.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you could, if you could somehow do
it, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what it would take to move only
1,000 times.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't get much bigger than this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, you have stones in Baalbek,
Baalbek, Lebanon, that are 2,000 times.
[SPEAKER_07]: 2,000 times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet there they sit up in a wall,
higher than a wall, in the temple of
[SPEAKER_07]: Baalbek.
[SPEAKER_07]: Primitive people did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like the hominoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: How?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they liked to.
[SPEAKER_07]: No intervention is allowed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you laughing or are you coughing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Coughing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: You okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: You need some water?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's true, next slide, then they
weren't, if they were here, we have other
[SPEAKER_07]: evidence to show that they were.
[SPEAKER_07]: The, as I said earlier, domestication of
plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the story we're told now is that all
domesticated plants and animals,
[SPEAKER_07]: and pretty much seems to be this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: All domesticated plants and animals come
in a period from 10,000 years ago to 5,000
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: 10,000 years ago to 5,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had none since, really, that amount
to anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: The big, big, big ones, the sheep,
the cattle, the goats, the corn,
[SPEAKER_07]: the maize.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the corn, wheat, barley,
all that came within that period.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stuff we really use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, how is that explained?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in terms of plants, it's explained
this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somehow, these Stone Age people looked out
of the cave one day, and one of them got
[SPEAKER_07]: the bright idea that, hey, if we pull up
some of these grasses and grains and
[SPEAKER_07]: cereals that we're looking at,
which are out there today, look at them
[SPEAKER_07]: today and see, with their little bitty,
tiny, tiny seeds that are the size of
[SPEAKER_07]: pepper flakes or salt crystals,
and hard as sardine salt crystals,
[SPEAKER_07]: and biochemically only suited to feeding
grazing animals, this Stone Age wizard got
[SPEAKER_07]: the idea, hey, if we pick through those
little pepper flakes and salt crystals and
[SPEAKER_07]: pick out the biggest ones, and they're
marginally bigger than the others,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we plant them, figuring out how to
plant and grow, and plant them and make
[SPEAKER_07]: them produce crops, and then we pick out
the biggest ones of that and let them
produce crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over a couple of thousand years or more,
over a couple thousand years or more,
[SPEAKER_07]: those little bitty pepper flakes,
salt crystal seeds will grow into
[SPEAKER_07]: something we can actually use,
you know, see easily and use in our hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will soften.
[SPEAKER_07]: The seeds will soften and turn from rocks
into something that we can actually cook
[SPEAKER_07]: and eat, and the biochemistry of them will
change.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that they're not suitable for animals
anymore, but they're suitable for us,
[SPEAKER_07]: that our bodies can use them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Won't that be cool?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that cave guy supposedly talked all
his buddies into doing this, and doing it
[SPEAKER_07]: for generation after generation after
generation after generation, planting,
[SPEAKER_07]: sowing, and picking out the best,
and somehow doing this, something we can't
[SPEAKER_07]: do today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not been able to do and reproduce today,
but somehow, this genius did it,
[SPEAKER_07]: and not only that, multiple geniuses did
it because this was done all over the
[SPEAKER_07]: world in different places at different
times within that 5,000-year window.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get things that go from being
these wild, hardy grasses like teosinte
[SPEAKER_07]: into, from this to corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you go from this hardy little
perennial that can just grow anywhere
[SPEAKER_07]: anytime, doesn't need any help,
they grow, to this, which is built with
[SPEAKER_07]: genetic defects, and riddled to the point
where it can't live by itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Without human intervention, corn as we
know it, not, it won't grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't matter, we need it, we use it,
we're happy to have it, but it is clearly
[SPEAKER_07]: not a natural, not a natural species of
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is natural, this is very natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with wheat and emmer,
early wheat and emmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same process, where you go from these
little tiny grass-like things into a much
[SPEAKER_07]: bigger seed, a much plumper seed,
softer seed, and its biochemistry changes
[SPEAKER_07]: from feeding animals to feeding us.
[SPEAKER_07]: These stone-age geniuses somehow pulled
that off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And more than that, next slide,
what they had to do with every one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: domesticated plants that they were going
to turn into grains and cereals and grass
[SPEAKER_07]: that they were going to turn into food,
they had to solve the problem of raches
[SPEAKER_07]: and blooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, blooms are the husks that wrap around
the seeds, and raches are this area right
[SPEAKER_07]: here where they break off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in the wild, raches and blooms have a
cycle where they're pretty tough when the
[SPEAKER_07]: seed is growing, to hold it on to the stem
during windstorms and rain and all that,
[SPEAKER_07]: but as it matures and when it matures,
they turn incredibly brittle so that the
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds can propagate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you pick up a dandelion and it's
gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the raches letting go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Raches and blooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: The seed popping out of the bloom,
the raches letting it go.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how wild things are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if the raches and blooms stayed the
same, it didn't matter how big it got,
[SPEAKER_07]: you couldn't harvest it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when it ripened, what would
happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you hit it with a scythe, every one of
the seeds would drop on the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't collect them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somehow, the raches had to, I mean,
the blooms had to be made and strengthened
[SPEAKER_07]: past the period of ripening so that they
would hold together during harvesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somehow, the raches had to do the same
thing, but the raches had to be set so
[SPEAKER_07]: that when you harvested it and got it back
to where you wanted to thrash it and get
[SPEAKER_07]: the seeds out, in the thrashing process,
the raches had no one to let go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had to be precise for every single
seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single cereal, grass, and grain that
was domesticated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in addition to the biochemistry and the
change in the size of the soil,
[SPEAKER_07]: you had to solve these two problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each one was different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each one had to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: As perfect as the stones of the period.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's impossible to accept that
humans could have done this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with the animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except it's different.
Instead of making little bitty seeds
bigger and softer and all that,
[SPEAKER_07]: they took big, tough, bad news animals and
shrunk them down and made them gentle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gentle their spirits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Changed them psychologically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Changed their brains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wild goats domesticated cattle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wild barks cattle domesticated cattle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shrunk them down and made them docile and
made them domestic so that they could
[SPEAKER_07]: serve man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gives the gods their ease, as it says in
the Sumerian texts.
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with pigs.
[SPEAKER_07]: From wild boar to domesticated pig.
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine bringing this up for the first
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: What they say is, of course, the farmers
that were growing those, domesticating the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants were at the same time domesticating
the animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And no one had the right idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take these wild, bad news animals,
bring them in, live with them,
[SPEAKER_07]: gentle them down over generations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And turn them into things we can use way
downstream from our lives.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely absurd.
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine the first guy bringing anything
wild in.
[SPEAKER_07]: These big orcs, cattle, bad news,
wolves, turn them into dogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just didn't gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cheetah, the king of domestication.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, if nothing else proves that this
does, that genetic engineering took place
[SPEAKER_07]: in the distant past.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cheetah is a hunting cat, a cat
designed to hunt at a very high level of
[SPEAKER_07]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that cats aren't good hunters,
but nothing is like this cheetah on the
[SPEAKER_07]: savanna.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the fastest animal in the world by
far, 70 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: 70 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good racehorse will run 40 top speed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, not only that, it is designed to
hunt.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a different aerodynamically
designed body, more like a greyhound than
[SPEAKER_07]: a true cat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how heavy lions and tigers and
all the hunting cats are.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is slimmed down like a dog,
like a greyhound.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than that, it's got a different
attitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have a cat attitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the very first domesticated
animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have records of it going back almost to
10,000 years ago in Asia, India,
[SPEAKER_07]: and Africa.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very widespread.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tame.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pharaohs used to hunt with these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were hunting at animals designed for
that purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: There has never been a report of a cheetah
attacking and killing a human.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have dog mentality and cat bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have dog-like bodies in the sense
that the bones are much lighter,
[SPEAKER_07]: the lungs have been modified, the
breathing rate has been modified like no
[SPEAKER_07]: other dog, no other cat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But more importantly than that,
get this, they have dog feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: With cat feet, soft pads, and retractable
claws, you can't make a turn at 70 miles
[SPEAKER_07]: an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with a dog foot, a thick, heavy pad,
and permanently extended claws,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're running on track shoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can turn at 70 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cheetah among all cats has dog feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than that, you see this brown fur?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's short-haired dog fur.
[SPEAKER_07]: See those black spots?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cat fur.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheetahs sit like a dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: They get dog-only diseases.
[SPEAKER_07]: They get cat-only diseases.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as if that isn't bizarre enough about
cheetahs, guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: They all have the same DNA, the same
chromosome package.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can take a cheetah from Africa,
and you can take a cheetah from Asia.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can strip their skin off of them and
swap the skin, and it will heal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can trade hearts, no rejection.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when faced with this evidence,
what do you think the Darwinists and the
[SPEAKER_07]: geneticists and the scientists said?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think they came up with?
[SPEAKER_07]: There had to be an answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: There had to be a natural answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they came up with one.
[SPEAKER_07]: These cheetahs got squeezed through a
bottleneck, a genetic bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somehow, somehow, before 10,000 years ago,
every cheetah on Earth in Asia,
[SPEAKER_07]: India, Africa, all of them died except for
one breeding pair or just a couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they repopulated from those.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they all have the same genes,
because they came from the same two
[SPEAKER_07]: original ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that plausible?
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't that make sense?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just an excuse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, it's taught its preaches to
believe like everything else they put out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's garbage.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you're looking at somebody else who
got put through a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got put through a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody in this room has been put
through the same kind of bottleneck that
[SPEAKER_07]: the cheetahs were put through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in 1987, as you see here,
Newsweek magazine, it was found by a study
[SPEAKER_07]: of mitochondrial DNA of women around the
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Women produce and carry mitochondrial DNA
for when we all have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was happened that we don't pass it
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It passes on through the eggs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they did a study of women around the
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they found that we did not,
in fact, descend from any creatures four
[SPEAKER_07]: million years ago, which is what they went
into the experiment looking to prove was
[SPEAKER_07]: closer to five or eight or, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: When did we really separate from our last
common ancestor with the apes,
[SPEAKER_07]: as was believed at the time?
[SPEAKER_07]: They found that the oldest of us,
the oldest of us were only about 200,000
[SPEAKER_07]: years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: 200,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not millions of years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were like brand new, a brand new
species, which matches up pretty well with
[SPEAKER_07]: the Cro-Bagnons at 120,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: If our mitochondrial DNA says we're only
between 150 and 200,000 years old,
[SPEAKER_07]: that matches up pretty well with when our
fossils begin to appear.
[SPEAKER_07]: And furthermore, the oldest of us come
from Southern Africa, making Abadie black.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can imagine how this went over in the
south of the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: But nonetheless, that's the way it would
be.
[SPEAKER_07]: The oldest of us come from Southern
Africa.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we only start up as a species around
150,000 to 200,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the cheetahs.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of us got wiped out, and you know that
we have Homo erectus all over India and
[SPEAKER_07]: China, in Asia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Africa.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those got wiped out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones that were gonna become us,
leaving only a couple, or a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: pairs, to produce us within the last
200,000 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same bottom line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same kind of story that worked with the
cheetah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They expected to work with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: People just can't buy that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are supposedly descended from primates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yet, all of this about us is not the
same.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the same bones, same
muscles, same skin, same adipose tissue,
[SPEAKER_07]: same body hair, patterns, head hair and
nails are different, skulls and brains are
[SPEAKER_07]: different, locomotion is different,
speech is different, sex is different,
[SPEAKER_07]: genetic disorders.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have over 4,000 genetic disorders,
folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: How would we get over 4,000 genetic
disorders working the whole gene pool in
[SPEAKER_07]: only a couple hundred thousand years?
[SPEAKER_07]: When you consider that at least two dozen
of them, by 24 or 25, killed you dead
[SPEAKER_07]: before you reached the age of maturity,
before you can pass that on, before you
[SPEAKER_07]: can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does a disorder like that get into the
whole gene pool?
[SPEAKER_07]: How can you find it among Eskimos and
Matuses?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only one way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were put there, put there,
just like the corn's genetic disorders,
[SPEAKER_07]: just like other domesticated plants and
domesticated animals and genetic disorders
[SPEAKER_07]: were put there because they were the
result of cutting and splicing in a lab as
[SPEAKER_07]: they were being put together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mistakes get made.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the only way you get that many
genetic disorders and genetic disorders
[SPEAKER_07]: that kill you before you can reproduce.
[SPEAKER_07]: But most importantly, our chromosome
package has been reduced from 48
[SPEAKER_07]: chromosomes with all other primates to 46.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we go to be so much better,
supposedly, while losing two full
[SPEAKER_07]: chromosomes?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: How could that happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we look and we see a comparison of
humanship grilled in a rain tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see that, as you've heard,
there's a lot of similarities,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of similarities between us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they use this as an argument to
say, well, it's clear that we evolved from
[SPEAKER_07]: them because our gene package is so close.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only that funny little change from 48
chromosomes to 46, a little bump in the
[SPEAKER_07]: road.
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, it's clear to see that we
evolved from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's look at that change.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we see an M, it just so happens,
a second and third chromosome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the chimp and the gorilla and the rain
tank, they're separate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with us, look, they've been fused.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fused, two genes fused.
[SPEAKER_07]: This doesn't happen in nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's only done in a lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't see that anywhere else but in a
lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you don't see the cheetah's
chromosomal similarity anywhere but in a
[SPEAKER_07]: lab, a genetics lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lab rats, clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: We, just like Darwin said, are
domesticated animals created to serve a
[SPEAKER_07]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five, the super race, whoever you want to
call them, who were here and who built the
[SPEAKER_07]: pyramids and who created the domesticated
plants and who created the domesticated
[SPEAKER_07]: animals, they created us.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the star child skull, the entry
for any of these questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: The star child was composed of undeniably
mammalian bone with the major human
[SPEAKER_07]: components evident.
[SPEAKER_07]: Front of bone, sphenoid, temporal,
rival, and occipital back here.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, each part is profoundly
redesigned with the bone itself
[SPEAKER_07]: astonishingly reconstituted into something
uniformly less that one half as thick as
[SPEAKER_07]: normal weighing one half as much as it
should.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels kind of like a dry board in your
hand, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, the model is the same
weight, so you'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: A real human skull.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see how thin that bone is there?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like that all over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weighs half as much, half as thin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uniform.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking 30 points of reference on it,
point, point, point, point, 30 points of
[SPEAKER_07]: reference on it, and comparing them to the
average of those same 30 points on 100
[SPEAKER_07]: normal skulls, the result calls 10
standard deviations from statistical norm
[SPEAKER_07]: off the chart.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next slide suggests but do not yet
prove that the star child is from a being
[SPEAKER_07]: other than a normal human.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is significant, folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we see in comparison of the two
skulls that were found is that they're
[SPEAKER_07]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now let me give you the background on how
they were found.
[SPEAKER_07]: About 1930, a woman, a young girl,
about 15 years old of Mexican heritage was
[SPEAKER_07]: taken by her parents to visit the old
family homestead in a small village about
[SPEAKER_07]: 100 miles southwest of Chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not know exactly where that village
was, so we can't just run back there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think we can find it, but we don't know
it at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: There it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at that village, she was told not to
go into the caves and the mine tunnels in
[SPEAKER_07]: the area.
[SPEAKER_07]: That, number one, it was dangerous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, it was just forbidden.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was taboo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell most any teenager anywhere what not
to do and, you know, they want to find a
[SPEAKER_07]: way to try to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she snuck off and went exploring.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she went into a mine tunnel and she
found a human skeleton lying on its back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she got close to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: She noticed that there was what she called
a misshapen hand coming up out of the dirt
[SPEAKER_07]: beside that skeleton lying on the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that hand was wrapped around the upper
arm bottom of the human skeleton.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she noticed as she got even closer
that the dirt was all crumbling and loose
[SPEAKER_07]: beside the skeleton and over that hand
that was coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So using her own hands, and this bears out
because in a mine tunnel there would have
[SPEAKER_07]: been no rain, there would have been no
impacting in the soil, and it would have
[SPEAKER_07]: been as loose as the day that the grave
was dug, which we know from carbon 14
[SPEAKER_07]: testing of both these skulls was 900 years
ago plus or minus four years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both skulls tested out that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're pretty likely that this story is
true.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with her own hands she dug out and she
found the full skeleton there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she said that it was smaller than the
human.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the human is about five foot tall
female.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the skeleton would have been about four
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that it had a misshapen body.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all she said because she didn't
know that some years after her death it
[SPEAKER_07]: would be important.
[SPEAKER_07]: But she from the age of 15 she smuggled
the two skulls, not the full skeleton,
[SPEAKER_07]: she has the two skulls, back to the
states, shellacked both skulls on the
[SPEAKER_07]: outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see that shine is from shellac.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put them in a cardboard box and just kept
them until it came time for her to die the
[SPEAKER_07]: early 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she willed them to another couple,
friends of hers, and they put that box in
[SPEAKER_07]: their garage and kept it for five years,
but it didn't light two skulls in a
[SPEAKER_07]: cardboard box in their garage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said the wife said find some way
else.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had a younger couple that they
knew that were UFO knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were into UFO stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they showed them this skull.
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed them both skulls.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said would you like to have one when
they saw this one?
[SPEAKER_07]: They said boy that looks like it could go
in the head of a birdie doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's, we'll take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they contacted me because of my work
in human origins that you saw,
[SPEAKER_07]: I was already known for my work with
skulls and bones already.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they contacted me and they said could
you take this and get it tested by
[SPEAKER_07]: scientists to find out what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said yeah sure, this is so cool,
this is so unique, this is so different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean an idiot could see that surely
scientists will jump all over this and
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll have this tested out probably within
about six months or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which could have been the case if
scientists were really scientists
[SPEAKER_07]: interested in finding out the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're interested in keeping their peers
off their necks and covering their eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We anticipated it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now here we are six months down the
road with answers, we will be.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, it's a visual performance by
everybody involved including myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know how to do that glad
handing kind of thing that fundraisers do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just put it out there and tell people
here's what we need, here's why we need
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I expect them to cough it up and they
never do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it turns out that in the states at
least, the UFO community is very social.
[SPEAKER_07]: They like the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want the game over with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all say they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all say they want answers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you present them with something that
might provide answers, might really
[SPEAKER_07]: absolutely convince everybody that this is
a real phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they skitter the other way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want the party to be over.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I found to be the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can argue with that if you want to,
but that's my experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a social thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't want it over with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they don't want to support it very
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I'm talking to you almost
six years later.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're still struggling.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for one woman it would be over with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this would be back at, you know,
a clock somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for one woman anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now when you look at the two things,
that's the back story.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it all came to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you look at two things, the first
thing you notice, obviously, is the eye
[SPEAKER_07]: sockets.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I stick my finger in a human eye
socket, any of you, yours, mine,
[SPEAKER_07]: anybody's, it'll go about that deep,
about two inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our eye sockets are deeper and bigger than
you suspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put them in the star child as you'll see
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll go maybe up to there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not quite an inch at its deepest point.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you notice, the optic frame is where
the optic nerve and the blood vessels and
[SPEAKER_07]: all come into.
[SPEAKER_07]: The back, the center of the cone in the
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: They then push down at the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_07]: If this thing has eyes like we do,
they're sitting about right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rather than back in deep like ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it has eyes like we do,
because it's so shallow, they're sticking
[SPEAKER_07]: off the face like frog eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a very dangerous position for a kid
growing up just doing the normal things
[SPEAKER_07]: that kids do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can pop right out of their head.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe it doesn't even have eyes quite
like we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one thing significant about it is,
when you take this to anybody,
[SPEAKER_07]: any specialist that will say anything
about it, they'll say, well, it looks
[SPEAKER_07]: like, I mean, it doesn't look like it's
got to be this Bigfoot can't be real and
[SPEAKER_07]: the cheetah and all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to be, got to be some kind of
genetic or birth defect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Genetic defect and birth defect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's the only two possibilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, let's look at it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Genetic defect.
[SPEAKER_07]: No genetic defect produces anything
approaching this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've looked at every manual, every book,
every thing we can find.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not just me, we have a craniofacial
plastic surgeon named Ted Robinson in
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada who spent six weeks trying to find
anything similar to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't find a genetic defect that produces
anything like these effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: So eliminate genetic defects.
[SPEAKER_07]: You take it to any specialist and they'll
all say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That birth defects, one time only,
sperm, egg, misc and eggs are capable of
[SPEAKER_07]: producing anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely anything is possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like this huge big garbage bin
where they can dump anything they don't
[SPEAKER_07]: want to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Birth defect.
[SPEAKER_07]: One time only, sperm, egg, misc and egg.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in fact, there are rules to that game.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sperm, egg, misc and eggs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is ugly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is asymmetrical.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is all-encompassing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is all-encompassing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you can have something born
completely without a head.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have something born completely
without a brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard of those, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But normally, they don't live.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're dead out of the chute.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing lived and lived apparently for
quite some time, as it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, 900 years ago, plus or minus 40
years, you were born in a primitive,
[SPEAKER_07]: isolated village in Mexico and you had one
thing wrong with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a cleft palate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might make it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had two things wrong with your face
and your head.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were now skating on thin ice.
[SPEAKER_07]: They might choose not to keep you and
start over.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were born with three things wrong with
your head.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were done for.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were a faulty copy and you were gotten
rid of.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another reason why we don't have
4,000 genetic disorders in a natural way,
[SPEAKER_07]: because nature weeds out the defects.
[SPEAKER_07]: All animals, parents, get rid of the
faulty copies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Humans did that, too, only until recent
times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Infanticide was not a problem in the old
days.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had a faulty copy, you got rid of
it and you started over, because babies
[SPEAKER_07]: were just, they came, just came.
[SPEAKER_07]: You with me?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that being the case, one would have to
argue that something with everything wrong
[SPEAKER_07]: with its head, everything, there's nothing
right about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing the same except the parts would
not have been kept, would not have been
[SPEAKER_07]: allowed to live, couldn't have lived,
and then it did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only that, it is symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not asymmetrical.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not ugly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not lopsided, like any other break
defect that you see.
[SPEAKER_07]: The skeleton of it, if you see it,
it's wonderfully well put together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's put together differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Its genes told it to grow in a completely
different way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Furthermore, it's so subtle, it's so
subtle that it's symmetry that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: look at these eyes pockets and you can
look at the copy and see.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at it and you cannot see
anything other than a nice, nice smooth
[SPEAKER_07]: scoop in both of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your eyes see nothing but smoothness,
but yet you put your fingers, your fingers
[SPEAKER_07]: are much more symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can put your fingers in here,
you can feel a dent right here,
[SPEAKER_07]: right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drag your finger at this angle right here,
you'll feel a little rise right in here,
[SPEAKER_07]: right in here, and you'll sit back down
into another little dent right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: No possibility that that is a defect
causing this to look this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Its genes told it to grow this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Its genes told it to grow this way because
its genes are not human.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the way humans look.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the thickness of human bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not the weight of human bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in here, you can see it right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pictures aren't always revealing of
everything, but the optic nerve holes are
[SPEAKER_07]: in fact there, both of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're there, little round holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not as clear on the model as they
are in the real one.
[SPEAKER_07]: The nose is broken off.
[SPEAKER_07]: The face, this is just broken off here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lower part of the face is broken off,
but it was there at one time and we have a
[SPEAKER_07]: piece of maxilla that we'll see later.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you just wait, probably most of your
questions will be covered as we go
[SPEAKER_07]: through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a point that needs to be made and
the gentleman has pointed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a normal human skull, the cheekbone
wraps around here and as you see,
[SPEAKER_07]: it wraps in and forms part of the orbit of
the eye.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: See how it folds in and there's no line of
demarcation and this line here comes down
[SPEAKER_07]: through here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see that orbit?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a rounded piece of bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, not so.
[SPEAKER_07]: It snaps off clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: A pretty major difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know how this happens here
because that could not happen there,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's just one of many, many
differences that you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good point and thank you for bringing that
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we see a side view.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the same parts of the bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this human skull was created.
[SPEAKER_07]: You take this to experts and they'll say,
oh, it's a cradle boarded hydrocephalic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first thing that pops out of
most of their mouths.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hydrocephalic because the head,
the cranium is swollen relative to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Swollen in this shape.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydrocephalic meaning water on the brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cradle boarded because of the flatness of
the rear of the head and that's all they
[SPEAKER_07]: want to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you start beginning to give them
arguments about why it's not hydrocephalic
[SPEAKER_07]: or it's not cradle boarded.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're showing you the door.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have made their statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have explained it in their terms,
in natural terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cradle boarded hydrocephalic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I had the late Stephen Jay Gould
himself, the man, the number one guy do
[SPEAKER_07]: that to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cradle boarded hydrocephalic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of us to Google it's not for this
reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Standard response.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the sea, there's a cradle boarded skull
right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, cradle boarding is very common in
primitive cultures.
[SPEAKER_07]: What it is is mother has a baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got to go to work in three or four
days, back to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need her hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she's got to strap her baby onto her
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she is stooping and bending and
stooping and bending, she can't have the
[SPEAKER_07]: baby's head lolling around like that
because it will snap its neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she has to tie the baby's head to a
board to keep it on her back so she can
[SPEAKER_07]: work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, again, very common.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you get because the baby's bones are
so soft is the back of the head that comes
[SPEAKER_07]: out as flat as the board you put it on,
as flat as that table.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you feel the back of her head,
it is as flat as a board.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no bumps at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: You feel the back of this head.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can feel it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you feel the subtle convolutions of
the bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was never cradle-boarded.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never cradle-boarded.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not a hydrophilic because,
as you'll see in a moment, there's a ridge
[SPEAKER_07]: down the middle of here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there was pressure from pushing,
from the inside of the brain pushing out,
[SPEAKER_07]: that crease would not be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not cradle-boarded.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, when a skull is cradle-boarded,
the cradle boarding always stops at the
[SPEAKER_07]: knot at the rear of the head called the
external occipital protuberance of a
[SPEAKER_07]: union.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reach around, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: You feel that knot in the back of your
center of your head, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: How did I do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody has that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a knot, and your neck starts right
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were cradle-boarded as an infant,
it stops there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes from the crown up here to there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the size of the palm of my
hand, the area that gets flattened.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't go past the union because
you're tearing into the neck muscles if
[SPEAKER_07]: you do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing has no union at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a damage, you'll see in a moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this neck doesn't start to go down
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a very small neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: This neck starts up here and covers all
this area here.
[SPEAKER_07]: See those lines just to show that it's
balanced when I'm trying to fudge it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you go back a little bit?
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, ear hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ear hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheekbone.
[SPEAKER_07]: See this little nub right here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheekbone that would come up and attach
here where it's torn off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get two fingers up through here.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the real skull, my two fingers fit very
easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Up through here, a couple of solar straws
will fit through here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The chewing muscles that come up and
attach, chewing muscles, they come up
[SPEAKER_07]: through here, go up through here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This whole area right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see it clearer in another person
coming up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chewing muscles cover this whole area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sore child, you come up through here,
come down through here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much, much reduced to chewing muscles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much smaller lower face.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I say reduced, I don't mean
they're going to grow as it gets older.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're born with them fitting up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing was born with them fitting down
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Born different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neck, all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neck completely reconfigured like
everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rear of the head.
[SPEAKER_07]: The sutures, you know about sutures,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: A baby's born with all this wide open with
ligaments in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little patches of bone so that the head
can shape to fit through the birth canal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over the next two years or so,
these sutures close up and the last one
[SPEAKER_07]: closes up here at the top, the soft spot
where the three of them come together.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, it looks like the occipital
here, this occipital, has been just
[SPEAKER_07]: stretched out and flattened.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the crease down the middle
here, the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: This area here, which is now a dent,
is where the end should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right here, it's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you see the neck muscles attaching and
going through here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big, big fossil where the neck muscles are
attaching them through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you see they don't attach till down
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: About an inch below where they should.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the neck is a much, much smaller,
much reduced neck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like a much reduced face.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the crown, again, completely different
relative to where it should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: These bones here are called laryngal
bones.
[SPEAKER_07]: These indicate that it's more than four
and a half, five years old.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up in teens, maybe even 20s.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily a child, but there's a lot
of debate on how old it was when it died
[SPEAKER_07]: because its teeth looked very childlike.
[SPEAKER_07]: The top of the head is showing one of the
differences.
[SPEAKER_07]: The staining, by the way, on the star
child that you saw on its cheek is from
[SPEAKER_07]: the fact that it was buried in the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And probably picked up some staining from
being buried.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we see the underside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this bone right here, the basal part,
the basal part, is missing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This bone fuses in all of its body around
the age of 25.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one was post 25, this female,
when she died.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that died with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, we first thought initially
that it was its mother, maybe,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that her baby died.
[SPEAKER_07]: She married it, because that's clearly a
death and a suicide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she laid down to die with it,
wrapped its arm around her arm,
[SPEAKER_07]: cut her throat to poison, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: She laid down with her to die with this
child that had died, or this being that
[SPEAKER_07]: had died, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we originally thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we know, because of genetic testing,
she was not its mother.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not genetically related.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were husband and wife.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were caretakers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were a child and lovers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know them to what.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had enough commitment to it,
to bury it when it died, and kill herself,
[SPEAKER_07]: take her own life, to be there with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, so she was in her 30s.
[SPEAKER_07]: Her teeth are flattened down like horse
teeth.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the cusps all worn away,
but that's eating a very gritty diet of
[SPEAKER_07]: corn grit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 30s is a good age, probably,
for her, and it has.
[SPEAKER_07]: With this, we're not as sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything here is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the condyles, how much smaller
relative to these.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the mandibular fossa right here,
as opposed to the size of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're just looking at a much reduced
golden face here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This indicates a death, age of death of
less than 25, if indeed aged the way we
[SPEAKER_07]: would.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an x-ray of the two children and
you see the human eye sockets and the
[SPEAKER_07]: frontal sinuses of the human.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look like hollowed out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you see with the store child,
completely no fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even vestigial, not even nose,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing didn't have sinuses at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very meaningful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And notice if you will, look at the normal
eye sockets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at these kind of, this flare thing
over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that weird?
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what it means, but that's
how it came out of the x-ray.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also notice if you will, how the brain
kind of looks like this fills up solid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have here kind of a brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know what that means either.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we have some real strong proof
against hypercephaly from the outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the veins.
[SPEAKER_07]: The brain presses up into the bone,
and because the bone is soft, and this is
[SPEAKER_07]: from when you're a baby, bone is soft,
the veins make dents in your bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bone kind of wraps around the veins and
you see the tracts going all the way up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you see the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the tracts going up all the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you see this bulge in the
parietal that you don't have.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the same area here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much more parietal.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the area, by the way,
that was a little extended in Einstein to
[SPEAKER_07]: make hemorrhages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looked a little bigger than hemorrhages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes you wonder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: The teeth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we have the little piece of maxilla,
upper right maxilla.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is this piece of bone right here from
the middle of your upper jaw around to the
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the size, forget how it looks
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real small and it's basically the
size of a child.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the nose opening for, so it had a
breathing capacity like we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are the two teeth over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This tooth has been lost in DNA testing
unsuccessfully, of course, for the first
[SPEAKER_07]: time around.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at these holes here,
you can see other teeth come out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you x-ray this and you see four teeth
up in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty clear that it has a child's
dentition and that's why we call it the
[SPEAKER_07]: star child emission.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were told, well, it's got teeth down,
teeth up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's small, it's weird, it's a child.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we call it the star child for a very
long time before we began to really wonder
[SPEAKER_07]: if the wormy and bone issue might indicate
that it was older than the child.
[SPEAKER_07]: We still don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: We take a close-up of the remaining tooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you see is a lot of wear on the
enamel, shearing across the enamel up to
[SPEAKER_07]: that point right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see pitting of the pit here and here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you see this crack here, this is
called bracing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like an adult tooth repair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seen in what seems to be about a four and
a half, five-year-old child.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hard to figure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now it gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we cut some bone to do some DNA
testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carina was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it was cut, two things happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: The geneticists who had dealt with it
cutting bone for quite some time and knew
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot about it said, ooh, boy,
this is, with the dremel blades,
boy, this is tough to cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is much tougher than it should be for
such thin bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Such thin-like bone, you'd think it just
cracked through like an egg shell.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was resistant to the dremel blade.
[SPEAKER_07]: The dremel blade being a circular blade
and rolls on a little thing like that,
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of like a flashlight, like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so, and now like that, it produced a
profound smell of burning tooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you get your teeth drilled,
that smell everybody recognizes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not enamel.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's collagen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is collagen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that until fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: That smell is burning collagen,
not enamel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bone is made of two things, hydroxy,
calcium hydroxyapatite or appetite and
[SPEAKER_07]: collagen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enamel is distinctive for tooth,
so that is burning collagen that you
[SPEAKER_07]: smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Strong smell of collagen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were surprised by those two things,
but the hardest issue was the one that got
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, you want to have this tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the DNA proved, first time proved,
they took the bone like this, a piece like
[SPEAKER_07]: this, and they put it in the normal
dissolving fluid, which is called EDTA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And EDTA is just a dissolver that you take
normal bone and it'll dissolve it away in
[SPEAKER_07]: about a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they go to work on taking away
everything except the DNA and do the DNA
[SPEAKER_07]: testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: About a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said, well, it's so thin and so
different, so like, you know, it's
[SPEAKER_07]: probably going to be three days,
maybe four days, and EDTA will dissolve it
[SPEAKER_07]: in the start.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten weeks later, it looked the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten weeks later, it looked the same and
did not dissolve at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said, we're going to put a
detergent in it called Tween 20,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's pretty strong, and that should
take it down, should take at least some of
[SPEAKER_07]: it down so we can work with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They put the Tween 20 in it, poof,
gone, overnight, gone, gone, gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely dissolved overnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a surprise, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they used what the liquid was left and
they tested it, and now the mother,
[SPEAKER_07]: her mitochondrial DNA and her nuclear DNA
came up really as a beautiful problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: The assumption being that in 900 years,
being in a mine tunnel, not being rained
[SPEAKER_07]: on, not being dried out, not being
bleached by the sun, all that,
[SPEAKER_07]: it should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: The DNA should be well preserved,
and it was in the human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Starchile, the only difference being it
was buried, its mitochondrial DNA,
[SPEAKER_07]: its mother, part that comes from its
mother, came up beautiful, no problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: The nuclear DNA, which is from the inside
of the nucleus, you know, in a cell,
[SPEAKER_07]: the mitochondrial DNA floats outside the
cell and it's like little chips of stone
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's very durable.
[SPEAKER_07]: The nuclear DNA is the chromosome package
inside the nucleus and it's fairly
[SPEAKER_07]: fragile.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't, for whatever reason,
come up and try it four times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each time the mitochondrial DNA came up
easy, the nuclear DNA did not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, well, there must have been some
kind of weird degradation going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's understandable, buried, might have
been very acidic soil that was buried in,
[SPEAKER_07]: got some staining, so we kind of excused
it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just said, we're gonna have to wait a
while until the primers get more
[SPEAKER_07]: sophisticated to get the nuclear DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we believe nuclear DNA is here because
the mitochondrial DNA is so easy to
[SPEAKER_07]: recover, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said, in the meanwhile,
you should test the bone to see about the
[SPEAKER_07]: chemistry and see why it's so hard to cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's unusual.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm worried too much about the smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: The smell is a secondary to why it's so
hard to cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: So finally, the lady who put up the money
for the DNA testing, she had taken a
[SPEAKER_07]: partner named Grant Singleton.
[SPEAKER_07]: He arranged to have the bone tested with
the scanning electron microscope at the
[SPEAKER_07]: Royal Holloway Scientific Institute in
London, which is a castle, a really big
[SPEAKER_07]: castle that's been converted into a
scientific institute.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the scanning electron microscope,
this is what we saw.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a cortical bone layer,
it's like a sandwich, bone is like a
[SPEAKER_07]: sandwich at this time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cortical layer outside and underneath
and the inside, but it cancels its holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in here is where the marrow goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The marrow moves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bone has, it doesn't have vessels and
things like that, it has its holes and the
[SPEAKER_07]: marrow just kind of moves through the
cancerous holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they looked at the scanning
electron microscope and took the pictures,
[SPEAKER_07]: they saw this, they said, holy smokes,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: These things here, see these?
[SPEAKER_07]: These are not known in bone, regular bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never seen them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna look at a couple of them up
close, but these are just samples of
[SPEAKER_07]: others that you can, that were in many of
the cancerous holes in the storage hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very strange, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna look at that one first.
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like a little thin piece here
that got wrapped up somehow in this,
[SPEAKER_07]: came out here and all this is wrapped
around it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We first saw this, we thought,
boy, it must be some kind of capillary of
[SPEAKER_07]: some kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are no capillaries involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the way bone is set up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This doesn't look the same, it's more like
threads or hairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a piece of, just another area of
the same piece of bone, which by the way
[SPEAKER_07]: is as big as my thumbnail or your
thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a big piece of bone at all,
cut out of the storage hole right up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Use your thumb.
[SPEAKER_07]: The blade was cutting a little too fast
and as it came to the end of the cut,
[SPEAKER_07]: it met up on it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: The speed is, we got a rougher cut here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, just, we're gonna focus on this first
one right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: See what you get?
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at these thread-y-like things
starting to appear.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting closer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: See it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, up to here, up to here, shredded.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this, chips of stuff are just the
bone residue thrown around by the cutting
[SPEAKER_07]: process.
[SPEAKER_07]: You saw it all and you can see it slowly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this little knobby thing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go to there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see this going up?
[SPEAKER_07]: You see it getting up?
[SPEAKER_07]: This, whatever it is, is a different kind
of thing and this is a piece of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's shredded, folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Understand it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It resisted the dremel wave, whatever it
is, stronger than the bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's amazing about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, you see this going up?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the stub thing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes in and disappears into here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another piece growing here that's
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like it fans out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, when we saw this, the experts in
Marietta said, you know, this looks like
[SPEAKER_07]: it might be fungi or bacteria or something
that's grown on the bone since you cut it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we have it tested by mycologists
or at least looked at by mycologists and
[SPEAKER_07]: see what they say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mycologists being specialists in fungi and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: We took it to three in England,
including the very best England hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's mycologist.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, I've never seen anything like
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen this in mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are 30,000 possible examples of
fungi or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I don't know them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we need to have it tested to find out
what it is for sure, which we agree with.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need to have it tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to test how long we talk and tell
us this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fairly sophisticated, fairly expensive,
but it can nail us down one way or the
[SPEAKER_07]: other.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he says, I don't think this is
bacteria or fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like something built at the end
of the line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now what also is weird about it is these
things are high in silicon.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have about 25% silicon in them,
whatever they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see here in the base of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now here's another one that's not out of a
cancellous hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: It probably came from a cancellous hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: It got sheared loose and it ended up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could it come from here?
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: No idea what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now look at this piece here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: See how it is kind of praying mantis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice here it shredded off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tears.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our thought was, well maybe this is
part of what's making it so difficult to
[SPEAKER_07]: cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's some kind of fiber network
that's laid through the bone that keeps it
[SPEAKER_07]: resistant to cutting.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are things we have to find out.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all fairly new.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is about, these are about four months
old and what you're going to see later are
[SPEAKER_07]: about six weeks old.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all new stuff, hot cotton.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're some of the first people to see
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we did after the first scanning
electron microscope, though that was
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little more than half and it just
doesn't fit in the same frame.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is the inside surface of the
human female skull.
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice that this is an encrustation made
up of silicates, sand and dust and grit
[SPEAKER_07]: that is just collected to about a
sixteenth of an inch layer on the inside
[SPEAKER_07]: of the skull.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is normal for 900 years in a high
desert environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the outside of the human female
skull that shines again due to the shellac
[SPEAKER_07]: that was put on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And see these dimples.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is dimpling on the surface of the
skull.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, perfectly normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what you would expect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those dimples would be under the
encrustation if you can see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is the inside surface of the star
child.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you do see the dimples.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very shallow, but you do see them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you notice?
[SPEAKER_07]: No encrustation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it was buried for the same
kind of 900 years, you would expect one
[SPEAKER_07]: that you see, but for some reason you
don't see.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the outer surface of the star
child.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see no dimples at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very strange.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you see a comparison of the two.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the human female inside with the
encrustation in one with respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the outer surface of the human
with the dimpling that is normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the outer surface of the star
child with no dimple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody can see there is a significant
difference between these two.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be, it doesn't matter how
deformed you are, if you're human,
[SPEAKER_07]: the bone will not be human.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would think whatever's left should be
human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now what after that was done,
a guy that we contacted who's a specialist
[SPEAKER_07]: in this said, we're gonna now take the
bone and instead of cut it, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_07]: take the cut piece and we're gonna snap
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna break it along with the human
and the star child and get what are called
[SPEAKER_07]: fractured edges.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're gonna take them and polish
them down with lapidary tools,
[SPEAKER_07]: with the jeweler tools.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna very slowly and very carefully
take it down, flatten it out, and make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure that no crud gets in the cancerous
holes because they were looking to see
[SPEAKER_07]: what causes the toughness and because it
looked like some of the layers of the
[SPEAKER_07]: cortical bone seemed to have a chemical
reading or an enamel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the thought was, well, maybe we can
find some sign in the star child bone of
[SPEAKER_07]: enamel rather than, of layering rather
than what humans have which is sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: like what we're encountering.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the human polished,
one side, the outside, the upper,
[SPEAKER_07]: the outside of the head there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you see, polished, how clean the bone
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know why?
[SPEAKER_07]: When you die, when you die, you carry
within your body the bacteria that are
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna consume you down enough over time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother nature cleans her plate.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she didn't, we'd walk out of here and
there'd be thousand foot high piles of
[SPEAKER_07]: bones out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother nature cleans her plate.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does she do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: She puts in you when you're born the
bacteria that are gonna eat you up when
[SPEAKER_07]: you die.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are bacteria in you that eat
your marrow out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why normal cancerous bone looks
like this, like it's been licked clean
[SPEAKER_07]: because it has.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also normal cancerous bone or normal
human bone looks like alabaster.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful that it's polished and
shined up like this.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how it looks, next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just the other side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the inner layer and that is
the layer of encrustation that you saw
[SPEAKER_07]: flat on a while ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you see a little bit of like layering
here but you see it's very irregular and
[SPEAKER_07]: it goes down kind of like in sheets,
kind of like, again, poor concrete.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, you see how clear the cancerous
hole is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you see the star child and you see
difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of milky.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got thicker banding here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what red now like enablers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could have something to do with
the toughness of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you see the cancerous holes into that
milkiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what the milkiness is from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Collagen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Collagen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember I told you that that smell the
first cut was so stinky bad of bone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Collagen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: This piece of bone, one half is thicker
than it should be, carries the full load
[SPEAKER_07]: of collagen like a compressed computer
file.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know how that much collagen alive
for that matter, how much collagen is
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's clear to see that it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: No shine, there's no alabaster,
it's a creamy milky.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's caused by the added collagen which
we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: But most importantly, you notice anything
at all kind of weird about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Look dead center.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead center.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see this little speck here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Look to your eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see any reddish here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: We missed it the first time through.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't miss this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did the bacteria not eat that away?
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Close up on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be one of two things,
desiccated marrow, which is the most
[SPEAKER_07]: likely thing, or some kind of inorganic
mineral that got left behind somewhere
[SPEAKER_07]: that the bacteria couldn't eat and
couldn't dissolve.
[SPEAKER_07]: Except no such thing is known.
[SPEAKER_07]: No such thing is known.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be in bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So either way you cut it, this is
extremely weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Extremely unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Extremely potentially historical.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if this is desiccated marrow,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what else?
[SPEAKER_07]: The geneticists had it, had it in hand,
and couldn't find nuclear DNA with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's human primers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what does that tell you?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not human DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they were getting the
mitochondrial DNA, but not getting the
[SPEAKER_07]: nuclear DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the primers were going after human
nuclear DNA, and they weren't matching up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now if it's inorganic, which it could be,
if it's inorganic, we still have to find
[SPEAKER_07]: out what it's doing here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it made of?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it doing here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Folks, this is very potentially an
historic thing you're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because even if it's not alien connected,
it's the weirdest human thing that
[SPEAKER_07]: anybody's ever seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: More so than the elephant man.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just beginning to bubble up to the surface
of consciousness around the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in a cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we see a back lip, and this was
flipped, the moment it was flipped,
[SPEAKER_07]: the girl who did the slide setting just
made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the top side of the side.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyhow, the point is, there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at how much there is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just astonishing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, everybody that we've had,
eight major big time scientists,
[SPEAKER_07]: in England, from the Royal Holloway,
look at this, including mycologists,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they all say, gee whiz, we have no
idea what this is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to find out next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the tests that we need,
just some of the tests, most of the major
[SPEAKER_07]: tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a third DNA analysis, which is now
underway, secreting the nuclear DNA,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we assume we're going to get enough
money to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't yet, but we're only going to
test it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a detailed dental analysis,
an enamel surface indication, all the
[SPEAKER_07]: tough tests, as I said earlier,
tests for the bacteria and the fungi,
[SPEAKER_07]: a detailed analysis of the fibers in the
residue, the fibers in the redstone.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they made of?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's making it so hard?
[SPEAKER_07]: Inductively coupled plasma spectrometry
and laser ray spectroscopy for trace
[SPEAKER_07]: elements.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there trace elements in here that
don't belong?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there trace elements of things we
don't have normally on Earth, or things
[SPEAKER_07]: we've never heard of, or combinations that
shouldn't be?
[SPEAKER_07]: Test all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Light elements, stable isotope analysis,
strong and wet isotope ratios.
[SPEAKER_07]: The isotope ratios, analysis, what they
tell you is where the thing lived,
[SPEAKER_07]: what its environment was like,
what it left behind, what its environment
[SPEAKER_07]: was like.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing what they can do with these
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very sophisticated, they're very
expensive, but before they compare,
[SPEAKER_07]: just amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: X-ray power, diffraction, crystal
biochemical, to tell us about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: More scanning electron microscopes,
animations on multiple fracture surfaces,
[SPEAKER_07]: to see more of the fibers, to see more of
the red stuff and try to see what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Transmitted light microscopy for
structural features, again, looking for
[SPEAKER_07]: hardness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Electron probe and or ion probe
conclusions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just stuff they want to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even understand most of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Analyzing crustaceans inside those skulls,
and then visit the recovery area.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it come and take soil samples to
make sure that matches up, to make sure
[SPEAKER_07]: that the soil and crustacean came from
where the skull supposedly came.
[SPEAKER_07]: We assume that they did, and we just
absolutely have to prove it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clay model reconstruction, facial
features, that's something we just kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can use that, but we're going to use
whatever money we get to do the testing
[SPEAKER_07]: first, because that's more important.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have to do, what we've been told
by the scientists, now, is that we are
[SPEAKER_07]: working on something that is so important
that it has to be done at a certain level
[SPEAKER_07]: of sophistication.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of that, this is what has to be
done.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need between $50,000 and $100,000,
probably more like $100,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: Melinda, by the way, Melinda McKenzie,
the lady who put this together,
[SPEAKER_07]: the composites and all that, she put up
50,000 pounds, which is basically
[SPEAKER_07]: $100,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone through that now in the past
two years, doing all the stuff that you've
[SPEAKER_07]: seen with DNA and all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need now to double that over again.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to find somebody with deep
pockets who's willing to, this is not a
[SPEAKER_07]: business deal, this is a scientific
endeavor where we're trying to move the
[SPEAKER_07]: line of history forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not in this to make anybody a bundle
of money, we're in this to answer the same
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of questions as if we had found Lucy,
or the late Tricana boy, or anything like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can go to your college or
university, whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: we do this by the skin of our teeth,
we do it on a budget, but we get it done.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what we need.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been told that because it's so
important when we stand up in front of the
[SPEAKER_07]: world and announce whatever it is that we
have, we're facing that bank of
[SPEAKER_07]: microphones that you always see at a press
conference.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have got to be able to stand there and
say we've covered every base, because you
[SPEAKER_07]: know and I know that the critics are going
to say, have you done this test,
[SPEAKER_07]: have you done that test, have you done
this test, have you done that test?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I have to say no to any of them,
they're going to say, well, what are you
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to hide?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't you?
[SPEAKER_07]: How can we believe you did this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what you say it is if you
didn't do these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're kind of boxed in where we
have to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to do all of it to cover the
bases.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we can do that and make our case,
we've got enough sample, enough bone to
[SPEAKER_07]: where anybody else out there who wants to
criticize what we did can take the sample
[SPEAKER_07]: and repeat the test for themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the beauty of the starchopter,
so much of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes so little to do most of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pieces the size of your fingernails is all
it takes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is what I'm here for, and this is
what I'm asking you for, is help to get
[SPEAKER_07]: this done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't say anybody here is able to do it,
but if you know anybody that is,
[SPEAKER_07]: please contact them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have them go to the website, Starchile-UK
.com and read through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them what you've seen and what you've
heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're the real deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: We handle the money properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do what we're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And trust me, if you don't believe
anything else, believe that I'm not in
[SPEAKER_07]: here for the money or anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want it over with so I can go back
to my world and my life as a human origin.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not my game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want this over with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't keep you any longer with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can clap now if you want to.
[SPEAKER_08]: For those who have stepped forth into the
enigmatic and complicated world of UFO
[SPEAKER_08]: research, they know that it is rife with
the vision.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here, just like religion, we have
another reason for the numerous splits,
[SPEAKER_08]: as the enigma really comes down to the
individual human experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many who have claimed that they
have been visited by aliens or beings from
[SPEAKER_08]: other dimensions.
[SPEAKER_08]: The vast majority, like people who see
ghosts and apparitions, believe in the
[SPEAKER_08]: data from experiences they encountered
with their very own eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The unconscious mind remains a mystery
because we are simply not conscious of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We must imagine what it is like inside
this huge domain on the other side of our
[SPEAKER_08]: daily realities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Occasionally, people recall their
encounters in this strange world,
[SPEAKER_08]: in dreams, and more interestingly,
lucid dreams, whereby we become conscious
[SPEAKER_08]: of elements of our unconscious world and
even interact with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we remain neutral, then we avoid
excluding any possibilities that have yet
[SPEAKER_08]: to emerge in our conscious and unconscious
minds.
[SPEAKER_08]: We avoid putting ourselves into any framed
paradigm, as in the case of science and
[SPEAKER_08]: logic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps we need to abandon any previous
notions or ideas about this phenomenon to
[SPEAKER_08]: gain headway into the unknown.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are the UFOs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they emanating from ourselves?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they here only because we have the
capacity to perceive them?
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps they are ancient archetypes that
we have forgotten within the sands of
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever they are, they are very real to
the experiencer.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are real to countless thousands who
encounter them more and more each year as
[SPEAKER_08]: the sightings continue to multiply.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are they trying to tell us?
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can understand the UFOs,
perhaps we can better understand
[SPEAKER_08]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: The real Fox Mulder is free of the demands
placed upon him by government.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are his opinions on ancient
astronauts, black technology, and the
[SPEAKER_08]: psychology of belief in UFOs?
[SPEAKER_08]: And last, but not least, aliens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our world, all the other world,
all the planets, all the universes,
[SPEAKER_03]: parallel universes, whatever there may be,
every blade of grass, every animal is
[SPEAKER_03]: interconnected in some way, shape,
or form.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some say the end of mankind is near.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some say that economic and financial
turmoil is part of the process,
[SPEAKER_08]: along with global warming, warfare,
and the spread of mass psychosis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Children are prescribed drugs to keep them
calm.
[SPEAKER_08]: The climate is changing all around us,
while celebrities become our guides in
[SPEAKER_08]: materialism, the new mantra.
[SPEAKER_11]: We live in an era where we're obsessed by
celebrity.
[SPEAKER_11]: We live in an era where everyone wants a
route out of their ordinary lives,
[SPEAKER_11]: and people want a quick fix these days.
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea of learning a trade from your
father or doing a five-year apprenticeship
[SPEAKER_11]: has gone out of the window.
[SPEAKER_11]: People now want to go on Big Brother and
become a celebrity overnight.
[SPEAKER_11]: People want to be away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a reason behind this modern-day
madness?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are our material lives making us truly
content?
[SPEAKER_10]: If I want to know what the truth is,
I have to live truthfully.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as long as I live as truthful to
myself and to others, then I'm like in the
[SPEAKER_10]: vibration of truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Therefore, it will resonate with me or
not.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is a ratio to it all,
a rhyme and reason behind everything that
[SPEAKER_08]: we do and everything that affects us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does this really happen by accident,
that this whole universe and us living on
[SPEAKER_10]: this planet, in this fragile atmosphere,
in this one place in the universe?
[SPEAKER_10]: It is beyond thought.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is beyond words.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is a purpose to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once people start connecting with what
they think and what they believe,
[SPEAKER_02]: once you start taking the more innocent
point of view that their ancestors took,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is still hope for the
survival of the human race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they don't, they will poison
ourselves off this planet eventually,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like mad magicians seeking to rule the
world, men of renown have fleetingly seen
[SPEAKER_08]: the epic nature of the ancient code and
its alluring essence.
[SPEAKER_08]: But all too often, they fall into an abyss
of their own making, choosing the wrong
[SPEAKER_08]: side of the code.
[SPEAKER_08]: But today, we too have missed the point in
our everyday complacency.
[SPEAKER_08]: We choose to exist in a waking sleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: We spend time naming things and separating
them, classifying endless parts and pieces
[SPEAKER_08]: without remembering the whole,
the one from which all things come.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs no hatred nor warfare.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs no drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It simply is.
[SPEAKER_08]: For you are the key to the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've found that point of connection
in yourself, where you are part of nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the world around you and it is
part of you, then no secret, no quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: physics, quantum spirituality can get
anywhere near that point of unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no deep connection because you
have found yourself and you have found
[SPEAKER_00]: your own God within yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a dark winter's night in January 1983,
the sleepy Welsh village of Clunyllar near
[SPEAKER_03]: Aberystwyth was buzzed by a strange flying
craft of some kind which hit trees,
[SPEAKER_03]: scattered shiny metal debris over four
fields and flew off apparently unaffected.
[SPEAKER_03]: One farmer witnessed the debris in
clean-up operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: One national newspaper carried the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: One civilian investigation team made it to
the site.
[SPEAKER_03]: One collection of strange metallic debris
remains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Witness for the first time ever in graphic
detail, genuine pieces of a crashed UFO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the wilderness road they come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Behind them, the struggles of the
Revolutionary War.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before them, the conquest of the
wilderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: The journey is long and arduous,
but it leads to a land of promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day after day, the party follows the
unfamiliar trail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bigfoot, also known in North America as
the Sasquatch or the Oma.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was the Sasquatch here before the Indians?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thousands of Indian locations are named
after the boss of the mountain or the wild
[SPEAKER_08]: man as the Bigfoot was originally called
by the Amerindians.
[SPEAKER_08]: Indian cultures generally regard the wild
man with the greatest respect.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is viewed as a special kind of being,
perhaps because of his seemingly close
[SPEAKER_08]: relationship to humans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many Indian elders regard him as standing
on the border between animal and human
[SPEAKER_08]: consciousness, giving him a supernatural
kind of power.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as special as he may be, there is no
tribe that suggests that he is anything
[SPEAKER_08]: other than a physical being living in the
same physical dimensions as humans and
[SPEAKER_08]: other animals.
[SPEAKER_08]: He eats, he sleeps, gathers and
communicates with family members.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems that the wild man may indeed be
of a varied and widespread clan
[SPEAKER_08]: encompassing every continent of the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all have one very distinct trait in
common, an exceptionally big human-like
[SPEAKER_08]: foot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our search for this film brings us to the
great state of Kentucky, the Bluegrass
[SPEAKER_08]: State and the home of the Kentucky Derby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throughout the last 100 years,
there have been many wild man sightings in
[SPEAKER_08]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a light from the road.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a blue light.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting brighter and brighter and
brighter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, look through here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look through there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't see it, but the camera picks it
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back up so you can see it again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to walk over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you zoom in on it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is something.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't see it, but the camera can't see
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't take your camera off of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just stay there and let it move.
Don't lose it.
