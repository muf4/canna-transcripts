[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry and seed
[SPEAKER_01]: posers are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are The Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew here with my cohost,
Thousandfold, and today we have someone
[SPEAKER_01]: very special with us that I've wanted to
interview for a long time, and people have
[SPEAKER_01]: been asking for us to talk to you for a
long time, and that is Shabud with 707
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for showing up, and it's great
to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand, did I just totally steal the
whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know how much we can add
to 707 in terms of the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should know who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we can start right away with,
what were your early experiences with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and how did you get into growing
and breeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Early experiences, I grew up in the hood.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the early 90s neighborhood
that I grew up in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the 80s, it was all cocaine,
heroin.
[SPEAKER_04]: 90s came around, became meth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got used to sleeping with sirens.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I left, when I moved away,
I had the hardest time falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was living in the woods,
super quiet, not used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day I hear ambulance or car drive by,
instantly out cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The neighborhood was just that kind of
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got introduced to it really early.
[SPEAKER_04]: Older brother and sister as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dad smoked too, but never really.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was little, he had plants in the
backyard, but I had no idea what they
[SPEAKER_04]: were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I don't know, I got ADHD pretty
bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just kind of self-medicated,
not knowing why until I got older.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it just kept my mind straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could focus a lot better than without
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were you raised in Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bay Area, Concord, East Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: City boy, latchkey kid, random muck my
whole childhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: In and out of trouble all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I lived with a bunch of different
family members.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was 14, I moved to New York
City with my sister.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was in this coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next door to the coffee shop,
there was this liquor store that just had
[SPEAKER_04]: this rack of high times from years and
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had almost every single issue out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then every day after work,
I fucking bought a high times with my tip
[SPEAKER_04]: money, looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the time when like Phototron and
all that shit was inside of it and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: cut and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after work, I would get one of those,
go back to the apartment and start reading
[SPEAKER_04]: about it and daydreaming pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I get back to California,
like this is my ticket out of the fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: hood.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, at that age 14, I was like,
I know exactly what the fuck I'm doing and
[SPEAKER_04]: how to get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I was about 16, I made it back to
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lived with my parents for a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that, I bounced and just
started living with garages, couch surfing
[SPEAKER_04]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had a little park.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read my BMX down there, planted some
seeds in the little creek over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mid 90s, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it doesn't have seeds,
you're getting 4,500 bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I planted some shit out in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing ever turned out really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dried in the fucking woods right there,
just hanging them in trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we pick them premature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the weed like at the time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing nothing but green, but my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every once in a while, we'd get the brick
or you'd see it in the neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you had a shit ton of options.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat piss was huge back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had probably five or six different
varieties of cat piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, just a skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we didn't have names back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was dank or swag, green bud,
kind bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this like the era of the shite and
swag shirts?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it was a little bit before
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the terms kind of caught on,
it was like kind of after the people
[SPEAKER_04]: calling her and you just call anything
dank and short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was making seeds just part of growing for
you at the time as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just part of the process?
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also doing my thing back in the day
at Twomp Sacks, $20 grams and $60 ace and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seeds never really came to me until
probably like late 20s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buying the high times back then,
I remember seeing super silver haze first
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out or white widow and all these
cool things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always just would go through the
catalogs and fantasize of what I'm going
[SPEAKER_04]: to buy and what I'm going to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first started really growing,
I did the Bay Area thing in the park for a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it just got me by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I got my foot in the door by one of
my old dealers, called him Tweaker Rick
[SPEAKER_04]: back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: He ended up burning his dealer by spending
all of the guy's money on Elton John
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking tickets thinking he's going to
scalp him in the fucking concert and make
[SPEAKER_04]: triple his money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, he might have sold two tickets and
he took everybody he knew to Elton John.
[SPEAKER_04]: His dealer ended up getting burned.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way Tweaker Rick repaid him back was
he introduced him to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we started working together,
but I was paying still Tweaker Rick's
[SPEAKER_04]: ticket at that point, the guy who slowly
made his money back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we made a relationship and he started
trusting me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was much older than me at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then one day he's like, hey, come up to
Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went over there and he had a house in
Scotts Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had this sweet underground in his
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a three story house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much the attic was all converted.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a secret door and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He showed me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started trimming for him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was the coolest thing ever at
first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually he was like, do you want a job?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved to Santa Cruz in a fucking
bitching ass house.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just became the assistant pretty much
and took care of all the bullshit he
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: He taught me hydroponics, rock wool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then, there was no fucking carbon
scrubbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have the fucking technology we
have now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had general hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you doing flood and drain at the
time?
[SPEAKER_04]: We were doing flood and drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was top feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was top feed, but it was a recycle
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were using GH321, rock wool cubes on
rock wool slabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, what kind of strains were we
growing back then?
[SPEAKER_04]: We were growing Big Bud, Mongolian Indica
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Greenhouse Seeds, that Mongolian.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had another one called Black Star,
who knows what it was and a couple other
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one called the asthma,
which was the Santa Cruz strain that was
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking kick ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to find that for years,
but I think it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard anybody speak about it
since then, the asthma?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, never.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one in Santa Cruz called asthma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's two in Tahoe that I've been
trying to get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_04]: One was called the Afghani Queen and the
other one was called just the club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were great too, but who knows
whatever happened to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't find those either.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you mentioned high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else were you getting your
information from in terms of growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, all high times?
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the mid-90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't tell your girlfriends,
you didn't tell anyone back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't tell my best friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pretty much lived a lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: People ask me what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I was an electrician.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went out and got a beer back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you were able to finally leave a
message on them, I would leave a work
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you reach ENJ Electrical Services,
please leave a name.
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody really wanted to check up,
hey, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no information.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all you learn by trial and error.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had asked that, but that was about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a couple of other books out
there that I had read back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: but pretty much for the most part,
it was trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you start working for this dude,
at what point do you start taking it on
[SPEAKER_01]: your own?
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up getting busted with Operation
Green Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was in 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: The DEA ended up following everybody home
from the Hydro Stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then in the Bay Area, you had
Berkeley indoor Hydro Store.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had one in Berkeley called the
Vivarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a store in Sacramento called
Green Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a store in Nano's Day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the name of it,
but the guy Hans.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it for Hydro Stores back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, in Santa Cruz, they had to open
one up in Aptos.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fucking DEA were following everybody
home.
[SPEAKER_04]: They followed my boss to a different
grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had another couple growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they would throw out their trash,
the DEA took their trash, searched through
[SPEAKER_04]: it, found something.
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, raided their house.
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, they raided our house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I was a kid back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pops knew who they were going for,
so they ended up grabbing the boss man and
[SPEAKER_04]: left me alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went back to the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hustling, and then the Beasters came
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: The BC we came in and pretty much
annihilated my hustle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still high grade, flavorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The BC came in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked pretty, but now pounds that were
going for $4,000 are now $2,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the first few years of BC,
if you found somebody that was bringing it
[SPEAKER_04]: in, I know some people that made hell of
money, hell of fat, then ended up in 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years' prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just made way too much, way too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, talk of millions, and then they
ended up getting busted and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the BC came in, it pretty much wiped
out my hustle.
[SPEAKER_04]: People didn't want to play that high
ticket anymore and just wanted that cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you see, it happened every 10 years or
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, I was just like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to be up in the mountains,
so it's top area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working at the ski resorts,
and then that's when I started just doing
[SPEAKER_04]: my own thing pretty much full time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Started with indoors, did the house top
with the rock bowl, top feeding,
[SPEAKER_04]: recycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then shit never really turned out that
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember how it happened,
or if I read something or somebody told me
[SPEAKER_04]: they were like, stop the recycle system
and just go to drain and waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then as soon as I did that, all my
problems went away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything turned out incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still using GH at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so that was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about changing to drain
to waste?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think changed the scenario?
[SPEAKER_04]: Salt buildup.
[SPEAKER_04]: The salts would be where you do the
recycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had eight lights at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's going good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I started incorporating a little bit
of outdoor at the property I was living
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a five acre parcel, but my landlord
lived right next door on the other five
[SPEAKER_04]: acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still had to be pretty discreet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I was living was, come on,
vacation, leave on probation type place.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't having it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I did was, there's this huge
blackberry patch.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a little crawlway where some
critters were crawling underneath it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up following that into the middle,
cut everything out of the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ended up digging down probably like two,
three feet so I can get some more height
[SPEAKER_04]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that's where I planned my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Occasionally my landlord would come over
and she's like, it smells really skunky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there dead skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I don't know where to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my start of really trying to do
outside growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still, now at this time it's 99.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even outdoor weed is still getting four
grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to grow it very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm young.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came from nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The money I was making was incredible for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then slowly every year after that,
the little blackberry bush patch got a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit bigger and finally I was able
to move out of there and get a bigger spot
[SPEAKER_04]: and do more of the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody told me, you pay your bills
indoor and you retire off outdoor back
[SPEAKER_04]: then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started doing the outdoor more and
more and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, let's see, I've gotten in trouble
a few times in this town.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last time they were pretty much like,
don't give us a problem, we won't give you
[SPEAKER_04]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Left to Willets, Mendo, pretty much where
it was a free for all.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had money for an attorney,
it was pretty much legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't have money for an attorney,
you were going to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I'm starting to do more outdoor,
I knew a seed, you'll get double the
[SPEAKER_04]: yield, half the problems than growing a
clone outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm buying seeds from everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time I'm reading their description,
it sounds great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get hard on from it and then I grow them
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even one of them fit the description
or maybe if I was lucky, one of the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: would fit the description of how they're
describing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most times out of 10 seeds, I'm getting 10
completely different plants and it just
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not feasible for a big monocrop
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can fucking do better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided to start playing around and
making my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my seed was made for commercial
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different harvest times, different
flavors, mostly flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a flavor guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't make off water, I don't
really want to fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of the plants you were
growing outdoor and first making seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: with?
[SPEAKER_01]: What got you going on that as far as
strains go?
[SPEAKER_04]: My very first strain cross I ever did was
trainwreck cross to Lado Uno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lado Uno, JC Brains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lado Uno, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I ran it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making the seeds is like art to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my creation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my art.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my passion and not just seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I breed chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I breed rabbits, dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that creating and making my own
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where the real passion lies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then just being able to, the gamble,
the rush of it, it's like you never know
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're going to get until you grow
them out, until the very end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you're waiting six months and
it's a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows with other people, but yeah,
that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was the Lado Uno trainwreck, was that just
like a super lemony type strain in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that come out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was a trainwreck cover pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first just playing around and
then I got the cat piss cut, which I had
[SPEAKER_04]: been searching the Pittsburgh piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had several different cat pisses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We named them after the dealer or the town
we bought it from.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the Nate piss or we had Tom the
bomb piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was this girl we called the Claire
piss or then you had the Martina piss or
[SPEAKER_04]: the Pittsburgh piss or the Danville piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking that was the Amsterdam turf
probably profile back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was skunky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was skunky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 2004, 2005.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the cat piss train and I was looking
for the piss and I was looking for the
[SPEAKER_04]: roadkill scum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought that the cat piss and the
roadkill were related a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got the cat piss and I was like,
cool, I'll arch these, make some seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: grow them out and hopefully find the
roadkill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did it, didn't find the roadkill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I crossed back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Made some more seeds, tried it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't find the roadkill inside there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all just cat piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pittsburgh piss, which I worked,
was actually the least of my favorite out
[SPEAKER_04]: of them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you choose to work that one then?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you choose to work it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one I could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I searched for data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Days and days, spent thousands and
thousands of dollars on people claiming
[SPEAKER_04]: they had it and traveled all over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with the skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spent who knows how much and traveled all
over and so it's been bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, because you mentioned
making seeds partly to solve your own
[SPEAKER_00]: problem as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go from that point to actually
selling seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that quite a gap or does that happen
quite quickly?
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started making seeds in the early
2000s just for that sash, just fun,
[SPEAKER_04]: passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I didn't start selling seeds
until 2018 or 19.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only reason I kind of did it was
just seeing, I was sharing seeds with
[SPEAKER_04]: people and then a few of these people
started seed companies with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, I was like, hey,
maybe I got something on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I decided to come out with
that brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember, I know what you're talking
about specifically for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to the cat piss, what notable
things did you find working with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pittsburgh piss?
[SPEAKER_04]: Short stout little plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my old high school strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone from the Bay that's in their 40s
remembers the fucking Pittsburgh piss or
[SPEAKER_04]: what they called it, the Uncle Bob,
like the actual guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we always called it Pittsburgh piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like the high school strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like hearing the old timers
from the 70s being like, oh, the Acapulco
[SPEAKER_04]: gold or the Panama red.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like those old flavors that just
remind you of little incidences or the
[SPEAKER_04]: past or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where was I?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I worked at the piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the same time as I'm working the
piss, I'm going to the computer tech
[SPEAKER_04]: school at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of my classmates, their family
owns this huge farm in Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pretty much own like half this town
Williams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day the guy comes to school and
he's got all these brown spots all over
[SPEAKER_04]: his shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what the fuck were you
doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said he was spraying, he was
spraying their melons or their cucumbers
[SPEAKER_04]: with silver nitrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, well, you got feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure he was cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, they were spraying with silver
nitrate for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, he doesn't know I'm growing
weed at all, but so, so he, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm picking his brain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he tells me, and there's this
other thing called floral that will
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse pills into females.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now my fucking head's just spinning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, I don't remember what the
floral was for, but it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now I can't wait to get fucking
home to like, start looking the shit up
[SPEAKER_04]: and play around with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so the, the reversing the males,
I thought, you know, I still think it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a, it's a huge tool to the breeder
because females, you smell it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you smoke it, you know, exactly what it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The males, you know, back in the day,
before I even knew I would do the STEM rub
[SPEAKER_04]: and how they grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much how I selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never knew what you're getting at the
end until you grew them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, with reversing the males,
now you can fucking pinpoint exactly the
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't put that, you know,
a cover up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, so I was doing that and I could
pinpoint turps at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sometimes you'd find,
you know, like three or four different
[SPEAKER_04]: males you really like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take each one of those and I would
cross each male to its own clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so let's say, uh, the cap is,
so I took four different cat piss,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, males and I would cross each one to
its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then grow all those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I can pinpoint exactly what male
is doing what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What male is passing which trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then pick out the best one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, I mean, the process takes a
fucking long time, but like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't making seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was, I was breeding solely for
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in 20 years, I can have what
I want, um, and not lose those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, real quick question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you go, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question for you, Shai, is when do the
forums come into play for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Forums came in play in 2002.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started blowing glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was taking classes with this purple
and humble, and I met this guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff, who goes by cannabis reverend
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was part of the hash bros with space
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so I met Jeff, um, and he was like,
why don't you go on the computer and look?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what, you know, scared
shitless.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you know, I, I still not very
good on the computer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so he introduced me to overgrow and,
and I started going on there and browsing
[SPEAKER_04]: for a little bit scared to type anything
on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, uh, that was my experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: With, with, uh, with the forums to start,
or yeah, overgrow was the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it went to, uh, shoot Canica
banner, something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember them all now anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you do cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you a cannabis world dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a cannabis world too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cannabis world where I met a lot
of, uh, a lot of my friends now 20 years
[SPEAKER_04]: later, um, Rosso refo and, and.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lord overtook and, uh, see chip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seaweed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hear your guys' stories and that's
the only reason I know that was before my
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then funny story about like what a
small world it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy, Jeff, who introduces me to
the, to the forums, him and I go to a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cup in Vancouver once and he
lives in Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm chilling at his house before we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this other guy comes over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're talking and it's Fletcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, uh, so we're talking,
uh, we're all pretty young and whatever it
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, years go by, I'm on the forums now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, the doctor hits me up and
he's like, Hey man, not knowing that we
[SPEAKER_04]: have met before I have, I'm going the
other energies back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, let's trade some strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was another guy from Oregon who
wanted to meet up who said he had the
[SPEAKER_04]: roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't remember what his name was,
but was it, was it, was it paradise seeds?
Mod?
[SPEAKER_03]: Paradise seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he work with the Oregon later collect
Kailua kid?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he come out with a, did he come out
with a, a seed bank too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichome Kings later on, but he had
brothel brothers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the West coast dog guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's who it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so I met up with, you know,
Fletcher and him, you know, when I got to
[SPEAKER_04]: the place, I see Fletcher, I'm like,
Hey man, I fucking know you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I know you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like crazy small fucking world,
huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, uh, that's, that's,
uh, that was my start of the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got introduced by Jeff and,
uh, no look back ever since.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what a fucking game changer that
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is now you can ask questions and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I remember like,
I remember Boggs posts back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was pretty trippy and,
you know, I, and I tried out everybody's
[SPEAKER_04]: tricks and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever pee on your plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Kendo said, I had never peed on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pee on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a kid though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who, like who, who, when you just first
got on the forums was most influential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it like the bog type people?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really stands out to me and remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He seems to be a big like, uh,
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of people from your era,
like his posts his, his, because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: real thorough, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I tried all those tricks,
like the blackout for 48 hours and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things maybe I noticed difference,
but other things, you know, my,
[SPEAKER_04]: my style is, is the kiss method.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super simple net.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, now I'm all dirt organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I haven't touched hydro in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever get the hankering?
[SPEAKER_04]: The what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever get the hankering to go back
to hydro just for shits and gigs?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I could pick out, uh, Rockwell grown
weed just by, just by the look.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, um, I'll never get that or train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Train wreck for like the first six years,
nothing but train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, the hydro and train wreck will
never, never do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, I'm not much of a fan of
indoor anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Myself personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only the cost that live in California
and the power bills, if I can read the
[SPEAKER_04]: list, it's the smoke of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, doesn't really get high anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sun grown is, is, is my, by far my
favorite or a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely have more.
[SPEAKER_04]: More kicks than indoor green indoor grown
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of dudes say that I don't have as
much experience with outdoor being that
[SPEAKER_01]: where I came from, like it was so fricking
hot that nobody was really getting good
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I am so blind when it comes to
outdoor that I never really got to
[SPEAKER_01]: experience a lot of really great outdoor,
even still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to cruise up bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't buy anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I get all my nutrients from my
critters, uh, mostly rabbit shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, chicken shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, of course I use,
uh, like bone meal and, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: what else gypsum or alfalfa, you know,
amendments, um, how fast and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_04]: but for the most part it's just chicken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, uh, rabbit shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the chicken shit I amend in the
soil as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just make rabbit shit tea fucking,
or I just top dress with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's awesome actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our mates had a question for you
about your outdoor style, which was,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, do you grow in big, uh, do you go on
the ground or in containers?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I grew up with, um, pretty much
I've had over a dozen farms, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: different areas all throughout Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just depends on the location.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown straight in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I grow in pots, uh, beds, just
location wise, but I've done it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've even, um, like when money isn't all
up there and I can't afford some stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've even just thrown mounds of dirt on
top of the ground and just planted in that
[SPEAKER_04]: without using pots or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what do I prefer?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in smart pots, they definitely grow the
best.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow the fastest and the biggest,
but then like you're growing 12 foot
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and now you got this two foot pot,
you know, work getting on the ladders and
[SPEAKER_04]: having to work with super, super tall
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what we did back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: You try to grow big fucking plants to stay
within your limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the game, it's like, here's medical
scripts and here's plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go fuck off now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's six of them at 400 pounds total.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're trying to max out with those
six plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, you know, so different
styles for different areas, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: where, where I am now, you'd stay in their
guidelines and you know, you just grew as
[SPEAKER_04]: big plants as you could.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I went up to Trinity County and pretty
much Trinity County was, uh, as long as
[SPEAKER_04]: your neighbors don't call the cops on you,
you're fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you're able to go all out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I still, I still did mostly big plants
there, but then I started catching on,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, just smaller plants, smaller plants do
much better outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quality wise, uh, the buds look better.
[SPEAKER_04]: They taste better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, are they stonier?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're stonier too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it like, once you start passing five
pounds plants, the, the quality goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The look goes right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trade off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, last couple of years, I was working at
a legal farm for a company and there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I told him, I was like,
dude, pack them in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit ton of small plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, that was hella fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, we did, uh, I think it was like
20,000 seeds last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I got to grow a shit ton of my own
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, grew a bunch of other
people's stuff and, uh, still growing
[SPEAKER_04]: other people's stuff, you know,
that I don't want to my own horn,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, um, you know, my shit's gotta go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other people's stuff, same shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like one out of the 10
would be whatever they described or it
[SPEAKER_04]: was, you know, every plant turned out
completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a, as a breeder and as someone that
bought seeds, like when, at least when I
[SPEAKER_01]: started my company, that was like one of
the main factors that I wanted to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was the most annoying part for
me was that I could not get any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reliability in these strange descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, if you think about like Dutch
flowers, they had some of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: copywriting ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'd read that and be like,
damn, really metal tastes like fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew out a bunch of those, the metal,
the metal haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a couple of them that floated
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, actually that one still stands
out to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember how easy it was to trim and
like the spear buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I mean, you know, it was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, you know, mind blowing,
but it was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the structure, I think it was more of
the structure that I remember just how
[SPEAKER_04]: well it grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so we did, we did for years and
then, um, you know, getting raided,
[SPEAKER_04]: kicking, kicking me out of town.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, you know, every time I got
raided and I'd have to put my property up
[SPEAKER_04]: for sale, like the value had just
skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even with, with like telling people,
Hey, you know, the cops said they're
[SPEAKER_04]: coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would still want to buy these
properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I was like, Hey, well,
maybe, maybe that's the ticket right
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so then I started buying properties,
building them up, you know, grow a year or
[SPEAKER_04]: two out of them and then flip them and not
task.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That ended too, with everything else fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, properties that North that
used to sell for five, five million and
[SPEAKER_04]: like humble won't even sell for $500,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was that, um, and with like the
seed breeding, it's, it's what I fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: love to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the gamble of being able to create
my own thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I love the fact that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know like in 10 years,
let's say, Oh, gee, goes, it's seeing,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got OG seats and I know they're going to
come out and G, you know, I don't have to
[SPEAKER_04]: dig through them all or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're, they're going to be OG or,
you know, the campus is going to be campus
[SPEAKER_04]: or Betsy or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, tell us a little bit about
some of your main breeding males.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the males, uh, should.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the chem dog is what put me on the map
is what a lot of people were using,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, to start seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so chem dog, like I don't,
I don't even have these males anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, every year growing
outdoors would pick out, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what I thought was be cool males and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I take them in and reverse
them and play around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew push cleaner was one of my
major cash croppers for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, it's, it's similar to train wreck,
but different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's got that old Amsterdam 90s
Jack turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that, um, the cleaner or was it,
uh, Jack's cleaner that you used?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so it came, the male for that came
from Lauren.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he was on Kanaka banner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the male came from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Jack's cleaner too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, uh, I kept on pestering him for
push cleaner seeds year after year,
[SPEAKER_04]: after year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he can't go so generous every year
he'd given to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one year he was like,
look, here's the fucking mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I made my own and then,
uh, what was cool was, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he ran out of seeds and I was able to give
them back thousands of seats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had crossed that male to a bunch of
different things and I had grown them all
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the push, the one with the SFP was by
far the winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kept growing that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then every year I'd save the males,
reverse them, see what was what.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now at this point we got labs out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I can take after I reverse the
males and I can point the turps and I can
[SPEAKER_04]: send them in the last to get them tested
for potency and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the, for like the, the push cleaner
mail that I use that to date has been my
[SPEAKER_04]: highest testing mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like when you're testing males,
you know, there's just like the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the males turn out like, um, what's that
string green, green spool, green spoon or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just a green spoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just like a stem with little
tiny little racks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little brackets.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how, when you reverse the mail,
that's what they look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, to get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are going to be bugging this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of me to ask you about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to hit it when we first
talked about reversing males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain the different structures
that form and why one, not only,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only because of the floral,
why you don't smoke it, but how they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually form when you spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think a lot of people are
picturing you spraying this and all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden you have a big butted female.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, like I said, it's, it's like the green
spoon, a little tiny seed bracket on,
[SPEAKER_04]: on top of they're going up, uh,
barely anything on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some strains I've noticed more like,
uh, short stout indicas will actually
[SPEAKER_04]: produce a tiny, tiny little bud on top,
but it's still more of just the little
[SPEAKER_04]: node or little bracket grown on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but not, not full buds or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just enough to where you can smell it,
um, get a little stickiness on your
[SPEAKER_04]: finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially doing it to make the male
produce more, uh, oils so you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get at least a few traits, breeding
traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, uh, just the turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so when are you able to,
um, with the labs opening up, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and then the male will also seed
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's got seeds in it and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so your, your lab samples aren't that
great, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, uh, when I tested my cat piss
males, there'd be anywhere from 10 to 12%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, you know, anywhere from my
average at that time was like eight to 15%
[SPEAKER_04]: THC with testing males.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, the Cush cleaner male that I
tested, I'd had reversed a ton of these
[SPEAKER_04]: Cush cleaner males every year,
just going through and reversing and
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping the best one and playing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year, grow out more Cush cleaners and
just repeating the same process over and
[SPEAKER_04]: over again for quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally I came with the one that
I used for my Cush cleaner experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that one tested at 19%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's fucking strong, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I made, uh, my little Cush
cleaner experiment, I pretty much took
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that had really good flavor to
me, but lacked potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I hit everything with that and then
grew them all out that, that, that Jack
[SPEAKER_04]: turps is super dominant with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like this stuff was all Jack,
which I just discarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the ones that were the mom flavor
carried through, um, those are the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that I ended up releasing, which,
which is, um, you know, like, like the
[SPEAKER_04]: forbidden fruit one is one of my favorites
is I call push no more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, the, uh, Cush cleaner males
totally added potency to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the, the phenos that I have,
the types that I kept, um, it's a,
[SPEAKER_04]: the green ones that you really want to go
after it's, those are more of the Cush
[SPEAKER_04]: cleaner stoniness, but that forbidden
fruit flavor where the purple ones are
[SPEAKER_04]: more leaning towards the forbidden fruit
where it has no power behind it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so actually that's where I am right
now is, uh, I'm digging through all these
[SPEAKER_04]: Cush cleaner ones, all these Cush cleaner
crosses, uh, the forbidden fruits that
[SPEAKER_04]: started making some feminized with them
right now are the Cush I sort of making
[SPEAKER_04]: feminized with the green ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, like these things, they,
they taste so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll roll with maybe, uh, thinking I was
going to take one or two puffs,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up smoking the whole fucking thing
and it ruins my day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask, uh, what made you return to
them, them breeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's what people want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and it's, uh, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hell easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it saves me a year of, of,
uh, breeding with males, maybe even more
[SPEAKER_04]: than a year rather than having to pick out
the males.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, then, then reverse them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first you grow them out, you pick out
what you think is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that that's, let's say, uh,
four months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you've got to grow them out,
reverse them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another four months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, then you pollinate and grow and grow
them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're looking at another six to eight
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also add in, I can just, uh,
narrowing, narrowing the trades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're skipping years at that
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, without, uh, you know,
th there's the plus side of thems or it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hell easy and it's cutting out hella
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the downside of it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is things are gonna get bottlenecked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's not going to be much,
um, everything's like, if everybody's made
[SPEAKER_04]: fans of the same shit, you're going to
lose out on a bunch of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm still doing, I'm still doing both,
you know, I'm so like, uh, I'm digging,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just dug through the potions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I'm gonna turn those into fans
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my next project is the,
uh, the, um, not blue moonshine blue
[SPEAKER_04]: blueberry muffins or something from,
uh, Humboldt seed company, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: hell they see the dishes, but again,
no, no potency, but some of these cush
[SPEAKER_04]: cleaner ones has all the flavor and all
the potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like with those, I'm gonna start going
to F2, F3, F4 with, um, um, I'm hoping,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, I'm working on trying to get a legal
spot, uh, small, just do a 10,000,
[SPEAKER_04]: a 10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, square foot area greenhouse and,
uh, just do some real breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, numbers is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to get through thousands
of plants.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about being able to see
thousands of your own strain and be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through that huge population that
really, that really changes how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to look at your own line too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like you pop 10, you might see seven
be one way, but you pop a thousand,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might not see that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same, the same distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully fingers cross everything
works out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm hoping by it's in a year,
uh, to at least get my foot in the door on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows if I'll be up and running,
but that's, that's the goal for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a question from high and
lonesome about, I believe you were seven
[SPEAKER_00]: or seven OG Kush male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked, why did, why did Chad decide
to use the SFV?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he try to select for ideal OG trades
or for a seed line representation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the mother, um, he thought he was able
to improve on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed the last part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just were there traits he felt he was
able to improve on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I picked the, I grew out all the
OGs one year, um, every OG I could get all
[SPEAKER_04]: my hands on and that SFV and my body
chemistry, uh, just matched, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: by far my favorite of all the,
uh, of all the OGs, some of them you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: did more, um, this one didn't yield as
much, but the flavor was there and the
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking high for me is incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was, that was why I chose that
SFV.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, like I've worked the triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked ghosts and all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it would be hard for the,
I think it would be pretty hard for the
[SPEAKER_04]: average smoker.
[SPEAKER_04]: If like you gave them a bud of each one of
those OGs for them to be able to tell a
[SPEAKER_04]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like splitting hairs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that, that, that, that SFV for me
was by far my fave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, it was, it's making the
seed so I can smoke them or smoke that in
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years or whatnot.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you're breeding, like,
and you actually smoke, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't like your own personal
preference and brain chemistry comes
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can definitely, uh, appreciate that
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that SFV was, uh, you know,
that's had stash for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I got Betsy, which is, uh,
San Diego or Betsy, which, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: great story a little bit about Betsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know that's one that's starting to
build up a lot more popularity again,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks to you and CSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so Betsy came from a guy, but dealer,
but dealer online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he got it from somebody down south,
brought it up to Humboldt and kept on
[SPEAKER_04]: saying Betsy, Betsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember thinking, I was like,
dude, what a fucking lame name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I remember him bringing it one year
and just these massive big buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, fruity mango-y like a, like a baby ate
a shit ton of mangoes and then shit them
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, stinky funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I was like, okay, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not OG, but it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I grew it out one year outside
and I was like, Whoa, like this is,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, it fucking yields hella good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hella easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finished middle of October.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one of the strains where you
could, uh, vaccine seal it up,
[SPEAKER_04]: put it aside for eight months,
come back, open it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it smells like you just harvested it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it was one of those strains where it
was either you loved it, hated it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, had people say both, you know,
and then, uh, sometimes they got fed up
[SPEAKER_04]: with old Betsy, you know, I'd label the
bags OB.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they got fed up with it, I would say,
I got Oregon blueberry now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love the Oregon blueberry,
but hate the old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called the mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so Betsy was, it's a fucking great
cash proper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It finished middle of October for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was awesome too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I had to, I had to split up my
harvest is to be able to fit everything in
[SPEAKER_04]: the dryer room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pineapple tie, another big plant,
nice pineappley, but finished early.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was like first week of October.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it numb?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got them switched around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Betsy was first week of October,
pineapple ties, middle of October.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all the cushions and the sours
would be at the end of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had a tie that was finishing super
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the history on the pineapple
tie at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, when I was going, yeah,
it's, it's, it's been floating around
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern California for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but when I was digging through the
seeds, like, it's definitely got some kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of haze in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause some like super like NL five haze
turps would be popping up.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but besides, I have no, I have no
idea who brought it, what it is or
[SPEAKER_04]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever had the Colorado before
Collins cough, Colorado cough?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think that the cough compares
to, um, the pineapple tie?
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow, they grow the same,
they grow the same, different finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: times in different flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different, different flavor and definitely
finished different finishing time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, pile pies, the earliest sativa
looking flavor across, um, Spears kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: grows like that metal haze actually,
but taller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: NL five stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have that or maybe some kind of
other haze in it, but it definitely,
[SPEAKER_04]: that flavor pops up when I was first
Korean, like the first generation of seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: that was coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but not anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you'd be able to find
anything like that in the seats that I
[SPEAKER_04]: have anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just all pineapple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question from booze on, I think it comes
back to the old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, his question was, what are your
thoughts on acclimatizing typically or
[SPEAKER_00]: historically outdoor varieties to suit
indoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so in my experience, I've noticed not
all strains that do great indoor will do
[SPEAKER_04]: good outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, uh, humble snow humble snow is
fucking incredible indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's white kind of got this bubba
skunkiness flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it's done really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but when you grow it outside,
it's, uh, it's barely frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and kind of just has a watered down,
like wet animal or cardboard smell to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and I've noticed a lot of strains like
that were indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things do really great, but when you
take it outside, not so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, now things that do really good
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed do great inside as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the opposite, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so like Betsy was originally made as a
indoor commercial strain, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like bull rider and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be the sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like allegedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard so many stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the one that kind of sticks out to me
is that somebody said white widow super
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was, and when I was digging
through the seeds, I definitely had some
[SPEAKER_04]: white widow looking plants and smells
coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: White shark, I think.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: White widow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That great white shark was one of those
other ones who were going in Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny you mentioned that I'm still chasing
a great white shark, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, who actually had another one of
those was Fletch.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had one that finished hella early and
that was super frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a grapey flavor too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of his old, I don't know if he still
holds it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the end of part one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really want an abrupt ending,
so I wanted to put something here because
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't all of a sudden hit the credits
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but while I'm here, I wanted to make
sure to, uh, shout out lifted seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, great, great seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, uh, Riot Seed Co Europe for all
of the Riot Seeds Europe needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gert Buy Seeds on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our buddy, Matt Booze out in
Australia for all your Aussie needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have riotseeds.com as well for all
of your reversal spray and Riot Seeds gear
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the Canon Illuminati gear,
all that stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some new, uh, diesel drops coming
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some diesel Femmes and, uh, yeah,
dude, so much, so much, so much exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: new stuff from breeders, that elite stuff
coming in soon, the Chem D I-95 work,
[SPEAKER_01]: plus probably the mobile one work he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been trying to push him to do
that for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have in part two, there's going to
be some good reveals from Shaw because
[SPEAKER_01]: there are things that I thought were
common knowledge that aren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: common knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, he is the reason a lot of us have
some of the most rare clones we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that'll be really cool to
bring that forward because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know that stuff and maybe,
um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you'll see why we hold him in such
high esteem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, also, if you have any questions about
your, uh, seed collections or breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot, we're opening up seed
consultations, uh, collection
[SPEAKER_01]: consultations, giving you some ideas on
what you actually have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not even sure how we're going to
price this or how it's going to work,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, hit us up in the Patreon Discord,
DM me in Discord or on Instagram on Riot
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure no underscores before or after,
you know, there's all kinds of scammers
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I, I, I get asked a lot about
this and I know it's a big want from
[SPEAKER_01]: people, but it needs to be affordable in
some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
