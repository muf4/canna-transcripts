[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Greg, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, just being seven years and
all that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your teeth falls out,
your hair falls out, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys enjoy life and travel when you're
young.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's far more fun, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, a lot of the brothers I
serve with, I think that's a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: appeal in talking to you is that your
experiences, unfortunately, a lot of your
[SPEAKER_03]: peers and colleagues are unable to share
their stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I have to thank you as an indoor
grower for all your horticultural
[SPEAKER_03]: contributions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if it wasn't for your work with
the Northern Lights, many of us wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have had the success we've had today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was kind of a group effort out of
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, had the lights and, you know,
we were all young and we're just hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just wasn't doing anything for
PTSD symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't, I mean, even comparable to
anything that we got in Asia when we went
[SPEAKER_01]: to Thailand and Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, it just didn't get
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically had to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived in First Spell in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived in the Ballard area and I was
actually shopping at the Indoor Sun Shop
[SPEAKER_03]: for a few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And around that time is when I learned
about Steve Murphy and his books.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious, around what time did you meet
Steve?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I went to high school with Steve,
like at Ballard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Ballard High School?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I lived, literally lived like two
blocks away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was growing upstairs in the apartment
that I was renting, but I knew that the
[SPEAKER_03]: history was right in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Kevin and the other Murphy
family then?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Sean, Steve's son.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's who I've had to, that's who I
spoke to the most, Sean, just trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: ask him questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you originally obtained the afghan
from Steve Murphy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right after my first son was born,
he invited us over to a party and he gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me four seats of an Afghani variety he
said that some friend brought back on
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the, that was the real wide
range frame that was in his first book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a picture of that, I was always
curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that's the one he gave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we crossed out with everything we
could get our hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We crossed it with Mexico and we crossed
it with Thai and we crossed it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a whole bunch of seeds that we only
got to basically use about 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I mean, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the males that you got from those
seeds that you crossed into?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we got two males and two females and
we just made more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also basically took the seeds
that we produced and then we put the
[SPEAKER_01]: available in town, you know, which was
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a lot of cross and then figured out
real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were never going to be able to test all
these and the cops were banging on
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's door and everybody got to
jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty chaotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: In bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can't imagine at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Steve, the Afghani you got from Steve
Murphy, how does that relate to Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights 1?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Steve Murphy, did he call it Northern
Lights or was it just an Afghani?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just, I came up with the Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original spelling of the Northern
Lights that we sent to Neville was like
[SPEAKER_01]: L-I-P-E-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it got over to Holland and it's
just, this is Neville's cousin Robert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was basically handling the catalog and
he basically like, he changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: spelling, but the original spelling on the
varieties that I named, was on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights, L-I-T-E-S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but that's just the historical fact
that everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you spelled it L-I-T-E?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, by Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the name I gave to Neville
and then changed it and we just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: decided that was okay because it was
already done in the catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did you meet Neville?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was over at my buddy's hair salon,
you know, the university district.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's by Fremont?
[SPEAKER_01]: The university district.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there by Husky Stadium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a buddy that had a hair salon that
we'd hang out and kind of do things and he
[SPEAKER_01]: always had a high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the people to read on the table while
you're waiting to get your hair cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a little ad in the back of
the high times, you know, and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's first ad, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the 84 year or so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sent him some seats and it's about
six o'clock in the morning and I get a
[SPEAKER_01]: phone call.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old lady announces a phone call and
it's Neville saying, I had a hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: tracking you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we basically talked and he says,
man, I need some more of them indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just blowing the doors out of rose
and balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, that's good,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're probably a lot fresher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Ed gave them the seed collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had given some previously to Ed?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that comes later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we talked for a while and he
offered to pay for my airfare over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first trip over to Holland was on like
a Martin Airlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about $210 one way and it was a
prop plane that took forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically, they picked up the
passengers in Oakland and by the time they
[SPEAKER_01]: got to Seattle, they were already drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Seattle passengers piled on
and we had about a 10 hour flight over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time everybody got there,
we were pretty burned out and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never was right there at the airport
smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year do you think that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over like in the early,
it was like 84 and like 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I went back with the wife after
he bought cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you went over the first year in 84 by
yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I basically, I helped him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's just, I do a light recipe for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because like he had a,
he had a little operation in his wine
[SPEAKER_01]: cellar in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a nice basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever been to cannabis castle?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've researched a lot about it and
certainly on the bucket list.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you share seeds with Neville
multiple times or just, uh, when you found
[SPEAKER_03]: the ad of his?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said Neville, let me see two shipments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one smaller initial shipment and
then I went and I talked to a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: them and I got together with my people
after I got back and then we shipped them
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't the only guy that was breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had, uh, we had like a team
because due to the police pressure,
[SPEAKER_01]: we basically wanted to basically have all
these screens and at least three people's
[SPEAKER_01]: hands in case I didn't know everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the bus that maybe we can keep it,
you know, but it was, I mean, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: losing battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the original cross was
with Steve Murphy's Afghan that you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, with the Afghan to get more seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, maybe four seats,
but we wanted to get more seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, then we crossed it with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like a lot of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you recall what the Northern lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one cross was, uh, the Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one was basically, uh,
Steve's Afghani and then the Afghani that
[SPEAKER_01]: I got from Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what Afghan from Neville that
was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the one he got in, uh,
like a Marjorie Sharif.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may know when he went over there with,
uh, like Curtis, uh, the photographer out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard of Clyde.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, uh, uh, Neville told me lots
of stories about how fucking wacky that
[SPEAKER_01]: dude was, how crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, yeah, it's just, I like Clyde
nice guy, man, but he's all we would,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a little different hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my friend Bodie still get friends
with him too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just, he's a Marine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I kind of lost that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like he came up and then we kind
of lost track of each other and what I got
[SPEAKER_01]: a divorce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's just, uh, I mean,
if you're here or see him around,
[SPEAKER_01]: so say hi for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we'll do.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, do you remember which one was the
female or the mom from that Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: lights one cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was like a way too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, like at that point in time,
uh, keeping the records, uh, was a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I didn't like or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pictures or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real liability because of all the
cops, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just the record keeping back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's all changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now we could basically be
scientists.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then, uh, by the only people who could
basically do that on a rational basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was over in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like it wasn't about money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was to get the medicine out to the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the main mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, do you have any memory of what the
Northern likes to cross was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the Northern likes to cross,
uh, was a, uh, it was a cross that we did
[SPEAKER_01]: with Steve's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got an Afghani hybrid,
uh, from gone down in Olympia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one they called the Indian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got it from some biker in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the real nice, uh, I mean,
like a little tighter, but then,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, probably have things that we were
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know where Don got it from,
uh, but it was a real nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a, one of my shorter ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made that number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great info.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, that's great info.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause those, the one and two are some of
the ones that Neville continued on
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's, it's just, uh, when I went
over to Holland, you know, they were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: some, I mean, uh, there were some people
breeding a lot with, uh, uh, the number
[SPEAKER_01]: two, like, uh, Jay Jackson did the K2,
uh, which was a real nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you'll mind me asking, how did you
meet Herbie Nelson?
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand he was an employee of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what Herbie went to Ballard to,
but we all went through the same high
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you in the same class?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is the way I went to Ballard,
where we're all from Ballard, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what can you tell us about his
Hawaiian planet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbie and I, uh, basically traded some
clones and you just said it was a ski bath
[SPEAKER_01]: canny cross with the Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's all he told me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I know, but you know,
I mean, it was an instant success all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it had the hybrid vigor and it had
what everybody wanted at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, you were able to
basically grow a, uh, 24 inch bud on about
[SPEAKER_01]: a five foot flat with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in, uh, I mean, like 84.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, I mean, it was just one of them
flukes in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think where all the genetics clicked and
it all fell into place at the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the clone that you used to make
Northern Lights number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I didn't make number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Herbie did, which is by then we,
uh, crossed number five with the number
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I knew you just gave
us, uh, uh, the 50% sort of sativa and
[SPEAKER_01]: about triple the vigor, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he crossed the clone that he gave you
with the number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was Herbie's, did he have, um,
Steve Murphy's Afghani?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the Afghani that's in number five?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what the confusion was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to understand the
history on that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, that, uh, the clone that he had
or gave to you, that was made from Steve's
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Afghani.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changed the fucking world of genetics
for good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, I mean, like it won some
cannabis cups for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never was real happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that way he bought cannabis castle
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the damage, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think it was a Hawaiian plant
that Herbie had that he crossed with
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have a kettle falling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, I haven't talked to Herbie
and I don't know if he even wants to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, I don't know what the deal
is there, but you know, I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just, uh, I mean, it all happened a
long time ago and there's basically no
[SPEAKER_01]: written record, but you guys are right
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of, a lot of discussion
about the Indian of the Indian,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the Indian was Don down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's passed away years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's just, uh, we met Don when,
uh, by the guy that owns the hair salon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Raleigh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name was a Raleigh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I mean, like he brings a guy over
and why he was an injured book or the
[SPEAKER_01]: older guys, but they weren't given enough
money to really live rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he set him up with a four light opera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gave him some scenes and some
cuttings and he did some reading for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know any of the lines that Don may
have contributed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the, uh, Don contributed half of
the genetics for the number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got, uh, and then after I went
over to the street level, then we went
[SPEAKER_01]: down to Portland and we got the hash plant
land, the big bird off of George.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what time that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when this is a right before,
uh, George did his first book,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with my, uh, this is with my youngest
son on the cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to look at the dates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time you spoke to
George?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I spoke to George was up in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when I basically gave them all the
lead I had left over because I had to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, many years ago, but we're good
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody loves George, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just spoke to him recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a wealth of good information.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very receptive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so that's why I'm interested in
talking to everybody from your generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just, uh, we traded with
George.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of forget what we gave him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we might've gave him the number
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but he gave us a hash plant
and then he gave us the big bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash plant was the one that was a real
good one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a real favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a real shitty yielder, but
everybody loved the taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the one that was that Neville
collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously when he visited the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he went down and saw George and
the people in Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do, were you aware that Neville came in
and visited the states?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went down to the airport and saw
Neville and he was drunk and had his head
[SPEAKER_01]: up his ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was with Roger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know who Roger is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roger Grand, which I think is the
spelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was Neville's like American
representative first and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kind of, he kind of flew into
Seattle and then he went down to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Clyde in LA and then he went down to
Rosenthal's.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was kind of like a Neville's agent in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where, what airport did you see Neville
at?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in a hotel, just used to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got sure what one, it was a long,
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of hotels on that road.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think the purpose of that trip
was to get more Northern lights or was he
[SPEAKER_03]: just coming for genetics in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got no idea what was in Neville's
mind then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, that's just, oh, that's way
beyond my favorite.
That's fair.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to keep together the
history of all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year is that estimate you think that
you flew in?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I knew like 85, it was around
Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that it was cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had you sent him the Northern lights five
clone before that trip?
[SPEAKER_03]: Clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just a Roger came and he
sent one over to Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, you know, we got him a clone
and he got one of these, uh, glass pole,
[SPEAKER_01]: terrarium things at some florist shop and
he trimmed the leaves off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't serrated and that's how he
got it over to Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just, just to recap, you said that
Kirby made the NL five.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you got that clone, you were
giving it as an L five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was on the NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I mean, like Herbie's,
uh, cross with the Hawaiian and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Steve Murphy's Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you, you didn't make the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got the clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, we took it to see and we gave him
the seed first, but I mean, like he wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: the original qualms, but we got him the
original qualms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the seed never received came off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Herbie's mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, by the seeds, I mean, it's just
like he got, uh, he probably like a what
[SPEAKER_01]: we cross with the number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what we did after we got the
number five, we basically began crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: it with everything we could get our hands
on and what, and it's just a, what we got
[SPEAKER_01]: looked real similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's what went to level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like about the same size with
that, like amount of vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was the vigor and the taste and
it was just far superior.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried to read, I mean, like a
replicate that I do in seeds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and we've been working on it for a
while, but we, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are variable clones on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do you think you guys kept
Herbie's clone around?
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost that when the cops raided,
uh, John lost dad after his son took over
[SPEAKER_01]: the operation and then we had some crop
failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, I don't know if anybody has
the original quote clone for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if Neville or,
or it's just, I, you know, Scott,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, shanty Baba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they might have the original clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I don't, I don't think
anybody in Seattle does, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of all the seeds that you guys
made, was there a favorite that stood out
[SPEAKER_03]: to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We liked the indicators, the shorter
indicators, the number, uh, the shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: ones with the, uh, what we were looking
for was more medicinal value, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a quick turnaround.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're talking about Don down when
Don, the Afghani hybrid, was that a clone
[SPEAKER_03]: that he gave you or those feet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we got both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Don also had something that he
gave us that he called big bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, uh, man, like it wasn't the same
as a big bud we got off of George.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was fluffier and it had more
oil content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the number eight of the
ML number eight sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the real fluffy big bud that had
all the oil glands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used to go down to Don's and get a,
I mean, like a pound or two and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how the people they'd come back and they'd
dump it on the table and then they'd go
[SPEAKER_01]: for that number eight by every time they
could see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mix it all together.
Usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were just doing the one,
two, three wide operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the numbered one through 10 or the
number Northern lights were those using
[SPEAKER_03]: these Afghani or the Northern lights
number one that you made?
[SPEAKER_03]: Both.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just depends on the number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the higher the number, the taller the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's how we kind of, how I kind of
determined that it's simpler for devil
[SPEAKER_01]: with the more Afghani with the ones and
the, and the more specific with the
[SPEAKER_01]: others, you know, and the higher you got,
the more specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have you been in Hawaii,
Greg?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to die here, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, have you been there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, I was living in Snohomish
County and PUD was running a new program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we couldn't, I mean, like a rip off KW
is a day of power anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to retire and move.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know anything about the Snohomish
Super C?
[SPEAKER_03]: Club?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that was like started in
the nineties, a little group of growers up
[SPEAKER_03]: there that had a bunch of clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy that talked to, uh, that was up in
Snohomish County would be John Pettit,
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy that basically is at, uh,
Stuber's discrediting where everybody was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting their supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you were, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never, I may have met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize I was, I used to shop up
there because that was the better place to
[SPEAKER_03]: get the wholesale supplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was cheaper than the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Pettit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I mean, it's just, uh,
it's a family operation up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a John and his mom and his sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole family operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to, I used to basically get
everything up there when I was working
[SPEAKER_01]: with the city of Seattle, when I got out
of the Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my time up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, the homeless is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farmer country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were living in Arlington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little further north.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I like being produced up there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The over production is going nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I mean, look what's going on
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure they're going to be selling
concentrates for a buck a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's certainly going that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, you guys are seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just these big guys that,
I mean, they're going to, they think they
[SPEAKER_01]: can go indoors and they can kill him and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can't compete with the sunlight
in Mexico or the labor cost, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you, did you share Northern light
with, uh, the Draugriss family?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just why I milled like a fan and
teased the whole collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is, they were real helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave us the fertilizer formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in mainly, uh, it's just a,
we got Neville fertilizer for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we got Benz fertilizer for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and then we came back to the U S and
we made our own fertilizer and it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: two part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we had a two part before General Hydro
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we called it Wonder Girl and that we
got busted in the old way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, uh, the rest is all
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have anything with, uh,
Dave Watson and Sam, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's always been kind of,
I'm better than you and I'd say I'm the
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I mean, he's always been
a real disrespectful as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like he's done a good job,
but my hat's off to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like he can take his ego and
cram it up his ass as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I feel too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the universal opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have many friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, I just like to be
real now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old enough, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I served my time and I, I mean,
I, I mean, I don't play for like free
[SPEAKER_01]: speech, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never met Sam or Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came to Seattle after we ran our ad in,
in the Alexander's magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never met Sam or what I heard
about Sam was basically from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was the ad, the grow light shop
ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's when Rob came up, we spent about
half an hour at my house out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: shoreline district.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went to a concert up at
Parker's ballroom and we watched a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: silver messenger service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, they're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of, and then he met all my
people from Seattle and, and, and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically after that was when Green
Merchant happened and everybody got
[SPEAKER_01]: busted, you know, it was, it sent
everybody into shock mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Rob respond to a speed ad or a
lighting ad in the magazine?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a company and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bow barrel was going to basically handle
all of the paperwork over in all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to have, we were going to
mail the seats out of the US and collect
[SPEAKER_01]: the money and all, but that never worked
out because cops raided us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the ad was for, they put in some
similar tips just for seats though?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what year that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 85 or 86, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alexander's old, I mean, my old copies,
I think Wolfie might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, I feel like it wasn't a big ad
and then Rob, uh, like he came up and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, no, like you guys are the new guys
on the block and this and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we told them, you know, I go like you
and Sam down in California, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just, uh, you can't breathe
like we do indoors, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys do, I mean, it's just,
I mean, like a one crop a year and we do
[SPEAKER_01]: six, you know, and he didn't like that
very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, how did you meet George?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just called him up, I think after he
began writing in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, called him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like he knew everybody
down in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when, uh, I mean, the Hydro Tech
and George were having, uh, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a like wars on, uh, on the
Portland TV stations.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you meet Wolfie Gall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Wolfie, I met at the Hydro Tech,
like he worked for Kevin over there on
[SPEAKER_01]: Aurora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just, it's like,
and then they opened up the Portland store
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, uh, like Wolfie got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he did five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just, I went underground,
you know, I mean, like I had an old lady
[SPEAKER_01]: and a couple of kids and then,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't need to name that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned him, the lawyer that kept
everyone out of jail.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, uh, I mean, he was like a
gift from above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody loves Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody still loves Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and the prosecutor love Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think Steve ever got to,
uh, experience any of the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses you made?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, I didn't hang around with
Steve all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, I'd see him at the store,
you know, uh, but there wasn't a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he actually selling feet out of the
shop or it was just because you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it was, I mean, it was a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he, I don't think anybody
was selling feet out of the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a manager, Jerry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you meet Jerry, the older guy that
does the carnivorous plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ringing a bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was Steve's manager at the indoor sun
shop for, I mean, like a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he was the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry, I don't remember the last thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Alzheimer's is a bitch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the brain cells start rotting boys,
enjoy yourself while you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a pretty sharp memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, you've got a better
memory than I have and I'm at about 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it told us good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a testament to the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it takes it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it takes a little beating on the
loans, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted me to be a judge in the
cannabis contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be up there hacking all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the last thing I want to do
in public is be hacking and overdosing for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, like Emory did when he got
out of the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what any of the other crosses
are?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of the other numbers of some of their
parents?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we didn't keep any records.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could have, you know,
but it just, uh, Jeff told us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, everything you have,
they're going to use against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the less you have as opposed to this or
that or that, you can keep telling
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, you know, keep the plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get greedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like he's a smart man to listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you had one light, it was one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had 20 lights, then they considered
there was a lot more serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, uh, the ones they wanted to
get off the street was the, I was these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys that were doing these bigger
operations and we're also into the harder
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's generally the case.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, uh, well, yeah, they carried
the same penalties pretty much back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if one got more money than
the other, most people fucked with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just all the blankers were
some of our best customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they almost, I mean, kind of
demanded to get their name on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it was a, I mean,
it was a real valuable commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like now, you know, then you had
to get your name on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you didn't owe somebody,
I guess it's just your name on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had people coming out from all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They flew in from Chicago and Virginia and
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I couldn't do anything with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get cops for them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure everybody's blown with a tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we kind of had to play dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I got an old lady and two
kids and I can't jeopardize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but now how are all these?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the difference between, I mean,
it's just a night, I mean, like a lighten
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you guys, you guys have a
real opportunity and have done really well
[SPEAKER_01]: with the varieties that are coming out of
the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is where parents come in to get
his genetics now.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did all these people find out about
Northern life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just for the ads that you guys are
publishing or how are they coming out from
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicago?
[SPEAKER_03]: All these areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran, I mean, a couple of ads,
fertilizer and rock wall for a while until
[SPEAKER_01]: we had to close this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was more trouble than it was
worth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many people were you saying
involved that were in the breeding of a
[SPEAKER_03]: different Northern life?
[SPEAKER_03]: You said it was kind of a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was a core group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was, I mean, it's just,
oh, that's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there were people that came and
went, so it's just, it would be up around
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically it just kept changing because
everybody was in and out of jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, it's hard to put a
number on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I really thank you for all your
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you have addressed all of my main
questions after reading some posts at Mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knight's forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that Matt Knight can continue to
reach out to you with any questions we may
[SPEAKER_03]: come across in our research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you guys have a nice, what,
afternoon or evening or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you too, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just feel free to call anytime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: We genuinely appreciate all the time and
all the access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean nothing much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come here for other genetics now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was all meant to happen,
you know?
Thank you so much.
