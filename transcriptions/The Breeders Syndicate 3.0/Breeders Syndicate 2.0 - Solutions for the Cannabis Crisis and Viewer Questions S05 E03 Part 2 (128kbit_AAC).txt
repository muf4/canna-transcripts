Boom!
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are back for part two.
[SPEAKER_04]: We apologize for any inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of lame.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of lame.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should be working and I see people
joining, so hopefully audio is working now
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll get back at it in a short
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long time no see, motherfuckers!
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for you guys who tuned in to the
UFO classified show I did earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks everyone who showed up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're back!
We're back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have comments again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have comments again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did that to me the last time I was
doing an auction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did the same shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just froze on me and I wasn't seeing
what people were saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it happens when I pin comments
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just screws up the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more pinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All equality in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: No favoritism.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I do think that all the
public commentary this week calling out
[SPEAKER_00]: certain people is one of the better ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, someone asked, well, how do you
educate the public, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of it is just like the stuff that
we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we do a show that's not like,
that's not all about us or whatever and we
[SPEAKER_00]: try to talk about different aspects of the
weed industry and different content and
[SPEAKER_00]: some history and different things because
educating people is the best way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people on your side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk about Matt, with Matt all the
time about this, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we really have to like build a
coalition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be political in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or a syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to, we have to build a
syndicate of like-minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be pretty diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important part is that we don't
want to eliminate a ton of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to like have a general set of
goals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be all inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, whether, whether you're
politics or you're this or you're that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, you got to be relatively
accepting of people that share those same
[SPEAKER_00]: basic goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, those basic goals are like,
not only do I want weed to be legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want people to be able to do what
they want with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I feel like, you know,
I know that you rolled your eyes for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second when I said, oh, we're winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a sense, you know, because it does
feel like for cannabis industry people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does feel like a pretty dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of change happening fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pricing, which used to like fuel the
insurgency, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I mean, there's an aspect
where it's like, it was so hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody to beat the Taliban.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had a bunch of heroin in the
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were able to fund their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when prices were higher,
the insurgency in America, as far as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, weed rights or whatever was,
was better funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the price falls apart and various
things, a lot of people start to struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but then, you know, the side
benefit is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people get into it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the coalition can get way,
way, way bigger than it ever was before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be scary for all of us like who
depend on it solely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because change is scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so what it boils down to is the reason
why I said we're winning is because for
[SPEAKER_00]: half my life, they told me we couldn't
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they want to steal it from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they weren't successful in preventing
anything we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we had to battle them for a
long time to eventually get to where we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't view it, I don't view it all
that much different than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the goals and the,
and the idea has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going from like access and,
and freedom and not being jailed and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that to like, now we get to choose like,
well, how do we want weed to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we want it to be like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, you know, so there's,
there's an aspect of it where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people have had access to
most, except there's a couple of people on
[SPEAKER_00]: here who disagree, but there's a,
most people have access to pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, there's some, there's,
you know, there's some people sadly that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been exposed to a bunch of jank,
if you will, and are unhappy with their
[SPEAKER_00]: access to weed, but lots of people's
access to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has gotten much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone trading is easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't have, I mean,
I don't like clone sellers all that much
[SPEAKER_00]: to some degree, but to be honest,
like if you, it might be a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: only way to get at certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's available and it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's not, it's not,
it's like, you can build a collection now
[SPEAKER_00]: with some money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have finances, you can at least be
given the illusion that you're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, and in some ways that's,
that's more, that could be, that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: as satisfying as waiting around to get
into the right groups for years and years
[SPEAKER_00]: before you start getting some access to
some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it's negative in some ways,
there's positive in other ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: because my whole goal with weed is more
people smoking better weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people are talking about,
I can barely find weed without the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fair because really,
I mean, we were, we're, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: jump around, I guess a little bit if we
start talking about that, but basically
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Instagram, we like to get into a
lot of petty fights with one another.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might even be someone that like,
you know, has participated in a petty
[SPEAKER_00]: fight every now and again, some of them
are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are, are good natured and
good hearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are a little bit more,
you know, we, we, but we got to pick our
[SPEAKER_00]: battles because it's like, you know,
you might be battling with someone,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like both of you were like,
well, I'm not, I don't believe in working
[SPEAKER_00]: with cops.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this consensus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, we want a consensus of
better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell a story for a second,
because there's an aspect of this that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think is the truth is, you know,
when, when we made alcohol illegal with
[SPEAKER_00]: the, with the, whatever amendment it was.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a bunch of time, only the,
only the mob, and everybody else ran
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was so much drinking and so
much lawlessness around it that they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically repealed it because it was
better to have it legal than illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They over grew over drank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were, they didn't overgrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they were seeing a lot of tax
dollars go out the side and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so, but then there's an
aspect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, um, for the next like 50 or 60
years after they legalized it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they forced them a bunch of shit beer on
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, near beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, it was like when I,
when I wasn't, when, and just even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties, when I was going to bars in
Chicago, like the nicest beer was
[SPEAKER_00]: Heineken.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if during prohibition alcohol got
cheaper when it was legalized or if it got
[SPEAKER_04]: more expensive at the quality,
I guess you're, I guess there was a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of shit cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what I'm basically saying is
that it broke the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It broke the relationship to quality for a
while, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Decades even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody could choose between Coors
or Michelob or Budweiser or old style or
[SPEAKER_00]: fricking, you know, Keystone or,
you know, it was all cheap, shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: Pilsners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was this like revolution
that happened, which was basically like
[SPEAKER_00]: people deciding, well, what if we just
brew good beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, um, you know, the Budweiser,
Budweiser makes half the barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a Budweiser now that it did in
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the biggest beer
companies in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they ended up buying 15 or 18
micro brews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they want, they didn't want to
lose their micro, their, their share.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I mean by that is that what's
going to come is people are going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to start selling really cheap,
really shitty weed for expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hoping that's your only option and you
just deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't know that there
are better options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to these like,
you know, legal States or whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, that maybe some of them
don't have the greatest history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that some of the more fortunate States
do in terms of like large amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and access to really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might've had, you know, Mexican or
beesters or, you know, sort of the low
[SPEAKER_00]: grade of what comes from the better
States, you know, shipped to their state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to push for, you have to
push for better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because they're going to try to
sell you okay weed for high prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to vote with your dollars on
better weed, you know, and then if your
[SPEAKER_00]: doll, if you can't find better weed,
then grow your own and keep your dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: in your pocket and spend it on something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then eventually if enough
people don't buy shitty weed, they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: a really hard time with shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that's such a utopian way of,
I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is logic and it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's such a utopian view to
hope that that will happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But why?
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you all Martin is the biggest
supplier and yeah, but okay, but let's,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that either,
because there's plenty of people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that probably can't afford the quality of
weed that we like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they might have to get lesser
quality weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always going to be, you know,
an existence of the, the, the low quality
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some people that are like,
I'm fine with this weed and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a metal pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll put it in a pipe with a
screen that I never cleaned and it gets me
[SPEAKER_00]: high and I don't care or makes it with
tobacco and yeah, or makes it with tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever that and that's okay too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be some snob,
but what I'm saying is, is that like when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, when I was a kid, okay,
the only way you could get organic food
[SPEAKER_00]: was like on dead tour or like crunchy or
organic co-ops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and now there's whole foods and
there's all these high end stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Organic food in almost every
normal grocery store Yeah, right because
[SPEAKER_00]: people demanded a better grade and they
were willing to pay more for it And now
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden it's everywhere when I was
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could not find organic food in a
normal grocery store Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah You couldn't you fucking
couldn't you had to go find some hippie
[SPEAKER_00]: crunchy store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it existed and maybe it didn't You
know, and so, you know you say oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't do that Walmart's the biggest we
can because we did with food Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know It wasn't just hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what people got to realize right
is that hippies did not Make organic food
[SPEAKER_00]: a household name Yeah, yuppies did yes
hippies provided the basis, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: these fucking yuppies right and they look
around and they're like I drive a European
[SPEAKER_00]: sports car I have Italian leather shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is hot and gets plastic surgery
like I make a lot of money a year I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation home in Breckenridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I why am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shopping at the same place that everybody
else shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want nicer food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You don't think they're not gonna
want fucking 120 day haze at some point
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the first places I saw organic
stuff popping up in California was places
[SPEAKER_04]: like Santa Barbara You know like like
really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well to do areas in like beach
communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started seeing lots of organics Yeah,
and now it's now it's spread everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's I mean, so there's a there's
enough people that are gonna want high
[SPEAKER_00]: grade good smoking weed To have a huge
market of high-grade weed It don't it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't have to be the whole market You
know, it has to be enough of the market to
[SPEAKER_00]: supply that We just want it we craft
Right, but yeah, but but the thing is is
[SPEAKER_00]: that like all those yuppies that I just
mentioned that did that's a organic food
[SPEAKER_00]: When they what do you what kind of weed do
you think they want to buy?
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is food is different than weed
food Food one is it's necessary Everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: eats food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's eaten food their life
experience with quality Not everybody has
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked weed their whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has experience with quality to no
quality when they're getting it I mean you
[SPEAKER_04]: could see I can see yuppies buying $80
cookies eights and these baggies and
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking they're getting the supreme
quality and they can be They can be
[SPEAKER_04]: confused into it and I think we're gonna
see a lot of that because they would have
[SPEAKER_04]: to search out the education You can't
force education on these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going it's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take time in in the organic food
case We're talking over a 20 or 30 year
[SPEAKER_00]: period, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah right and what's gonna be left in 20
or 30 years with weed and strains and all
[SPEAKER_04]: these things that we're going to lose over
that 20 to 30 year period because None of
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that run these grows that are
gonna be able to survive and compete
[SPEAKER_04]: Monetarily are gonna be the ones keeping
these old strains with these Qualities so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're correct and I'm not trying to be
You know remember that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the theme is like what can people do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than like give up hope and like
we're not trying to we're not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: drink bleach tonight So okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so the aspect is is that there's
going to be a ton of people out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed that Don't rely on weed
entirely for their income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are lots of people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that can Save a few strains in their
collection as a hobbyist sure right there
[SPEAKER_00]: are there are people that can buy one or
two packs from their favorite readers and
[SPEAKER_00]: that and that adds up like You know when
when I'm talking about food in the 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: think about like all these heirloom
vegetables that just popped out of nowhere
[SPEAKER_00]: They were maintained by like a dedicated
group of traders and like and enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: without very much without very much money
in it For a long time that's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risk is is that they their shit wasn't
highly regulated and taxed and illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they could grow fucking 45
different kinds of tomatoes in their
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard and trade it with all their
friends and mail it all Over the place and
[SPEAKER_00]: trade seeds and no one gave shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they haven't let us do that yet with
weed So they're making our job fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making it harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's easy It's fucking
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have a big I have a big mom
collection, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks It's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's fearful and you know,
we're still paying electric bills from
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago Oh my fucking god, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But but there's an aspect where
there's you know, there's 215 people
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to us right now or whatever if
each person decided there's one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: strains I love and I'm gonna try to make
sure this one stays alive and Then
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of people start to do that then
not everyone has to hold on to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very true but if a couple people
just if enough people decide to hold on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the electric boogaloo and a couple people
decide to Fuck and hold on to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91 and these people decide to hold on
to some haze and you know, I mean honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that I don't lose shit because I
do lose shit is I try to find people that
[SPEAKER_00]: love certain things and I'm like and these
four or five these four or five things
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they grow and they love I'm not
asking them to hold on to anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want Yeah, but they don't want
to lose it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in love with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have you know, it's one of
the ways that deep that all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: survived, you know and and You know and
and there's an aspect to it too where I
[SPEAKER_00]: did this for a long time and now all of a
sudden a bunch of the stuff that I have is
[SPEAKER_00]: like in demand or whatever because It's
old and it's like it there's not that many
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have held it that long Yeah,
but everyone on this thing has the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that to one or two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a constant thing like When we were
throwing our little cannelluminati parties
[SPEAKER_00]: before kovat fucked everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I would mostly honestly
guys I would mostly grow one or two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three things for the market But then I'd
have a section of the greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just like my heads Yeah,
it's dash and I probably brought what did
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring like probably 20 or 30 different
things each year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd say that's fair if not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right, you know, I brought me
brought a bunk You brought a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things for it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then so then you know, it's like
trading amongst you And your friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke some of this good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try this weird thing out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a space for hobby So if we
want if we want like we can't trust
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations, we can't trust cookie We
can't trust JBZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't trust fucking glass any of these
people to halt to be like a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: library No, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna say it's got to be diffused
and independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Because even if those people did save
it they would save it to profit off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes So it's not like they'd give you
fucking access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like oh how great I mean, you know
There was a there was a question that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody asked about the impact of T
tissue culture on breeder markets and
[SPEAKER_00]: collections And maybe I'll maybe I'll jump
into that for just a second because We're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna name names here either but
Matt's lost his Matt lost a chunk of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: once trusting in that and there's an
aspect where people are offering all these
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking services, but They're like give me
all of your life's collection and let me
[SPEAKER_00]: hold on to it for you with no contracts
And I'll be tissue culture every single
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I'll I'll I'll bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get it healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just give me all your valuable stuff
I'll hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, right And so and there's no and so
for a collector like, you know that works
[SPEAKER_00]: off the honor system I have high suspicion
That they would just take the collection
[SPEAKER_00]: and do whatever the fuck they want with it
and use it in whatever way Monetized it
[SPEAKER_00]: the most for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And then just lie and say oh they got
it from someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would didn't use your version Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TC to me TC is cool if you want to do
it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah If you want to involve some like big
backed corporation You know or a company
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't have your best interest at
heart with the way the legal scene is
[SPEAKER_00]: around marijuana right now Which is not
very enforceable and everyone bends the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules every which way they want Yeah I
wouldn't say like you would trust your TC
[SPEAKER_00]: collection unless it was Like your oldest
homie and you had a lot of luck and you
[SPEAKER_00]: really trusted him like if CS if CSI
opened up a nursery and like had a You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, yeah our radio, you know There's
various people that are friends of ours
[SPEAKER_00]: that we trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, but for the most part
you're turning your shit over to some
[SPEAKER_04]: stranger Yeah, and if you don't know them
for many many years, it's a stranger But
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you do you're still I mean most
yeah, it's always a risk This is a
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable thing to a lot of people when I
mean, I I joke about it with Matt and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of my friends But like in the last five or
six years every single person that screwed
[SPEAKER_00]: me over has been a long-term friend Yeah,
as the scene has gotten tougher People are
[SPEAKER_00]: making different ethical choices about how
to stay alive and how to keep their their
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, I don't trust TC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust I don't trust the collection
to be entities right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not established enough I don't
like, you know, I just don't trust them It
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean I might not in the future
like it might develop to the point where I
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to take a risk or something like
that But there's an aspect where right now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just kind of wild wild west and like
in the cannabis scene So I just think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're offering to do it because you have
something of value.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Case in point I'm not going to name any
names but with the TC situation This
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't my experience, but I was involved a
little bit There are examples of people
[SPEAKER_04]: taking someone's duddy plant and to to
clean them up Marist M wise putting it off
[SPEAKER_04]: for six months with promises.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, it's going it's going good
because you know a lot of us don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: how long this takes it was a new thing
when this was happening and then returning
[SPEAKER_04]: a Tiny tiny tiny little clone and telling
them that it's tissue culture and it still
[SPEAKER_04]: does it we've seen and this isn't even the
same person we're talking about earlier if
[SPEAKER_04]: there are so many examples of New
technologies coming to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: finding ways To take advantage of of
people who have these collections and what
[SPEAKER_00]: not so that person that person might have
paid $4,000 to get that thing Marist M
[SPEAKER_00]: that person paid $5,000 $5,000 to get it
Marist M with no with no like refund or
[SPEAKER_00]: proof if it if I mean if it tested
positive Give me my five thousand back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should only be You know refund that
shit, but you know what I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that should be standard You shouldn't
be able to charge for some process that
[SPEAKER_00]: fails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that's not You know and and so
so there's an aspect where like not to get
[SPEAKER_00]: lost in the TC thing but But one of the
aspects of these larger companies coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in is very soon the gelato and and and
purple wave and all this cookie and
[SPEAKER_00]: overbred shit It's gonna still exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too popular to like go away
forever But it's going to become a segment
[SPEAKER_00]: of the market not just a market and so
there's a huge interest in Getting back
[SPEAKER_00]: all these old things Yeah, you know and
there's You know for all these clone
[SPEAKER_00]: sellers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one of the risks of selling
clones It's like it could be like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have somebody's somebody that works at one
of these places this gates It's given
[SPEAKER_00]: money and it's like and all of a sudden
you're just buying it Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's like I don't mind if shit gets out
there I just mind if those people if it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets out there and then all of a sudden
they try to claim it as theirs and
[SPEAKER_00]: restrict others access to it Yeah,
because in my perfect world like just to
[SPEAKER_00]: like throw a marker down I think that all
weed that was bred before 2018 should be
[SPEAKER_00]: open source That's a fair statement and
you can't fucking claim shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing before 2018 that you can't
patent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't fucking yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good shit It's it's fucking it's it's
open source to some degree doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you have access to it Right, but you can't
restrict it legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't sue me for having it DJ shorts
but whole is like this tight right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's f'd up, you know, I mean it's
like it is The only reason I said his name
[SPEAKER_04]: is because he has a very public Claim to
those using blueberry and stuff and he
[SPEAKER_00]: does not like that Oh He used to put it on
his packs that you're not allowed to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it But you're not allowed to this
with it that they retain control of the
[SPEAKER_00]: line or whatever the case may be And I
understand that too But that's part of
[SPEAKER_00]: selling seeds is that you're putting it
out there in the world and then anyone can
[SPEAKER_00]: do anything They want with it and that's
the trade-off That and that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: happening since the beginning of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Every single famous Dutch thing every
single famous 90 strain Was was bought
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were bought and and people sold
their own versions of it really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right, so it's been going on from the
but what I'm scared of is all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: someone telling me that like Oh,
no, we we own the chem D Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we own the 91 we own them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We own this we don't you know,
whatever You know So it's like if you make
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the legal market if you have
a legal nursery and you make your own
[SPEAKER_00]: breed and you and you do something like
that So it maybe it starts to get
[SPEAKER_00]: different Yeah, but all the stuff that
came out of the shadows all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: came on a prohibition the whole genetic
library of everything else It's it should
[SPEAKER_00]: be on not owned by anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree and and you know and and that'll
that that that'll really democratize it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know a case in point like I do like
having action with words and With the blue
[SPEAKER_04]: bonnet mail after I made the lines and it
literally immediately after I gave it to
[SPEAKER_04]: Radio Ridge To have it open source for any
breeder who wants to inject blueberry into
[SPEAKER_04]: their lines You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I I try to stand behind that because I
think it I really think if you're good at
[SPEAKER_04]: what you do You shouldn't tie yourself to
one thing and you should be able to make
[SPEAKER_04]: new and unique and go to new different
directions and Be inspired by stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that and if someone else makes something
better than you you should be able to look
[SPEAKER_04]: at that Admire it want to use it and
better it I mean, you know Matt is not at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, but I'm a huge I'm a big fan of the
Grateful Dead right and one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: why they have so many shows recorded is
You know and they played more shows than
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody and they and there's more live
recordings of them than anybody They let
[SPEAKER_00]: tapers they had you mean they made
soundboards, but they let tapers set up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience and bootleg Yeah,
and basically they said after we play it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful Don't bootleg our albums,
but our show as soon as we're done playing
[SPEAKER_00]: it we played it for you It's yours and
They were and people rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, super punk rock, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were I mean they came from prankster
You know from prankster ethics warlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great garage band, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know Yeah, I mean someone just
said I hear a lot of the og lines were bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed all og is bag seed So it started with
a bag seed more bag seeds were created
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's bag seeds of bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's actually Accidental
pollination all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, so so that's what I think,
you know, there's gonna and and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what people can do People can fight
to keep even if you're gonna crop one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two things for your little market or
whatever Save one or two other moms that
[SPEAKER_00]: you to grow a plant or two of every now
and again And you hold on to something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, make it be something that you enjoy
smoking Smoking because that's what keeps
[SPEAKER_04]: you keeping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what keeps you keeping it,
you know and like and Then if and then if
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of different people hold on to
one two or three or four things that they
[SPEAKER_00]: love a lot We'll have a lot more heirlooms
that make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it'll be a lot more
insulated from like, you know the the the
[SPEAKER_00]: too few collectors like me You know who
like there's fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's shit that can happen You know the
more diffused it is the better the better
[SPEAKER_00]: chance we have with stuff surviving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely Before we continue someone did
ask me To talk about and give a kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: public service announcement during these
times in cannabis and I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: important as well a lot of us have lost a
lot of people to suicide and
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the whole economic society in
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of empathy right now and
Realize that like a lot of you guys out
[SPEAKER_04]: there that are in the cannabis industry
aren't the only ones suffering There's a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean This is all everything is all smoke
and mirrors When it comes to business not
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone's happy 100% of the time the
whole seed communities have been hit the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole Weed communities been hit and
there's a lot of people you can talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you can't find someone DM me I'm
available 24 7 and I'll get back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, there are suicide hotlines.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important No mail should be ashamed
from talking about depression or their
[SPEAKER_04]: feelings at all So please if you can't
find someone to get help talk to one of us
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean there's an aspect where it's
like I live in obviously I live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino County, you know And I don't
even want to talk about pound prices and
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's going on at home right now
Because it's the way of life is all the
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect of well, how does one
survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a mortgage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have kids I have this I have that this
has worked for me for a lot of us You know
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in our like, you know mid 30s to
mid 40s or whatever This has been working
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically our whole adult life Yeah,
and now you know and now it's changing
[SPEAKER_04]: dramatically I don't do anything else good
like really like that's not even just a
[SPEAKER_04]: Statement like this is what I have done
most of my adult life and the stuff that I
[SPEAKER_04]: used to do What that's bypassed the
technologies bypass a long time ago and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think a lot of people in our community
that have stuck at this for a long time
[SPEAKER_04]: had share that and it's it's scary the the
Not knowing what the future holds is
[SPEAKER_04]: scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So There used to be this thing like with
PTSD or whatever where like getting busted
[SPEAKER_00]: was like an occupational hazard,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it sucked when it happens and so
we used to be we used to get scared about
[SPEAKER_00]: that to some degree and now It's like
you're not scared about getting busted as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as you are like just failing Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and then that and then that leads
some people to like look around to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know get sellout Yeah, you know,
I'll give you guys a story of back home
[SPEAKER_00]: for a second, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this is what used to happen
when we win the flood hit Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we used to call the flood is when
like the flood of outdoor really hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: market Yeah, right and prices dropped and
not not like crazy like today But they but
[SPEAKER_00]: there'd be an aspect where all of a sudden
like we would be hard to move Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and and and the issue was is it
wasn't like it was hard to move It was
[SPEAKER_00]: more like there was just enough of it that
like some of it was moving and a lot of it
[SPEAKER_00]: was sitting until some of more of it moved
right sure and People would come up and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to me and literally like the brokers
in November or December are vampiric Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're like, oh you have you have
fireweed and you have some savings Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like three months behind on the PG
&E Christmas is coming the wife's
[SPEAKER_00]: terrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two months behind on their
mortgage They got a bunch of fireweed and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to make a dope deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and a lot of times they didn't want
to buy from anybody that was stable for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months Because they wanted to
they wanted they wanted to take advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the poor planners and the people in a
tight spot Where they could get a more
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive deal and they could make a
bunch more margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that was just that's just like
standard that standard business You know
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of times people would you know
back in the day especially people would
[SPEAKER_00]: bury their stuff or not trim it till
spring and You know if you had money you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't sell it till February March April
May.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Because that's when the flood had
passed a bit and the desperation was gone
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started coming up and
looking for just good packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And you know, and so, you know,
there's always been sort of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I brought that up is that
Right now that's kind of what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: is people are looking at seed collections
People are looking at clone collections
[SPEAKER_00]: people are looking around it and they're
like who's desperate who's desperate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cheapest I can get this out of
this who's failing who's Trouble who's
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you know But you're right
people are saying it doesn't seem like a
[SPEAKER_00]: good way to form long-term relationships
That's like you think of brokers and
[SPEAKER_00]: people like that want long-term
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to win every trip to get what
they want Yeah, that's what they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: doing There's not a bunch of there's the
amount of people that like want to form
[SPEAKER_00]: long-lasting benefit mutually beneficial
stable relationships That's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: weed Yeah, you know brokers are like,
you know, they're like they have some
[SPEAKER_00]: stable relationship with you and then they
hear that like some dude is broken is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna sell better weed for $400 less a
pound and They're off that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because that's where that dude is
you know, and so You know and and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and so there's an there's an aspect
of that where you know people People make
[SPEAKER_00]: fun of like well, you know, California is
all booth Yeah, and and there's an aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of that where there is a lot of booth in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me There's a lot of shitty weed
and there's even a lot of shitty We didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mend on Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people are trying to like brand
legacy and brand that like the area that I
[SPEAKER_00]: come from It's like all just just it's
just all been triple-a and loved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not true either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was never true It's true in some
cases, you know, and everyone's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: claim it right now But it certainly wasn't
true for the most part people were plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: content to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay weed and move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right, so There's an aspect there
where like You know, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know it I'm not even sure where
like my train of thought was going on I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: give you something so we were talking
about solutions and I know like I kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: took it off in the not so solution
oriented just mm-hmm this problem were you
[SPEAKER_04]: but One solution and you talked about it
earlier was getting a bunch of people like
[SPEAKER_04]: minded together and now with the syndicate
what I originally What this was originally
[SPEAKER_04]: built for?
[SPEAKER_04]: The big pie-in-the-sky idea that I have
for the syndicate overall first was to get
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone together that's interested in
Weed history that's truly interested in it
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to learn get together We all make
each other better But from there my
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimate goal is to have it be a sort of
and I know people gonna fuck some people
[SPEAKER_04]: flip a union For those who came before us
they don't have retirements None of us
[SPEAKER_04]: have retirements that are weed growers
like that are you know traditional Have
[SPEAKER_04]: fallbacks for that have retirement plans
for these people We have to form it
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves No one's gonna form it for us
and in the only way we can do that is
[SPEAKER_04]: Working together and it sucks because a
lot of us won't work together But I think
[SPEAKER_04]: over time a lot of the the old-school
dudes the people that really care And
[SPEAKER_04]: people that used to butt heads even being
fletcher used to butt heads We don't we're
[SPEAKER_04]: we're cool because we all have that same
kind of thought and goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that that was the overall goal solution
I want to expound on that, but I did
[SPEAKER_00]: gather my train of thought at like 10
seconds after you started talking So the
[SPEAKER_00]: point I was trying to make is that like
for all the people that are complaining
[SPEAKER_00]: about all this California booth that hits
their town The only reason why that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening is because the broker that got
it here and brought it to their Thinks
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't have better options and he
can force booth on you for a good margin
[SPEAKER_00]: for himself Yeah, that's why there's booth
everywhere if you're angry at California
[SPEAKER_00]: Boof don't blame California blame the dude
the dudes in your area that arranged for
[SPEAKER_00]: that to appear in your area Yeah,
and there's tons of Pretty good weed in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and there's some really
exceptional weed and you could force your
[SPEAKER_00]: brokers to bring you that You know and
then according to what like Matt's saying
[SPEAKER_00]: too is Matt and I battle all this all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I What Matt just said is
basically like we need a really big tent
[SPEAKER_00]: We need whether it's a union or whatever
else, you know, people are gonna laugh at
[SPEAKER_00]: that for a second But really what we need
is we need millions of people that get on
[SPEAKER_00]: board with the basic ideas that we think
should cannabis should be and then to push
[SPEAKER_00]: for those ideas and Then in some fashion
eventually we'll probably get at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: niche of our ideas functioning the way
that we want to Yeah, right, but if but
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really good at fighting at one
another cannabis Used to be it's not so
[SPEAKER_00]: much anymore But cannabis used to be a
great place where people with some mental
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses that were untreated could make a
decent living for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes And so, you know and then you could
say, you know, and I mean I know in Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like single moms that like,
you know Just like grab grab some courage
[SPEAKER_00]: and went for it in the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they were able to spend a lot of
time with their kids growing Weed right
[SPEAKER_00]: and making a living for themselves and
there's a bunch of people that would have
[SPEAKER_00]: a hard time working a normal job Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so something we interact with these
people and then they don't fucking act
[SPEAKER_00]: normal Yeah, you know and and then as time
gets tough for them, too They start to
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out and they start to get spastic
and shit starts getting weird so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but You know when it comes down
to it to like people people with issues
[SPEAKER_00]: like they have a right to a living too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah We was a safe space for a lot of
people despite the risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah was You know and it's changing now
You know It's it's changing and so as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of that like there's a bunch of
stress out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But we're really gonna have to like
there I see a ton of fighting people if
[SPEAKER_00]: people notice like I really I don't fight
on Instagram You know, I try to be polite
[SPEAKER_00]: to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to build consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more people Yeah, I might be way
too polite or whatever and sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to eat shit or whatever and not take
the bait and people Are insulting or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, you know, but that's at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not mine Yeah, it's only my problem if I
give a shit what they think that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: true Which I don't because why would I
care what you think when I don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: who you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what you do in life and I
don't know what your vibe is I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: your ethics are one of my good friends has
an issue with me Of course, I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but like some stranger on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pissed off because I don't like
somebody else or I don't like somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I mean Matt, you know,
you can go to whatever Convert him however
[SPEAKER_00]: you like Matt Whatever technique it takes
I'll use words, you know, you do you do
[SPEAKER_00]: you in that regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know it works, you know,
so so there's an aspect there where we
[SPEAKER_00]: want better We we want access to better
weed We don't want it to be we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: all these strains and everything else to
be totally controlled by people because
[SPEAKER_00]: that will stifle innovation Yeah,
you know hobby breeders and small rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: are where almost all of the best new
strains come from Yeah, they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: come from these fucking crisp compound
phenol hunts or fucking did this person or
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're just I don't think they're
gonna come from there People are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: hype shit right and we both know that
like, you know, we have friends and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those people are hype beasts
anyway, and they have way smaller breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: making their shit for them and doing the
actual stuff That's how it works You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't need to I don't want to say a
bunch of names or whatever is just slipped
[SPEAKER_00]: out But the fact remains is that there's
way better chance for one of you guys with
[SPEAKER_00]: a fucking eight lighter Right to come out
with the next sour diesel then like one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these big legal spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But the only way that's gonna happen
is you have to grow good weed and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep good weed in your room And you
have to keep weed you love in your room
[SPEAKER_00]: The best weed comes out of weed you love
Right and so like people were asking
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier like how many how many how many
moms I haven't it varies a bunch But it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like my mom collection is really odd Yeah,
I'm very when people ask me that I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: be like why you want to know my plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not I'm not gonna that's
that's I just meant in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know because like some number
matters or whatever but like There's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect where it's it's heavily based On
what I personally like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whether from a breeding perspective
or whether from a you know a smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective or a combination or whatever
So as a result, there's certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are kind of famous that I don't
really have a bunch of their a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: variations of it Yeah, cuz I don't care
about it You know, that's for other people
[SPEAKER_00]: to care about I like what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already overwhelming enough just to
try to hold on to what I like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really hard to hold on to shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like It's tough Yeah,
you know it becomes tough And so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: expect everybody to try to like go go
crazy and have like big collections But a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of diversity can be saved by people
just doing one two, three, four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Do I hold anything that I'm not a fan
of but as a backup for a friend Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a couple of things or there's some
things that are untested Are there some
[SPEAKER_00]: things that like if I have a close enough
friend And they love something a ton and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want help backing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that motivation sure You know
Doesn't don't deluge me with like
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites that you want me to hold on to
please God because but but yeah If you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a good enough friend of mine or whatever
there can be something that because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how that's how all this stuff survives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah is it is is is friends helping
friends back things up and That insulates
[SPEAKER_00]: you from like angry axes and accidents And
fires and you know all the stupid shit
[SPEAKER_04]: that can fucking make you lose your shit
How about making s ones if you can't hold
[SPEAKER_04]: cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great idea It is advanced breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're new to making crosses if
you're new to Identify males identify
[SPEAKER_04]: females if you're not familiar with an
intersex plant and even when you're using
[SPEAKER_04]: Sprays like the like my reversal spring
for example, you could find a rise each
[SPEAKER_04]: calm you can go get that and When you
spray it, it doesn't necessarily look like
[SPEAKER_04]: a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a female Expressing his
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're not familiar with seeing that
I recommend doing your research digging
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always go to our patreon join the
crew We're always talking about stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: this We're gonna have a private
conversation in a in a few days on
[SPEAKER_04]: reversals and reversal techniques for
small groups So they can get really good
[SPEAKER_04]: questions in but I mean s ones are a great
way to back up seeds But understand that
[SPEAKER_04]: just because you're reversing it or s1
Wanting it or stuffing it you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have an exact clone representation of the
mall So do understand that but it's an
[SPEAKER_04]: excellent way to back up the pure version
of those genetics People are asking a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff that that that is That yes,
all those things that you said are good We
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be having some like more more
concentrated talks with people,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nice People are asking about
super skunk stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I'm not one To like shout from
the rooftops, you know or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that There I do think there's hope that
that some of these old things exist But I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they should be like grown out and
tested and and and sorted out on that
[SPEAKER_00]: level first I think you know a lot of
times when people get like cuts or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and they're convinced that it's
some 30 year old thing and they flex it
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean grow it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah do what's important It's important
and not just to grow it out and it's cool
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you grow it out and you're like
damn this is dang that must be shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That must be it But that's not necessarily
the case just because it's dank doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: mean it's Legitimately what you think it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're gonna grow it out,
you're gonna assess provenance And if it's
[SPEAKER_04]: real make sure you know About it have
anything knowledge about it and don't just
[SPEAKER_00]: assume because it's day that it's legit
Yeah, and you know, and so there's Someone
[SPEAKER_04]: asked what's the closest thing to super
skunk and seed jeezel She's a pure super
[SPEAKER_00]: jeezel or or diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah diesel diesel diesel diesel diesel
diesels and diesels I've said a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: times before I kind of consider the diesel
family to be like a modern skunk You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not exactly super skunk diesel is
much closer to modern super skunk to like
[SPEAKER_00]: an actual pure super skunk but in terms of
like a very skunky like and I don't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: like necessarily in Terps but I'm just in
terms of like the way it forms and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it grows and a lot of the Factors to that
like I think sours sours and diesels have
[SPEAKER_00]: various ranges of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know And so there's plenty
luckily that there's a plethora.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like of sour cuts right now about
fucking I don't know Three dozen or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all that they all tie back to 1995
So it's really amazing that like out of
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere like 36 different individual cuts
that are all the real deal I've popped up
[SPEAKER_00]: in two years But Yeah, you know,
so I mean when people talk about super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk too There's plenty of super skunk in
modern weed and like Matt said diesel is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost a pure super skunk What people are
great example what what people are?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know really saying is that like super
skunk phenos that like have rank skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: turk like aromas That's the missing link,
but there's plenty of like like physical
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions Of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know in the way the flower forms
and the way the leaves are in the way You
[SPEAKER_00]: know various aspects of the traits of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's in a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you know, so and you know,
there's a thing too people are asking
[SPEAKER_00]: what's weak like I'm not I'm you know,
I'm not trying to knock anybody's stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can say that like when I started
collecting sour diesels to compare to my
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel cut that I had to figure out
what name I should attach to the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've held for a long time Probably in that
was like what was that like five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep at this point There's probably like
half a dozen or eight six or eight new
[SPEAKER_00]: names that I met that were never in the
forums Yeah, did you ever hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: Albany sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no did you ever hear about weasel
sour diesel cut on the forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever hear about like the you know,
I mean so there and I'm not I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave her the cop diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So I'm just I'm just saying that like
there's new like nicknames added to sours
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably half a dozen or more just within
the last three or four years that ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never heard about Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what does that you know,
are they the same as other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the choco or are they the Amish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they this or that who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think every time you see someone release
a seedling that's hyped and named after a
[SPEAKER_04]: cut in the form like the sour diesel we
saw Several different breeders release
[SPEAKER_04]: their versions of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's when you see a lot of old
cuts pop up and people's Poppings and
[SPEAKER_04]: selections of brand new lines that they
think is legit enough to pass for the old
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean luckily for people most diesel cuts
are pretty damn nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes They smoke good they get you nice and
high suck it growing and then it'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: boost Because I've sucked it growing
diesels before and it's been fun your boo
[SPEAKER_00]: diesels can be finicky and and they they
can be Punishing and they can not be that
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's I mean there's so there's So
there's an aspect where there's I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I exaggerated with 36 cuts,
but there's probably at least 15 18 named
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts a lot of which claim to be close to
original I love pot asked what names are
[SPEAKER_04]: legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing names aren't necessarily
legit It's the cuts that are legit anybody
[SPEAKER_04]: can call anybody cut anybody's cut any
name So just because someone calls
[SPEAKER_04]: something the choco cut does it
necessarily?
[SPEAKER_04]: mean that it's legit because they called
it the chocolate it's kind of like how we
[SPEAKER_00]: called we called it the dog and until our
buddy got online and You know and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: got named after his online handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Because he was the person passing it
out and you know who you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Amish was passed out by was shroomy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know and the child and like so
Pete things got named on the internet
[SPEAKER_04]: Choco I called the choco because he had
some of my favorite pictures Of it and
[SPEAKER_04]: they were some of the best pictures for
showing people to describe which cut I had
[SPEAKER_04]: so it was called ECSD But I said it's the
one that choco shares choco cut and it
[SPEAKER_04]: just eventually that's how that name
formed the choco cut so yeah, and and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and then there's you know,
there's You know East Coast sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: New York sour diesel, you know all these
So there was like a first wave in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just called sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it wasn't really told the forums and
like the Mid-2000s that name started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting applied to sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then there was a batch of names
and now there's a new batch of names What
[SPEAKER_00]: really what really is happening is that
most people have not held their sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel cut consistently throughout the
eras So you're trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: name is the one that ties back to what you
want?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really hard when you lose chain
of coming when you lose chain of who has
[SPEAKER_00]: what when Yeah, Matt and I talk about
provenance or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the problem I went on to my sour
cut I got it 22 years ago and I never lost
[SPEAKER_00]: it Do I know what it is before I got it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No You know, do I know how what where it
went and how it went between you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid 90s and when I got it in 2000 now
but I haven't lost it and Eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't lose things like you know
that if you hold on to things for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time Then it sort of becomes like that's
part of the reason why I never tried any
[SPEAKER_00]: of these other sours I had sour diesel
Wow, I get a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the one I didn't know that I didn't
even know there was a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got sour diesel I was happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would I go trade someone for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know And people are like,
what's the difference between the two NYCD
[SPEAKER_00]: and ECSD cuts?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's probably referring to NYCD
from cinema.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm talking about the milli I
don't know if mine's the milli that dude
[SPEAKER_00]: that has the milli he got he got His the
same year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got mine in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got mine, which was the Bay Area of
California But we've never exchanged cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: or grown them side-by-side to test I
couldn't tell you but some people would
[SPEAKER_03]: use that as enough info to say yes,
in fact that is the same cut Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean and you know and so, you know He
calls it the milli because it's short for
[SPEAKER_00]: Millennium because he got it at the turn
of the Millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know But with diesels,
I don't really think it's a it's a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison unless you grow them in the
same room at the same time same green
[SPEAKER_00]: house same outdoor Treat it the same feed
it the same and then you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: differences if there are and if it's the
same cut it'll be the same cut Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't I can't compare somebody's LED
living soil grow and at different
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions to somebody else's and if they
just come out too different Yeah And in my
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and sometimes with the same
person they come out different crop to
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah New York City diesel isn't Dutch
booth It is weird and shitty in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that Soma took the diesel Name and was one
of the first people to offer seeds and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was some euro Fruity thing crossed to
possibly a sour bag seed if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe him nine hybrid, it's great fruit
But people have found some nice pinos on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing like sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the good ones aren't like sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Someone's asking about master Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: My boy bitters got a killer version of
master Kush, which is the SoCal master
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush Cross to the Hawks breath and he's
just running through those.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old seed line But yeah,
I'm stoked to see it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're stoked to see some SoCal master back
in the form I'm not gonna I can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna engage a ton on like what
all the different names are because one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that I found with sour names is
like They get applied to a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different cuts at different times And it's
it's really difficult to try to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know So I don't know how I don't
know how like Go back on that one or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and even the headband and a lot
of these things that I've held for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time There's still more mystery than I
would like sure I'm just willing to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's mystery to it rather than
like craft some story of certainty when
[SPEAKER_04]: that exists Yeah story sounds so much
better when they're full of intrigue and
[SPEAKER_04]: mystery, but yeah, that's just how it goes
You know, and so I mean I've had people
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me like people someone just said the
Albany cuts totally Legit, I know someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's had it since 99 people have told
people have told me some of my weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread out a little bit and some people
have been trying it and liking it Some
[SPEAKER_00]: people have told me that they think that
the cut that I have is the Albany for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that's worth But I mean,
I I haven't gotten it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any confirmation of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I You know, I think a lot of people are
throwing a lot of different names at the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and trying to figure out which is
cool because You know at least there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of interest in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel is way better weed Than a lot
of the weed that's being traded right now
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the hype boy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should have a moment of the Sun
Yeah, you know somebody said there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: master there's the only thing I'll say
about master Kush is that it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a there's a SoCal master Kush
that seems cushy, but it's kind of a bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: ish hybrid in my opinion And then there's
a there was a master Kush that we had up
[SPEAKER_00]: north.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was much leggier darker thinner Type of
thing and it wasn't all that But it might
[SPEAKER_04]: have like my favorite Matt Kush flavor I
saw a lot of master Kush grown on the
[SPEAKER_04]: forums from Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the majority of master Kush I'd
see and it was a lot of like big short
[SPEAKER_04]: squat baseball bat not just fat fucking
short squat Afghanis and there was a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of that in the in the big late 2000s from
Nirvana being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that I had someone just said
that's the one not so I had that cut for
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it when I got in some troubles I
got it back, but it was super dutted and
[SPEAKER_00]: barely drank and and you know,
it's uh So we lost it again, but I hope I
[SPEAKER_00]: have it there's a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still floats around Oregon somewhere I
have some friends that gave it out and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that like it'll pop up one day It's
really flavorful some people didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: it as much as far as brokers because it
was a little darker and Wasn't as as poppy
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bag as certain other oh geez,
but man I had a great high and it tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: good But most people seem to have the so
cowl master that some that's it's also
[SPEAKER_04]: really nice But it's a bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot I'm not trying to diss it
at all It's just not the one that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with and it seems very bubba
based It is very bubba based.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is it is a dead ringer for bubba Yeah,
it's it's it's bubba with some it's I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think it has coffee turps like bubba
It can depending on how you grow it really
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a lot of soapy a lot of earthy,
but it can hit coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's depends on it grow it The Irene OG
cut is around various collectors and
[SPEAKER_00]: people have it I read to it it exists And
number two yes, that's the one that still
[SPEAKER_00]: exists That's the one that still exists
and you know the the bubba the original
[SPEAKER_00]: bubba is lost as far as I know What
survives is the bubba kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, which was which is a Which we believe
is a hybrid of the original bubba and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first kush cut that came to LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah A seed found in that I don't think
the original no one no one's told me that
[SPEAKER_00]: the original bubba even exists It was it
was it was a funny looking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Which is a shame, you know Because
you know, like I said Preservation is hard
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people get rid of a lot of
things thinking it's gonna be easier to
[SPEAKER_04]: get it back And then they realize they
can't find it Someone's asking it's if HL
[SPEAKER_04]: the hops late and viroid is something
that's always been in cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_04]: answer to that I Will cover that on
September 8th with to me To me is the the
[SPEAKER_04]: company that we're gonna be bringing on
but the short answer is no it we know
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly When it came and hit cannabis and
who did it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah somebody just asked if I met the guy
that gave me the Mendo perps when I when I
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them like I did back then
enthusiastically and would you trust him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh So that's interesting Back then I grew
water culture total hydro So it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: unlikely that I would grow them back then
like like I like now I have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods now but Sure,
I would grow them just as enthusiastically
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt that there's a lot More
lying going on about ancient strains now
[SPEAKER_00]: than there ever was in 1998 in 1998 nobody
gave a shit There wasn't a family unity to
[SPEAKER_00]: impress on any level, you know,
and so there was less lying and even then
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't tell me very much at all about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason why I have a tendency to
believe That it could be as old as he
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks it is or he thought it was is
because it's low T THC it's got a crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: wide amount of diversity in its genes You
know, and it doesn't seem like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: related to anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know yeah you know, so sometimes the
plant backs up the story better than but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a there's an unbelievable amount
of Bullshit right now with ancient seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and ancient cuts and random shit and it's
there's a renewed interest in old things,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is wonderful but That's led to an
enormous amount of scamming An enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount and I just don't think that in 98
99 2000 2001 there was no extra money and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody cared so I don't think there was
nearly as a reason to lie It just bothers
[SPEAKER_04]: me too because and I'm not gonna say any
names, but people are selling people In
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe it's a big word but dreams.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like things that you haven't had that
you can't quite verify But you want and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're willing to spend good money on and
that's when they sell you that's how they
[SPEAKER_04]: sell That's how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yes, because we're talking about
swapping genetics and trusting people
[SPEAKER_00]: trusting people these days is hard You
know Yeah, and and there's not it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not as easy I mean a lot of times,
you know You have to grow things out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then share that share picks and share this
and that and try to make your best
[SPEAKER_00]: judgments Our buddy CSI grows out old
seeds from people all the time Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of lets it lets it lets the
plants show him what it shows them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Right, and then and then he starts to
believe or disbelieve Someone's asking
[SPEAKER_04]: about Tennessee stud.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a there was the G 13 and all two
from Neville crossed to blue bonnet and
[SPEAKER_04]: Pips we did the selection for the keeper
that we used in the G 13 and all two seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to say names eventually I've said
names for so many years and frankly has
[SPEAKER_04]: made much of a difference If you if you're
interested in names, if you're interested
[SPEAKER_04]: in wanting to get it right if you're
interested in all this stuff The discourse
[SPEAKER_04]: that's just where it is Like if you if
you're really interested in that kind that
[SPEAKER_04]: detailed kind of info join the patreon
discord You'll get plenty of info and then
[SPEAKER_00]: some and then part of the reason why part
of the reason why we have that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: approach and we're hesitant to mention
some of the names on the chats is because
[SPEAKER_00]: like we'll be talking about some wider
subject and matter I or somebody will make
[SPEAKER_00]: a offhand comment about someone specific
and then ten people will send like a 15
[SPEAKER_00]: second audio message of Just that to that
person and then they're all but heard or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're whatever it's taken out of context
or they're doxing me or whatever Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so and and so there's an aspect of
there's an aspect of you know of wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it a little bit more like high
brow and wanting to keep it focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: subject and not just And and you know not
using somebody as an example and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel unfairly singled out Yeah in certain
rare cases when I think it's like crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: enough behavior I mean I will just say it
but the point to these talks is to like
[SPEAKER_00]: educate people and stuff like that Not so
much to just sit there and like vent a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of grievances Yeah, that's easy to
do to sit there and bend a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: grievances and it's really Easy to sit
there and talk about things that will make
[SPEAKER_04]: you money But it's not super easy to talk
about history So somebody just got great
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody just asked if g13 and nl2 is
still available and no no no I gave the
[SPEAKER_04]: rest of those seeds to a seed bank and
They passed them out and didn't put They
[SPEAKER_04]: mixed up packages named them ABCD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just got spread throughout.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know which is which so some people
have them And may not even know it it is
[SPEAKER_04]: labeled by a letter And usually what
happens is when people grow those out and
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see them I can usually tell what it
is because they were all so different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and there's an aspect to of one
of the one of the reasons why One of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why I ask people to save stuff
right it is and hold on to these things is
[SPEAKER_00]: because every five or ten years cannabis
really does Yeah, and things that you
[SPEAKER_00]: think are common and they are Going to be
around for a long time in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't Yeah, and the only way you can
be absolutely sure to preserve it if you
[SPEAKER_00]: or your friends You know if you or your
friends help make sure you stave it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Real quick I was talking with CSI
a lot of people been asking if we were
[SPEAKER_04]: going to continue the normalize project
With the nl1 nl2 the nl2 by 5 that was
[SPEAKER_04]: sent by Seattle Greg and there's a few
others we have been debating it because
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a lot of Politics when we were
Talking about selling the seeds when we're
[SPEAKER_04]: selling the seeds a lot of backs back talk
and weird stuff going on behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really had a series sit and think is
it even worth it?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna go ahead and do it So that's
the announcement right now if anybody is
[SPEAKER_04]: interested we are going to do that But it
again just like the five just like the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaiian lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna do it proper We're gonna take
our time with it Anything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: worthwhile is gonna take time and I should
say on that level that one of the things I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like about the way CSI does and You
know this project that him and Matt have
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing is, you know, they grow out a
few hundred plants Yeah, and they show you
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and oh I I'll do them a little
bit later this fall, but I have a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: selections from CSI that he out of his and
Matt's project together that he gave me of
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of his favorites that he Wants me
to see what I think And and the number
[SPEAKER_04]: eight is the one that he's currently
working on reversing which is the super
[SPEAKER_00]: super stinky skunky one Yeah, I think
there was a there was a I think I got that
[SPEAKER_00]: that one and I got one other one that I
think he was thought was very bubblegummy
[SPEAKER_00]: and The seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I got I got two different ones
that he really liked a bunch and wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: some close friends Like you he gave you
the two best ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know So you have to do to get
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I you know, I Do dumb shit like hold on to
things for friends, you know, so you go
[SPEAKER_00]: there you go I don't even know if I'll
like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to see you know, but they're
there and You know, yeah people are
[SPEAKER_00]: asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm gonna have seeds
man, you know When I have them at some you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, there are some there are some I did
give CSI a few things of mine a few a few
[SPEAKER_00]: select cuts that he's obviously like
released a few things I think he has a few
[SPEAKER_04]: more things in the pipeline who I know
about it Not so not so LA Cushcross that
[SPEAKER_00]: just happened to oh I you know,
I haven't talked to homie in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks So I'm behind him and I have been
meaning that I don't know if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: but he I think what's happening too is
that like he's kind of a Pain in the ass
[SPEAKER_00]: to get excited about certain things and so
you can be like, oh you want to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you'll be like,
oh I want to do that thing and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it'll start happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has moods And I think those are
lights took a while to get pushed like
[SPEAKER_04]: that because he doesn't like Stuff
typically associated with Dutch stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that's gonna smell like old Dutch
stuff and then yes He's got his
[SPEAKER_00]: prejudices, but he also lets the plants
talk to him and he's willing to be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised and I think now that he's used
the LA in a couple of things and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten some really positive responses from
lots of people it's made him more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in seeing what else it can do
yeah, so You know, I don't think Shanti
[SPEAKER_00]: Baba would be one of the most unusual
people to collab with he's not much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborest with anyone like that I don't
know if he's ever done a collab with an
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be pretty far-fetched Yeah
That would be pretty far-fetched You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Yeah, but they I mean so, you know as
always we try to keep it like light and we
[SPEAKER_00]: try to go in different directions you know
on that aspect, but You know, we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of There's a lot of interest
in old seeds right now and old lines and
[SPEAKER_00]: if a bunch of people could get 90-sensey
work or 90 serious work or this or that
[SPEAKER_00]: they would Jump all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah You know You know, hopefully some
of that stuff survived and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst the wave of bullshit There's
actually a few real gems That come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think a lot of people Really
really missed the fuck out when pips weed
[SPEAKER_04]: offered silver pearl like people who are
into old dank Unique legit shit when pips
[SPEAKER_04]: weed released that silver pearl We talked
about it a lot because it was one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite it still is one of my favorite
things to smoke But there are times when
[SPEAKER_04]: people do drop these old gems that they've
kept forever and people just for one
[SPEAKER_04]: reason or another miss out So make sure
you guys are keeping your eyes peeled
[SPEAKER_00]: today I think I think pip was just like
two years too early I agree like if he was
[SPEAKER_00]: if he dropped it last year like in 2021 or
something like that and he had some
[SPEAKER_00]: because the crazy thing about pips silver
pearl Is that like you look at that you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at a picture of that weed and you
hold it up to old silver pearl pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, is it a ringer?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a dead ass man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really really looks like you know,
if not this I mean, I'm not saying it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plant but You can really see like
it's a very close resemblance and his
[SPEAKER_04]: death coast like for people if you would
release death coast now If that clone made
[SPEAKER_04]: it around it would smoke every I in my
opinion it would smoke most sours It would
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke most burp rubber stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it was some of the loudest weed I'd
ever ever entertained.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that shit Yeah, I mean he's he's
got you know The cool thing about him is
[SPEAKER_00]: he breeds what he loves and he's got some
pretty cool lines and he also got a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky Yeah, you know a couple of times and
he's gotten unlucky too You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he tried to he tried to reverse his sour
cut and I think he got like 20 seeds Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, so that's exciting, you know and You
know silver pearl to me this is kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual smell but like silver pearl to me
smells like baby poo It smells like it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like it smells like little kid poo
and they're just living on milk when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very young before I know you don't
know that smell but I've had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: kids So it smells like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this weird it has one of those
smells that like smells gross,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because it's weed it's good That's so
weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smell like I hit a bubblegummy squeak
and the rest is like dang Indescribable
[SPEAKER_04]: thing like my nose smells just
indescribable day with like sweet pleasant
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum Yeah, it's it's pretty leafy and
it's and it's pretty very it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty and it doesn't be old that very big
buds It's insanely resinous for its era.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insanely resinous for its era.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like It's uh What is the exact
cross again?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's like is it early girl by
nl5 by skunk one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah early pearl nl5 skunk one Yeah,
that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they cross he crossed that just
haze see and made silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But yeah, especially that death coast
There's some things that pip did and he
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't like a fanboy on ID And he didn't
have this massive following but if people
[SPEAKER_00]: would have like bought him out The way
they bought some more well-known breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably would have been happier all
that money you spent on other people Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: hope you enjoy your animal mints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it remind you of the smell of
shoreline?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it didn't to me Shoreline like I
said, the indoor was very hot garbage.
[SPEAKER_04]: The outdoor was very hot garbage and and
legit urine Somebody just asked what's
[SPEAKER_00]: early pearl Maya?
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of early pearl is early
pearl is a worked early girl, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that Holly which is Pollyanna
cross with Early pearl I believe is
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollyanna, which is a Mexican cross with
early girl, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's and it that's what it is and it's
worked stuff from Rob Clark Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Pollyanna came from Rob Clark the
early the early girl, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Pollyanna came from Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the speculation that The Afghani
and I think it's the Afghani and or the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexican and Pollyanna might be the Mexican
at skunk one That's the one thing we are
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's there's some I mean,
I'm sure that Sam and him know You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, he he was responsible for a
number of early strains that went over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam I believe he brought over Calia
Calio, maybe California orange and You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, but there was a there was a handful
of there was a handful of people That were
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing things to Holland and he was
certainly one of them Yeah, so But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's no doubt that Rob and Sam in
the in that we're working with Mexicans
[SPEAKER_00]: and Colombians Trying to get Colombians to
finish in California Yeah And so they were
[SPEAKER_00]: working with various and that makes sense
because that's like the two most important
[SPEAKER_00]: things in that area at the time Yeah Go
ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's asking about Dolores.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna go grab a picture of Dolores
I don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't have it close.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the other room It's in the other
room And there's a guy there's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: guy in here that I chat with buckshot hill
whose family Was rocking a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: early pearl cut in the in the early 90s
And has been hunting Through any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed he can to try to see if he can find
something that he remembers from that era
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a nice early Early pearl cut in San
Diego too in the hog group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so So yeah, you know some of that
some of that early work some of the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know is really nice And I wish it was
still around for I mean there was an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to this gentleman from
Australia Okay, who worked with Neville?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the last years of Neville's life
Yeah, and he said one of Neville's great
[SPEAKER_00]: regrets is that he couldn't take all the
stuff he had in the 80s and 90s and
[SPEAKER_00]: working now Yeah With like, you know 30
more years experience and a better sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of things and a better sense of the
importance of things in certain aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a really good job back then
Yeah, but I think a lot of breeders have
[SPEAKER_00]: that regret where it's like boy Do I wish
I had everything I had in the 90s and
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I have a lot more
knowledge now Smoked a lot more weed seen
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more things talked a lot more so,
you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and And yeah, so That's that's early girl
and you know, I wish that we could get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was real But I think those times
passed sometime by the early to mid 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree People asked how did they go
downhill so fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened to sensei is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They I think they were legit all
throughout the 90s even after Neville left
[SPEAKER_00]: They still had most of their original moms
and dads And they released some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that were like unreleased Neville work in
the later 90s anyway, and then the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: changed They got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they lost some things And then
they outsourced to Spain That was the big
[SPEAKER_00]: death now So at that point who I I
actually believe that there could be one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two things amongst You know the their
collection that might still exist Super
[SPEAKER_04]: sober haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the ones that did get
everywhere in state, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but which ones are they and which ones are
legit and which ones from who knows I
[SPEAKER_00]: Think they've been untrustworthy for at
least 15 15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sadly Unfortunately, yeah,
but they had a good 10-year run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know from the early 90s to the
early 2000s They had a lot of legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff Yeah, so I would say I would be very
suspect of anything from sensei today and
[SPEAKER_00]: the shame is that Ben Matt and I have
talked a bunch about having Ben and Alan
[SPEAKER_00]: are Because they were there and they know
an enormous amount about the early history
[SPEAKER_00]: of Dutch cannabis But they are Very Dutch
businessmen and we've been told that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're terrible interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they still claim to this day
they have all the original parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei is no different now than it was in
the 90s And all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They promote sensei Yeah, you know,
they're not really interested in In
[SPEAKER_00]: history or being accurate or telling you
what they lost or what they have or what
[SPEAKER_00]: they like So they have it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't give a shit Keeper seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done a whole episode or two on
Canadian seed banks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably do some more it just
involves getting more of the Canadian
[SPEAKER_04]: people involved because Me and not so I
have no place telling the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada seed banks because yeah,
we do have we have a we have a good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: We chat with all the time that's from up
there that has a lot of connections and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of knowledge You know Matt talked to
To a couple of beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Red and chimera, you know There's some
other friends of theirs that might come on
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point But yeah, it's not really
our scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and and Shawnee's gonna be probably
Interview we had an interview with a dude
[SPEAKER_04]: named Pete from up there that was also
part of their scene But sadly we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have the audio anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone else has it and we can't get it
back So we're probably gonna do another
[SPEAKER_04]: interview again and just try to hit it
from scratch Shawnee's gonna help a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: with that because Shawnee's our Canadian
connect Someone just asked what about the
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes that are revamping the SSC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had a big interview with Corel So
the guy that used to own the company is
[SPEAKER_00]: still alive and still a part of it And I
believe you know, he's in his 70s now
[SPEAKER_00]: probably so it's I would imagine his son
and some other people are doing a ton You
[SPEAKER_00]: know And it doesn't seem it certainly
doesn't seem like they have a ton of their
[SPEAKER_00]: original stuff So they're trying to revamp
things but it does seem like they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: few at least one But possibly a few very
old cuttings Yeah, that they're using sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of as the baseline to get restarted again
from their work in the 80s Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that was a great interview,
too I remember after that was done We were
[SPEAKER_04]: just so stood like because it was special
like nobody had really done a great
[SPEAKER_04]: interview with SSC In many years many many
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So well, if you haven't heard that stuff
go check it out The other thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: liked a bunch too was that obviously they
talked about how they didn't have any um
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very upfront about quite there was
he was very upfront about most of it There
[SPEAKER_00]: was a few things where you know time or
whatever you didn't want to speak to it
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but he did give some really cool
tidbits that we didn't know before and he
[SPEAKER_00]: added depth and he was certainly there So
all that stuff I think that interview
[SPEAKER_04]: probably had the most bombshells in it
that we've done Of things we didn't know
[SPEAKER_04]: that were unknown to most of the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really cool Yeah,
so he's so he's part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's part of the of the revamp They're
certainly not gonna be able to like just
[SPEAKER_00]: release their old catalog like it was in
the 80s But they do have some old things
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're mixing them with other stuff
and we know when I interviewed him He
[SPEAKER_00]: seemed like an older version of us Yeah,
he seemed like a cool cat, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into him He was a nice man.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anything else you want to cover
tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting right there You know,
we are we are getting right there I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else I wanted to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if there was anything We can
save We can save, you know Some of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know for a later date or whatever I
suppose Now we have some notes written
[SPEAKER_00]: down and things and there's you know,
like as always There's a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that the questions and things that I see I
try to pick out some out of the comments
[SPEAKER_00]: If we didn't answer them, it's not because
it wasn't a good one It just didn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: with the flow of what we were chatting
about, you know So don't so you can always
[SPEAKER_00]: ask us on the discord or you can always
DM, you know or anything like that and so
[SPEAKER_00]: You know keeper topics keeper topics are
hard because It's personal preference What
[SPEAKER_00]: I what I consider a keeper you might not
consider a keeper We might have different
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria the big the biggest criteria that
I would say for a keeper for you is Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy the the flavor of the high and the
way it burns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are like, you know,
do you like if you personally like it a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it could be a keeper, you know If I
don't like the flavor of something even if
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the high it's not Very likely that
I'll keep smoking it for myself,
[SPEAKER_04]: but some people may prefer the high over
the flavor So that's why it's very I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's it's the easier to a
keeper becomes easier when when she checks
[SPEAKER_00]: all the boxes Yeah, you know, I mean
grandpa used to say there's nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with rich and beautiful, you know But you
know, so obviously if you have phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: high and incredible flavor That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, there's plants I keep That
don't have a very potent high but have
[SPEAKER_00]: other aspects that I like quite a bit And
there's there's the reverse too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've talked a bunch about that
that That peacemaker that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the great white shark cut that I had
that was almost hallucinogenic It was so
[SPEAKER_00]: strong, but it tasted like smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't find a good one that had any
flavor So, you know, all right So if
[SPEAKER_04]: you've enjoyed the talks tonight,
