[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was like I was connected
with everything around me All of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started questioning everything I'd
ever been told You know by the time I got
[SPEAKER_00]: high that very first time When it started
to hit me And I'm like well I got high
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a got got dude her skirt from up
north or cut upon it
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up everyone welcome to breeder
syndicate I'm Matt my co-host and friend
[SPEAKER_04]: not so that's me And we are here with pips
weed from souvenir seeds a very good
[SPEAKER_04]: friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been putting together for a long
time Long long like four years into making
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been wanting to do something and
Finally, we're getting to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of our most requested shows so
I'm stoked to finally have you sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: here with this pip and Have you
interacting with me and not so and
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody can hear some insight into the
Ohio strains and what you're currently
[SPEAKER_04]: doing with your career So let's start at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start talking about one of the One
of the clones that held your interest the
[SPEAKER_04]: most when you first started growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was circulation?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean when I first started growing it was
just I had gotten random clones from a few
[SPEAKER_05]: different people They weren't really
anything special.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something orange really
low-yielding That's what I ran for my
[SPEAKER_05]: first several grows and it was kind of
depressing but it was better than nothing
[SPEAKER_05]: because I had a good smell and it was you
know decent smoke at least for me at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time, but the main ones You know,
I would say probably like when the lemon G
[SPEAKER_05]: and the death star came into my life was
like really when I saw like the full
[SPEAKER_05]: potential of like good quality cannabis
and And it's it really fascinated me so
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of like gave me the oomph to
take it to the next level and take things
[SPEAKER_05]: seriously and and I did and I you know
grew those for a long time for over a
[SPEAKER_04]: decade straight and How early into your
like smoking like from the age of where
[SPEAKER_04]: you started smoking to where you started
growing Like how long did it take until
[SPEAKER_04]: you started getting like death star
quality type weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, so when I first started smoking I
was probably around 13 and I was just get
[SPEAKER_05]: I got weed from this kid at school and he
stole it from his dad and sold it to me
[SPEAKER_05]: for You know $20 I paid him in rolls of
quarters.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stole from my my parents closet or
something like that, you know And smoked
[SPEAKER_05]: it and I didn't get high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the first time I really ever
smoked weed I never really got a buzz and
[SPEAKER_05]: then Later on, you know, I would you know
High school came around, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we had access to the swag basically the
seeded pressed Mexican stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's different varying levels of
that Some were actually surprisingly good
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff that wasn't really compressed
and had the nice mature seeds in it a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of lime green stuff like that too,
we call it the Christmas trees,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there was good stuff as well,
but I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say probably my sophomore year of
high school is when I discovered what we
[SPEAKER_05]: called at the time kind bud Yeah,
KB And it was in Akron at a college party
[SPEAKER_05]: and one of my smoking buddies and good
friends I've known for a long time came
[SPEAKER_05]: downstairs and showed me this I was out on
the porch and he showed me this bud He's
[SPEAKER_05]: like look at this KB row and I'm like what
the hell is KB like I'm looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like it's weed And I said I looked at
it and smelled it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like you gotta be kidding me,
dude That's confusing going from
[SPEAKER_04]: compressed to seeing like Your first
actual right bud like well-grown manicured
[SPEAKER_04]: like you personally bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, so at that point I had already
been selling stuff for a while I did
[SPEAKER_05]: through high school and stuff just to make
extra money We you know, I didn't come
[SPEAKER_05]: from the wealthiest family in the world by
any means so it's kind of in a You know
[SPEAKER_05]: growing up situation was kind of every kid
fend for himself after a certain point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I Did what I had to do to survive and
make money?
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's how That's what I did for a
while and then eventually, you know after
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean senior year I did I grew some
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew my first plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah outside my parents backyard way in
the back and I planted them late and they
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't gonna finish in time and I knew it
so I dug them out of the ground and Put
[SPEAKER_05]: them in pots and brought them inside and
put them in my closet to finish out like
[SPEAKER_05]: the last You know three weeks or whatever
they need.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I line the whole closet with tin
foil black light black lights in there
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was looking back it's just
hilarious but I was worried I was gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: get caught my mom wasn't super mean but
she would She would look my ass probably I
[SPEAKER_05]: thought yeah used if she found them and I
had harvested it eventually and then like
[SPEAKER_05]: Months later, maybe a year later.
[SPEAKER_05]: She told me that while I was at school she
was watering it because it was about to
[SPEAKER_05]: die that whole time ever told me and My
mom was a gardener too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up growing all kinds of flowers and
planting gardens at our house and other
[SPEAKER_05]: people's houses So that's kind of like,
you know, we're I got a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: green thumb before the whole cannabis
thing so I understood how things work and
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and you know how to water and how to
feed and you know What a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_05]: looks like and what a sick plant looks
like and all that kinds of stuff how to
[SPEAKER_05]: prune them And then I never heard that
story about your mom that's She's a sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: lady she's been put through hell over her
life But man, I can't even picture my
[SPEAKER_04]: grandma being like I'll just take care of
the thing like, you know, that's pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad Yeah, so I would say
what was it probably right after right
[SPEAKER_05]: after high school is really when I
started, you know growing pretty good and
[SPEAKER_05]: I you know, probably three four years
after that I I'd say 2005 six seven ish
[SPEAKER_05]: right around those years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started getting a lot of really good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved up to Akron and I Met a friend of
mine who is still a really good friend of
[SPEAKER_05]: mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know each other for a really long time
He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Jay and he shared a lot of
really nice clones with me he shared the
[SPEAKER_05]: above a cush He shared the lemon cheese
the Afghani mango the Death Star the sour
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel Those were like the main ones,
you know, we've had different things over
[SPEAKER_05]: the years and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very early at that Time to be
getting clones like that too for people
[SPEAKER_04]: listening that aren't aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually pretty early to be Having
access to stuff like that in in random
[SPEAKER_04]: circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good connect I had the Indiana
bubble gum was around at that time One of
[SPEAKER_05]: the very first ones I ever got is one that
99.9 of the you know percent of the people
[SPEAKER_05]: listening aren't gonna know what it is
unless you're local, but it was called
[SPEAKER_05]: when knocky some people say who knocky and
It was pretty frequent early 2000s around
[SPEAKER_05]: this area being sold and a lot of people
around here remember it so that's one I've
[SPEAKER_05]: had in my collection, you know since
probably 2005 like It's a it's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like Jack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've done a lot of research it might
I don't know what it is I feel like it
[SPEAKER_05]: could be like J1 maybe or I don't know it
came from it was a big A lot of the big
[SPEAKER_05]: Asian crews around this area Ran that it
was a it was a big one And it was
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere but this was back in the day It
was for a short period of like a two or
[SPEAKER_05]: three years that I remember our group
getting it consistently Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got was that a TV queen Yeah,
it was it was pretty yeah, it's like it's
[SPEAKER_05]: it's tealeen But it's got like that
funkiness that fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but fun kind of like thing in it
It's a beautiful it's a beautiful plant I
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't it's those kind of plants aren't
my favorite to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the turpentine stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah But I've had I keep it because I've
had it for so long and I do enjoy the
[SPEAKER_05]: aromas that come from those plants I do I
mean I enjoy the looking at them and
[SPEAKER_05]: growing them and seeing the different
colors and you know Yeah, so I keep it
[SPEAKER_05]: around and I throw it in the flower room
once every couple years and do a nice one
[SPEAKER_05]: of it And lots of friends or something,
you know But if you're a sativa person,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's You know, it's a good plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just super nostalgic Yeah for if
you're from around here and you're around
[SPEAKER_04]: in those times So we have that we have the
one would you when not key We called it
[SPEAKER_05]: the knock the now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's easier the when knocky that
we didn't want to mess around with the
[SPEAKER_05]: pronunciation We just called it the knock
the not that wasn't like that was just our
[SPEAKER_05]: friend group.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't like everybody You know,
that was just us we referred to it as the
[SPEAKER_02]: knock so that's one of the really
interesting things about weed that I like
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch is that how like especially it
seems much more So in America than other
[SPEAKER_02]: places Every crew is insistent on giving
all these different strains They get
[SPEAKER_02]: little nicknames and then amongst that
little crew it becomes like just what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: known by you know, and so these different
strains at different times can take on
[SPEAKER_02]: different lives and You only know what
your friend gives it to you as so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like when you're best around girlfriends
You know it can start off as that and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it turns into the knock and then it turns
into this and then you know and It's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting because sometimes you don't
make those connections unless you know
[SPEAKER_02]: someone that knew it by both names,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, okay, it can happen,
you know I mean, we definitely have seen
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that like we think it's one thing
and we'll probably talk about that a
[SPEAKER_02]: little later But we think it's one thing
and then lo and behold it turns out to be
[SPEAKER_02]: another You know what we think we think
it's another and you know, I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: originally from the Midwest to although
I've been in California a long time now
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's kind of interesting how the
Midwest works in the sense that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: much less like trendy it was basically
like is as Pip was saying it's like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: got something better than Mexican it was
better than Mexican and It wasn't there
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't competition for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the desire for something better than
Mexican was huge So any kind of kind bud
[SPEAKER_02]: you had went any kind of we called it dank
You know, we used to call it nuggets and
[SPEAKER_02]: the reason why we called it nuggets is
because Only nuggets were uncompressed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you had the shape of the
bud the nugget itself, you know And so it
[SPEAKER_02]: looked like nuggets where it's like most
other stuff was compressed that even if it
[SPEAKER_02]: was lightly compressed it still changed it
But if I can stop you so, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we had some nice stuff every once in a
while You were running around nice stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: but a lot of the homegrown stuff back then
was a little bit creamy a little bit moist
[SPEAKER_02]: still, you know And then we have my town
anything better than Mexican was kind But
[SPEAKER_02]: right right same here like if it was
messed up if it wasn't dried the right way
[SPEAKER_02]: or cured the right way if it was creamy
There wasn't competition for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was still more people that wanted it
than there was it So it just went
[SPEAKER_05]: Beasters, I mean Beezers was kind bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Mean it was kind bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you guys remember that that stuff
went for the same ticket went for fifty
[SPEAKER_05]: and eight You know some people play
charging more I mean if you had it if you
[SPEAKER_05]: knew a guy who knew a guy you get the $40
deal but you know straight up It was 50
[SPEAKER_02]: bucks an eighth when it first hit the
funny thing about about Beasters in Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: is like they're really bad Beasters they
sent to the parts of America that they
[SPEAKER_02]: thought had no competition and Then the
parts of America they thought had a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more competition from outdoor or
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would send like a different grade So
depending on what part of the country
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in sometimes there was some stuff
that was actually pretty damn good For the
[SPEAKER_02]: time and then there was some stuff that
you were like, ooh Now I will say Our
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadian watchers have wanted me to to say
Remember, they only sent their crap down
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah We stirs they're like just remember
we had good shit We just didn't share with
[SPEAKER_02]: y 'all we could chat about we could chat
about that later, too But Pip and I have
[SPEAKER_02]: had some long combos about there's certain
strains He has that he even likes them
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of fermented And you know and what I
mean by that is that a lot of times
[SPEAKER_02]: Beasters because Let me think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it wasn't cured that great It
was still had some moisture in it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd seal it in a freezer in a freeze in
freezer You know seal a meals and ship it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it would get no air exchange for a
couple of weeks until somebody cracked it
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of that Beasters would ferment
and I remember having conversations with
[SPEAKER_02]: Pip about that and he was like man,
you know, there's a couple strains that I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually do that intentionally to Because
I like the fermentation process which is
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like that African Cob work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah the fermentation stuff You know,
it seems to me like a lot of the gassier
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff that I run it does it really well
like the Death Star You know you cure that
[SPEAKER_05]: at a super high humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my notes somewhere I forget it's
like I put it keep it in like a buck five
[SPEAKER_05]: gallon bucket with the screw top lid for
75% humidity or something like that for a
[SPEAKER_05]: while and a look and and not a cold area
though You want that warm air to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like get that process going I feel like it
takes a little bit longer If you keep it
[SPEAKER_05]: in a cold area, but it does good with with
a lot of the gassy stuff the Death Star
[SPEAKER_05]: Death Star s ones I did it with it was
really good I think star dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've done it with before lemon G
It is I love the lemon G when it's done
[SPEAKER_05]: like that when it's like slightly
fermented like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's uh, I like it fresh, too I like it
both ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you know, what's your
preference?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different, you know, just slightly
different but the hash People know too
[SPEAKER_02]: like when we talk about fermentation If
they're unfamiliar with it a lot of times
[SPEAKER_02]: curing happens on the stem and if you trim
stuff up kind of quick And it still has
[SPEAKER_02]: some moisture content going on and you
start to some people call it burping You
[SPEAKER_02]: know all that that's basically like light
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm If you're true if you've got fully
trimmed work in a bag or in a in a five
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon bucket Like he's talking about and
it's not ready to smoke yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of fermenting it in a way
Mm-hmm in my opinion at least yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you definitely got a burp It too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just throw a bunch of wet weed
in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's called molding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah You don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a fine line.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a fine line It takes you a while
to figure it out for each strain and like
[SPEAKER_05]: all that but in the time frame and all
that but you know I just keep it in room
[SPEAKER_05]: temp and and it's done pretty good versus
like in a colder area stuff like that
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a that's a complex process
and I'd imagine a lot of failure On the
[SPEAKER_04]: way to figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, honestly it was is by accident
really You know in my earlier years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just you know left some stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just it did the process by itself I did
I guess I just left it in a bag or I left
[SPEAKER_05]: it somewhere and I would notice every time
I did that that stuff that was a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit more moist and sat upstairs in a bag
after a couple months or whatever taste it
[SPEAKER_05]: was like it was a little bit darker like
it was like like degrading, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but and it wasn't as loud but it wasn't
like with the Death Star it was like sweet
[SPEAKER_05]: it like loses its gas a little bit and
becomes like sweet and And it's just I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean, it's super smooth smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way smoother than like smoking a
fresh bud out off of a plant or something
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember smoke was super it's it was
thick smoke Yeah, I mean for a minute
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff super thick cloudy smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh nice thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you looked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay I didn't know I got the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's uh, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy it It's not something I'm gonna
smoke all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, you know, it's like a fine wine
it's just it's cool smoking and getting
[SPEAKER_05]: that sweet flavor and like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you gotta you gotta try it to
understand it and that that's also
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's interesting I think too
about like the era we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: where information didn't exchange as fast
and a lot of times like when I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: like how I cure and stuff it was kind of
like you dry things and sometimes it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: well and sometimes it doesn't and Then
sometimes you learn things good and bad by
[SPEAKER_02]: accident on right how you treated it,
you know And that's kind of what it sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know You put it up there you put
it in a bag and all of a sudden it did
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing You weren't expecting and then
you're like, oh, well, how did I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start playing with like what you
did to make it do that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, oh does it work with this other
strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this drain doesn't like it at all But
this strain boy, do I like what it does
[SPEAKER_02]: when it does that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, and I think that's kind of cool
because you know a lot of times one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cool things about growing in the Midwest
is that Because change was slower back
[SPEAKER_02]: home people grew the same strains for
longer There was there was less turnover
[SPEAKER_02]: where like all the Sudden your customers
are like, oh, this is bunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need something new No, yeah,
that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah You get what you what's there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's what it is And so as a
result of that sometimes Midwestern
[SPEAKER_02]: growers really got to dial in certain
strains Because they had a long
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship of success by being able to
grow them And it's also we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: that soon Some of this some of the stuff
that you know that pip has in his
[SPEAKER_02]: collection Is pretty rare nationwide
because there wasn't pressure to move on
[SPEAKER_02]: to a new thing You know, there was various
clones and cuts getting passed around
[SPEAKER_02]: locally and they did well locally So they
had their own they had a life of their own
[SPEAKER_02]: almost We're in California, you know
populate, you know popularity changes and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden everyone dumps something
and just moves on to the next new thing
[SPEAKER_02]: right You were able to I mean you were you
were telling us, you know death Star and
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon G like were the better part of a
seven eight year run for you in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: success, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I I ran them hard hard for you know
At least eight years, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I kind of brought new other
strains in I was still running lemon G and
[SPEAKER_02]: dust are so So over that over that time,
you know, you know Especially with indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: where you get to do a number of rips a
year You really get to learn how the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: likes to grow how big to get it What size
pots how to feed all that type of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really like you really get to
it's like a long-term relationship You
[SPEAKER_02]: really get to know your partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so right, man It's uh, you know,
it took me I'd say it probably to fully
[SPEAKER_05]: master lemon G consistently Especially on
a bigger scale, you know took me probably
[SPEAKER_05]: a solid four or five years You know,
and that was at the beginning of when I
[SPEAKER_05]: started growing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nowadays it's not as difficult but It's
a finicky plant it's not something that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can throw in with a bunch of other
plants and expect it to you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: do well you got to kind of like Give it
its own environment its own everything
[SPEAKER_05]: like lemon G doesn't like a lot of light
It doesn't like a lot of heat like
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis plants in general don't but lemon
G especially I raised my lights up to do
[SPEAKER_05]: crops and it flourishes under you know,
25 watts per square foot like really
[SPEAKER_05]: really low lighting That's half of what
suggests I believe they suggest what 50 60
[SPEAKER_05]: watts per square foot for generally
speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm So and that's what I've been
running for most of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it's it's I like that I get good
quality off of it and It keeps the heat
[SPEAKER_05]: down because I don't have to have a bunch
of lights packed in somewhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know But it keeps the turps A lot of
times one of you know, you do two hotter
[SPEAKER_02]: lights on the top foot foot and a half of
your plant might look gorgeous but it
[SPEAKER_02]: might have some of the turps burned out by
the Intensity and like actually the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottoms tend to smell and taste better So
you can get away with less light more of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant brings out some of that subtlety
I guess and in my area we've always I
[SPEAKER_05]: should mention we've always had low
ceilings the houses low basement ceilings
[SPEAKER_05]: in the houses around so You've actually
seen before so I was kind of a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people around here use 600 waters and
that's What I've used pretty much since I
[SPEAKER_05]: started I've used thousands before but 90%
of what I've done is all been 600 watt
[SPEAKER_02]: lights, so Yeah, well Amsterdam had the
same thing when I first started going
[SPEAKER_02]: there they were all four and six hundreds
They thought thousand watts were crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: American stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So now that we're on to lemon G,
let's talk a little bit one about the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics of lemon G and the history of
lemon G and the terpene profile of lemon G
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's Really like I think I mean
what most people find really exceptional
[SPEAKER_04]: about lemon G is that flavor smell all
that goodness My first introduction to it
[SPEAKER_04]: was on the forums, you know, there was
there was some speculation about it being
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk misty Something, you know,
there's some speculation g13 hash plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you found out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well there yeah, there's you know,
I've been told a lot of things over the
[SPEAKER_05]: years I've been married to a lot of
theories Different theories over the years
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah And you know A lot of a lot of what
you read is not the case Some people are
[SPEAKER_05]: close, you know But I was able to get the
story from a friend of mine who worked for
[SPEAKER_05]: the lady who made it I'm not gonna mention
her name sure but she is local to you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, the state that I'm in and and she
told him that it was Lemon it was I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: sorry skunk misty crossed with some g13
now the g13 This this lady got as seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: from I believe from a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think she ordered them Yeah,
I don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea Could g13 skunk g13 hash
plant g13 and I'll show you how many g13
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses was there, you know, yeah knows
But that's you know, and this is a good
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my my my really good buddy who He
wouldn't bullshit me or anything like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So That's what she says.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from her mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's I guess what she's always said So
just to kind of clear that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the stories add on the lemon
cheese as far as what it is I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly what year It was made I would
assume it was probably somewhere in like
[SPEAKER_05]: the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah That's kind of like what I feel but
I've never really gotten an exact date on
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So And the turk profile, how would you
best describe the flavor of G third or
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon G?
Sorry?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemon lemon G lemon G is very very Very
lemony Yeah, not hardly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean no no turpentine or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you notice any Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can't pick it up if there is any
Lemon and lemon rind and lemon Mm-hmm It
[SPEAKER_02]: leans lemon astringent Yes, you know like
it doesn't have a lot of sweetness on the
[SPEAKER_02]: back end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like a very pungent lemon Let me
stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me stop you sir when you grow it like
crap.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets that very it's that very like
Rindy bitter almost smell but if you if
[SPEAKER_05]: you grow that plant good it comes out like
sweet sugar candy lemon G I'm telling you
[SPEAKER_05]: there's it's a finicky plant and most
people get rid of it because they can't
[SPEAKER_05]: they can't get it to perform right they
just get that like basic version of it
[SPEAKER_05]: like Frank like he was just talking about
so yeah, just get that basic version and
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have a hard time with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, it took me several years
faces as we both realized Oh, we only ever
[SPEAKER_02]: grew it like shit I have a thing with
citrus where like, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a Range there from like spraying
mouth like cleaner into your mouth To like
[SPEAKER_02]: a little like I tend to like the sweet
back end because it balances the
[SPEAKER_02]: astringent, you know And it's one of those
things where for me like I love citrus But
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to have other things need other
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't have citrus be my only weed Yeah,
you know when I describe lemon G I always
[SPEAKER_04]: tell people it's like a lemon came into a
bean form like a human Form and then
[SPEAKER_04]: pissed lemon into your mouth That's about
how I can describe lemon G.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so lemon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I it's it's very unique to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I've seen a lot of plants and I was
lucky to get that planter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so lucky to get that planter Yeah,
I mean that I can't believe it but it's so
[SPEAKER_05]: it's still to this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so unique There's nothing that I've
ever seen really that smells like lemon G
[SPEAKER_05]: like lemon G does that didn't come from
lemon G like when you pull lemon G out and
[SPEAKER_05]: you give it to somebody that's never
smelled it before I don't care who you
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your eyes are lighting up like you're
like, what is this, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: It just blows you away and it's a good
buzz indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's decent outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: That plant is magical I love the buzz of
that stuff outside and I will only smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: lemon G if it's grown outside Wow It's
just so much better in my opinion But I
[SPEAKER_05]: grew it indoor most of my life and it's
still good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still good It's a it's a light buzz.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's 100% All my female customers
over the years request It's the number one
[SPEAKER_05]: requested for some reason the ladies
absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps it gives them energy They clean
on it, you know and all that stuff so So
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, it's been it's been pretty pretty
popular with the females as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you um, have you tried lemon tree?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or lemonade yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't I've heard lemon tree smells a
lot like lemon G, but I tend to think that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're related some way It has to be a
lemon G.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say has to be yeah in my opinion Yeah
Another thing I wanted to mention is my
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy mentioned that he had smoked my same
good buddy again that he smoked The g13.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a g13 skunk Back in the day and he
said that's the closest thing he's ever
[SPEAKER_05]: smelled to lemon G.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like very spot-on but it was just
kind of mild So I thought that was a kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of interesting, you know thing and then I
know a lot of people are gonna ask about
[SPEAKER_05]: what's the skunk misty as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and honestly, I haven't I I wish I
could tell you it's probably They have a
[SPEAKER_05]: strain called misty back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't they Nirvana or somebody Nirvana
Nirvana seeds and not to be confused with
[SPEAKER_04]: your people always confuses their water
with gypsy Nirvana whenever I say no Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: so no Nirvana seeds had a misty and I
can't remember off the top my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't Remember what it was nl something
And so basically everything in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_02]: then that wasn't from Neville or a few
other breeders almost everything was was
[SPEAKER_02]: something by skunk one Pretty much,
you know, so having something that was
[SPEAKER_02]: misty by skunk one in the 90s That was the
most common hybrid in Amsterdam was
[SPEAKER_02]: something by skunk one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because skunk one was just consistent,
you know, and I actually can kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: that the g13 Straight cut that you had pip
I can kind of see skunk and g13 in that
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon G You know, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean lemon G is kind of like it's kind
of got that This is this is like people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't take this the wrong way,
but it kind of has that like ugliness to
[SPEAKER_02]: it You know, we're like there was an era
where like we didn't have to be pretty You
[SPEAKER_02]: know and lemon G definitely has kind of
that like g13 like weird bud Formation
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf formation, especially look You know
and then you know from skunk one some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of citrus coming through is pretty common
So I can see you know It's been probably
[SPEAKER_02]: the skunk one probably took the g13 from
being leafy in a mess and made it Gave it
[SPEAKER_02]: that nice running cola that probably made
it such a good cropper for you for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time, you know and Yeah, I I saw you know
the lemon G for the longest time or let me
[SPEAKER_05]: start by saying actually first there's a
g13 clone that's gone around this area for
[SPEAKER_05]: a long time since I was in school still my
parents my friends parents grew it and my
[SPEAKER_05]: other friends parents grew it and
Eventually, I got it and that thing is I
[SPEAKER_05]: thought for sure that is what was used for
lemon G because you could smell That in
[SPEAKER_05]: the lemon G like it's obvious you could
smell that plant in the lemon G It's like
[SPEAKER_05]: okay these both came from the same state,
you know They're they smell related.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably related.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just always figured that's kind of
what it was But and I don't know what that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a with that g13 plant I don't know if
it's an airborne g13 cut from the forums
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure It's just a short little
stubby Afghan It's not really like it's
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing really a lot of people would
prefer to smoke or grow these days I feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's more like your head stash unique
old-school Afghan II type of yeah type of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff But like a little soapy a little
like it's been a while since I smelled it
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost it, you know when I went through
that whole dudding scenario,
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately, I It's just one I've never
been able to get back I've been trying
[SPEAKER_04]: several times right like people have given
you stuff back and it turned out not to be
[SPEAKER_05]: it I mean, I think maybe once with the G
but okay The cheese pretty easy to spot
[SPEAKER_05]: like if you get a clone of that and it
veggies up a little even a little bit You
[SPEAKER_05]: know, you might even be able to tell from
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's a really unique plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow Short squat little Afghan II,
but we can talk about that a little bit if
[SPEAKER_05]: you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I used to talk about it and when we
were looking he would send me pics and we
[SPEAKER_02]: would always kind of like wonder Is it
like is it airborne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Pacific?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something more ancient than that
that like survived it where he's at and I
[SPEAKER_02]: will say that like if you look at some of
the Neville's few pics that he put up of
[SPEAKER_02]: the classic G 13 clone It kind of had that
like gnarly ancient Afghan II ugly look to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was very similar for lack for
lack of a better term That's not dissing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, there's plenty of weed
that I think is kind of ugly that I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually love to smoke Kim 91 that ugliest
plant ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the ugliest plant ever but it's
on earth No, there is definitely some haze
[SPEAKER_02]: that I find that I find attractive that is
way more hideous Nah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're like, oh this thing
doesn't have any crystal doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's loose It's calyxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bullshit, you know, and then Yeah,
I curse but we're in the middle of it
[SPEAKER_02]: We're after a minute in But maybe so that
we chatted about the lemon G for a second
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we chat the other thing you got
early that you really love which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Star?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, which is a classic It has a
great name and it's been consistently one
[SPEAKER_02]: of your favorites basically from now to
then it really hasn't shifted Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah the Death Star Is my all-star I've
loved that plant since the day I got it
[SPEAKER_05]: the day I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so happy the day I got it You know,
I only had probably at that point like 10
[SPEAKER_05]: or 12 plants in my collection and it just
completely Kicked them all out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: water, you know I like that that hardcore
like potency like knock you down put you
[SPEAKER_05]: into the couch type of stuff and And
that's the effect you get off the Death
[SPEAKER_05]: Star but you know, you also get the super
crazy Like oniony tennis ball like rubber
[SPEAKER_05]: gas like skunk like nastiness Everything's
there and you grow it killer people don't
[SPEAKER_04]: understand like I've had shitty Death Star
Like where it's grown to where there's not
[SPEAKER_04]: very much burnt rubber at all where it's
more of that oniony Spicy back end and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just not very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I've had your Death Star where it
just kicks its ass So when he's describing
[SPEAKER_04]: this if if if it smells different than way
he's describing it Because he's grown it
[SPEAKER_04]: very very very well for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So go ahead continue please on the Death
Star Okay, I guess where do I start?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll start at Team Death Star,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah They're from Ohio Columbus area and
they are the people that created the Death
[SPEAKER_05]: Star the Death Star is a cross of Sensi
star and sour diesel and They it was an
[SPEAKER_05]: accidental pollination I guess And they
had a couple seeds and they sprouted them
[SPEAKER_05]: and they picked the Death Star and one of
those few seeds that they sprouted Was
[SPEAKER_05]: this amazing plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was so lucky I was so lucky to get
it in the mid-2000s at the time when I had
[SPEAKER_05]: you know only been growing for four five
years or something like that and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: just so Intrigued by this plant and how
potent it was and how much yield it put
[SPEAKER_05]: out so I just Started putting it in all my
rooms basically that I had that I had
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering and I just started growing it
and growing and growing it and it's I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people at my door pitchfarts,
you know three weeks before harvest like
[SPEAKER_05]: where's it?
[SPEAKER_05]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was it was scary It's just it's
just it flew off the shelves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah And I enjoyed I was smoking it all
the time But yeah, so that came from from
[SPEAKER_05]: them they got the the sour diesel Cut they
got I think came from fish show in Vermont
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in like I forget the date.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 2004 I think fish did like a
farewell show at a airport in Vermont and
[SPEAKER_05]: And they picked up I don't know if they
picked it up in Vermont or if they picked
[SPEAKER_05]: it up back along the way from Vermont to
Ohio But along that trip is when they
[SPEAKER_05]: acquired that and then from what I've
heard of another friend of theirs and went
[SPEAKER_05]: to Amsterdam and got seeds and came back
and I guess they were grown and Selection
[SPEAKER_05]: was made and that was given to team death
star by a friend of theirs And then that's
[SPEAKER_02]: how the cross got the death star got made
Okay One of the things maybe I should
[SPEAKER_02]: mention because it's like a long-term
running joke, but it ties in to what Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: and Pip We're just discussing is that You
know it it takes probably a good 84 days
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, you know, I mean that's that's
about that's that's what I push it to like
[SPEAKER_05]: you can pull it at 77 days I mean a lot of
people told it 70 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where a lot of people make that's
the point I'm gonna make is that one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the differences and one of the reasons why
it might be so good from Pip versus other
[SPEAKER_02]: people is That you know, he was willing to
actually see like how long does this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: need to go before it hits perfection and
what happens like and this used to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: with sour diesel a lot in California is
that there's people that would grow it
[SPEAKER_02]: until it hit the sweet spot and There's
people that would grow it Until it hit
[SPEAKER_02]: good enough for market and there's a vast
difference that like say you might be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to cut off like he was just saying if you
cut that start 70 it might fly out the
[SPEAKER_02]: door, but not be as nice and Pip would
take it an extra two weeks and it would
[SPEAKER_02]: reach this extra level and I think the
same thing would happen with sour out west
[SPEAKER_02]: It would happen with some other cuts where
it was like there was croppers were like
[SPEAKER_02]: as soon as it had the nose and was good
enough to go It's time to cut it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a lot of people that don't
like taking anything over nine or ten
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks You know and sometimes not with
everything sometimes you go downhill but
[SPEAKER_02]: with some things if you give it that extra
week or two It makes a huge difference You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it lets the potency and the flavor
and some of the depth come out and You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, so I think when Matt was talking
about all this Death Star sucks There was
[SPEAKER_02]: probably a lot of Death Star that was cut
at 10 that Needed to go 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there was a lot cut at seven
Earlier you cut it, you know the less
[SPEAKER_05]: nuance and depth it'll have so yeah One
thing else I wanted to add too is when
[SPEAKER_05]: this Accidental cross happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it actually pollinated some
other plants as well They had the Indiana
[SPEAKER_05]: bubblegum, which was a clone I had at its
time as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was popular around here And they had
the dumpster which is a popular one from
[SPEAKER_05]: You know back in the day around here and I
think those were both pollinated Because
[SPEAKER_05]: when I was at you know, the festival
Nelson Ledges in you know, the mid-2000s I
[SPEAKER_05]: was seeing these strains called bubble
star and dump star Yeah, I think there was
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe one or two more that I can't recall
right now But I definitely remember seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of the bubble star I remember the
Death Star was a little bit difficult to
[SPEAKER_05]: get and I think the Sensi star was a
little bit difficult to get as well I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't think it was Just like lots of it,
you know, yeah kind of like You mentioned
[SPEAKER_04]: dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mentioned dumpster Ohioans are
gonna want to hear about dumpster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you rep Ohio's dumpster for us?
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is dumpster?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it smell like a dumpster?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it really found in a dumpster?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's I haven't heard from the
horse's mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of things over the year
and it's it's all Generally lines up,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know things get left out over the
years things get added I guess so take it
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever I say as is but Supposedly it was
there was a couple of guys growing
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is known as the professor and
I was told that they basically had a
[SPEAKER_05]: falling out and They were they were
growing this plant and then they had a
[SPEAKER_05]: falling out and they threw this whole room
away into a trap the one guy threw the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole room away into a trash can or
something and then the other guy went back
[SPEAKER_05]: and got the cut that they were growing out
of the dumpster and Called it dumpster All
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I mean that's that's just what
I've heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know there's more details I do
have some connections.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can get more details on that from but
you know, I think What did I what did I
[SPEAKER_05]: say it kind of it kind of reminds me of
like the there's a garlic bud pick and
[SPEAKER_05]: Never seen that but what is it 1989?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the seed bank, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of reminds me a lot of dumpster.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really It's it's almost dead on that
leaf and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks, you know, just like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah So I've heard people say it's you
know, Shiva skunk, you know and I'll five
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk one I mean there was a lot of that
sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean definitely possible
interesting part just real quick before we
[SPEAKER_02]: get up on that tangent is that at the seed
bank Neville called this line garlic bud
[SPEAKER_02]: and Then when it and then when the sensei
seeds sold the same line when they bought
[SPEAKER_02]: his company They called it Shiva Shanti,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know and so there could be some truth
to both It could it be, you know Pippa and
[SPEAKER_02]: I have chatted about it does very much
look like sort of an old nl skunk It does
[SPEAKER_02]: a hybrid of some kind You know,
what does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the turf profile?
[SPEAKER_05]: I Classify it is like it's like a sweet
Pineapple with like that toe jam funk.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a funk in it too,
you know That's kind of that's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like where I lie with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's It's good smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's decent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's I mean to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just average smoke It's a commercial
just typical like a commercial type
[SPEAKER_05]: variety a lot of people did a lot of grows
of dumpster in Ohio over the years and Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, because it yields like crazy,
but It does get big buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit prone to mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to watch out But overall it's I
mean it's a staple in Ohio it's been
[SPEAKER_05]: around for 20 years or whatever now,
so There was a there was a fake one that
[SPEAKER_05]: went around Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think really mentioned it in his books.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called chumpster With a CA with a
CH chumpster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I personally never saw that one,
but I just figured I would mention it It
[SPEAKER_05]: was mostly run in Toledo back in the day I
believe at first and that's like we're
[SPEAKER_05]: like the professor and all that stuff was
but I've also heard people say that There
[SPEAKER_05]: was a guy in Columbus And that's where
this whole situation happened as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just not a hundred percent sure but
that's kind of where I'm at with the
[SPEAKER_04]: dumpster Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, how about the Afghani mango?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's another older classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man the Afghani mango Yeah,
yeah, I got that I got that around again
[SPEAKER_05]: around mid-2000s from my buddy I was one
of his favorite ones and I remember going
[SPEAKER_05]: over to his house one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was living up in Akron and I walk in
and I smell this smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like man that smells I mean that is
really unique with what are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like I'm smoking Afghan mango and he
was smoking it out of his volcano
[SPEAKER_05]: vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh nice He gave me some puffs and I smoked
it and the flavor was Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like this like soft mango a
little bit of Sweet for sure a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of like metallic smell in there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like yeah It was just super
interesting and then he you know brought
[SPEAKER_05]: me upstairs and showed me like two or
three lights and upstairs bedroom a little
[SPEAKER_05]: window AC or something in a fan and He had
he had it growing up there and it was just
[SPEAKER_05]: such a unique looking plant I mean,
I'd really never seen anything like it up
[SPEAKER_05]: until this point I was growing a lot of
like kind of more like Indica dominant
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff Whereas the Afghani mango is
definitely a little bit more sativa It
[SPEAKER_05]: makes these long spears that kind of like
aren't thick but they fill in they're just
[SPEAKER_05]: like long spears and And I ran it for ran
it for quite a while, but it could be
[SPEAKER_05]: finicky It does this weird thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll stunt out sometimes like kind of
like fail to start and then it also if the
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions aren't perfect it can tend to
like herm a lot or like if one plant in
[SPEAKER_05]: the room is like by the fan constantly
getting beat up the whole time like it
[SPEAKER_05]: could herm so I never really did large
runs of it it's been a commercial Ohio
[SPEAKER_05]: strain for a long time lots of people have
done big big runs of Afghan mango and pass
[SPEAKER_05]: it around the state over the years and
stuff, but it's Just it's a super unique
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've you know, I've seen Angel's breath
and I think I've told you before Matt by
[SPEAKER_05]: mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice and angel heart and that and it kind
of looks very similar to that But I know
[SPEAKER_05]: you've mentioned to me that those are
relatively recent releases within the past
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 11 years Yeah, and I've had the Afghan
mango for you know for longer than that
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously, so yeah Yeah, I guess that
would you know that would kind of nullify
[SPEAKER_05]: it but I don't know 100% Super unique
plants been around Ohio for a long time KC
[SPEAKER_04]: 33 maybe always an option KC mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah the KC brain stuff Yeah,
you know that's older and I mean it was it
[SPEAKER_04]: was grown a lot because it was one of the
more affordable lines But there was great
[SPEAKER_04]: great stuff in it like amazing stuff in it
a lot of breeders ended up knocking it off
[SPEAKER_04]: later on to BC's BC mangoes based on that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a look into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Might be another direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I thought I've talked to a lot of
people You know a lot of local people
[SPEAKER_05]: people in the wheat game over the years
and I always ask about Afghan mango
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's one of the ones that I have
the least information about Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who made it I don't know if
they made it if they bought seeds of it
[SPEAKER_05]: from a company when it came around It's
definitely, you know early to mid-2000s
[SPEAKER_05]: areas where I would put it put that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to ask Konza where he sourced his
seeds see if he has any kind of Anything
[SPEAKER_04]: on it You ever talk to him about it No
Yeah, I'm here to ask him.
[SPEAKER_04]: No Okay, so we go from the we haven't done
four way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we I?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't believe we have let's hit four way.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right the the four way I Had I had
originally gotten a plant back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: food.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the exact date 2014 15 16
somewhere around there probably I had
[SPEAKER_05]: gotten a plant from a friend of a friend
and it was called sensei star and I Grew
[SPEAKER_05]: it and I realized I had smoked this before
you know, but I couldn't it's been so long
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't tell you know, like is this a
sensei star I smoked or you know So so I
[SPEAKER_05]: had grown it for years and I had liked it
and I after growing it a couple times I
[SPEAKER_05]: really noticed a lot of similarities to
the dust star because I've been growing
[SPEAKER_05]: dust are forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah It kind of has that like little
zigzag structure it does and some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: aromas in it as well kind of Kind of are
very similar So, you know, I actually
[SPEAKER_05]: thought for a long time that it actually
was the the plant that was used to make
[SPEAKER_05]: dust our pot sure But recently I found you
know, I was wrong That's the star.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown death star s ones I've
definitely seen the s1 progeny and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty pretty clear now that they are You
know sensei star dominant So I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's related the the four-way my cut what
you know is related somehow whether it's
[SPEAKER_05]: part of sensei star or a Component of it
was used to make sensei star or something
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, you know, yeah so that's kind
of like that's kind of where I where I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: at now with with that I Grew that sensei
star for years and then eventually along
[SPEAKER_05]: the way I had gotten plants Under
different names such as it's that were the
[SPEAKER_05]: same plant as my sensei star I got it
under the name of death star from some
[SPEAKER_05]: people I got it under the name of four way
from the guy I got it under the name of
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all this different stuff and
every time over the years I grow it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh my gosh, it's the same plant
again Like why this is the one that you
[SPEAKER_04]: kept getting back is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Yeah, it was crazy So, you know fast
forward several years after that a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I was looking I reached out to a friend
Of a friend who had a friend Who said that
[SPEAKER_05]: they had the Ohio four-way clone that used
to go around?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I I get in contact with them I go over
to his house and he's a super cool guy a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit older and he shows me a jar of
the flower and and I kind of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know saw the resemblance I was like
almost like this is that same plan again
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wasn't sure and then he took me
downstairs into his little hut and he had
[SPEAKER_05]: like a light with like, you know three or
four Blants and they weren't in the best
[SPEAKER_05]: shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some thrips on them and stuff But
it just wasn't the best representation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wasn't a hundred percent sure yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so So anyway, he you know,
he gave me the cut and I brought him some
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff too because he's from a small circle
He doesn't have access to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sure I gave him some cool stuff to grow
and I went and you know grew this thing
[SPEAKER_05]: out and When we were talking and smoking
his flower when I met up with them He told
[SPEAKER_05]: me that he's had it for 20 years and that
one of his buddies was a guy that bought
[SPEAKER_05]: The seeds and made the selection back in
the day Wow Yeah, and he originally said
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the guy that I met that I got the
cut from so that it was from sensei seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had him actually contact his buddy
the guy who and he confirmed he said he
[SPEAKER_05]: got him from Nirvana Oh interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, so, you know Nirvana's
description is slightly different from
[SPEAKER_05]: sensei seeds But you know, they did a lot
of work with other people's lines back in
[SPEAKER_05]: the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't Be surprising to me if it
was more than likely just sensei's work
[SPEAKER_05]: that they were using.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's probably the most you know
You know and Nirvana was probably I
[SPEAKER_04]: probably would have bought Nirvana's over
sensei's during You know during those
[SPEAKER_04]: early era that early era because Nirvana's
was always like $90 whereas sensei's was
[SPEAKER_02]: like 240, you know, there's a right
Nirvana verifiably took various lines from
[SPEAKER_02]: sensei and Reprode them and making and
gave them their own names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they famously took Neville's nl2
and called it Oasis That's the passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was it was very common Yeah,
and all that and then one thing we
[SPEAKER_02]: probably should mention about the about
the sensei star itself Is that even though
[SPEAKER_02]: it came out in 1995?
[SPEAKER_02]: We still don't know what the heck it is,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been extremely reluctant to mention
Any parentage as far as the guy who owns
[SPEAKER_02]: paradise?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what else I found interesting
was in 95 since he seeds Re-released the
[SPEAKER_05]: four-way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they mean by that But in
1995 they did and then a year after in 96
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe was when paradise started and
released the sensei star, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what was actually released pretty
pretty close together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I don't know I mean can't prove
anything, but you know, it's just like I
[SPEAKER_05]: said, it's possible That that four-way was
used or that one of the components that
[SPEAKER_05]: make up four-way was possibly used,
you know And that's coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: expressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah was was Afghan tea and four-way It
took a long time for us to figure out and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it was one of those things that was
hiding in plain sight where Neville wrote
[SPEAKER_02]: in his 87 update to his catalog that he
was about to release this strain called
[SPEAKER_02]: four-way And it was big bud and l1 by
early pearl skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and And so it was another one of
those things that like Pippa and I and
[SPEAKER_02]: others we hunted and hunted and hunted
forever Looking for any information on
[SPEAKER_02]: what would actually the makeup was?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was one of those things that
was just like hiding in plain sight if you
[SPEAKER_02]: knew where to look And so it was honestly
one of those like the 90s was a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: f1s, but that was an early poly hybrid You
know because I believe I believe Neville
[SPEAKER_02]: released both of those plants that made up
four-way as separate strains big bud and
[SPEAKER_02]: l1 just became the big bud line and Early
pearl skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe got released as early skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm You know, so it was already lines
He was playing with separately to begin
[SPEAKER_02]: with and then he took two of them and
combined them together Yeah, and there you
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so obviously as a four-way hybrid It
could lean in different directions and
[SPEAKER_02]: especially amongst the progeny and stuff
like that, but Yeah, so I wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: clarify today if you go on their website
since he sees labels it as Indian by
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghanistan by Pakistan by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't I don't know when this was
released It's not in any of their 90s
[SPEAKER_05]: catalogs But they did use in 1987 Neville
did the up Senate update for his 87
[SPEAKER_05]: catalog, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he was gonna you know have a
four-way hybrid the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: He comes out with four and more And that's
the only year it comes out and then two
[SPEAKER_05]: years go by 89 and 90 and it's not in the
catalog and then in 91 since he sees comes
[SPEAKER_05]: along and releases four-way and They use
the same exact description that Neville
[SPEAKER_02]: used for his four and more Yeah,
therefore same same finish time same
[SPEAKER_02]: verbiage and the description to all that
type all that type of stuff So yeah clues
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, you know And you know,
I mean we don't know like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's up there's some other famous cuts
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Fairfax Four-way that
supposedly was from the same line But you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, obviously like if you get a four-way
hybrid it could lean in a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: different directions, you know,
right one thing I wanted to pull on real
[SPEAKER_02]: quick because I wasn't clear on it when
you were talking about the The the the
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble star and some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Was that made with death star pollen
or was that made with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pollen from maybe like the East Coast sour
diesel that threw on some of those other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants It was the sensei star that threw
it was the sensei So the sensei star was
[SPEAKER_02]: the was the the dad if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes that the sensei the sensei star
through The sensei star through okay So
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where that's where bubble star and
some of those other hybrids you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about that you would see floating
around came from Yeah, it definitely came
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it definitely came from that
same accidental pollination or it I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: say accidental I've heard that they saw
that the sensei star was kind of making
[SPEAKER_05]: pollen and they kind of used it and
Sprinkled it is what I've heard as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, I believe early Early
feminized seed used to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know You know straight, you know plant
gets stressed Accidental pollen flies and
[SPEAKER_02]: then all of a sudden you have some
feminized bag seed Right long before we
[SPEAKER_02]: figured out STS or any of these other
methods that moderate where you're using
[SPEAKER_02]: in modern times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm you know, I don't know Matt smiling
over there or whatever but But yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know for old people like me We
used to think that that accidental
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination Like if you use that you were
cheating and it would probably ruin the
[SPEAKER_02]: line because it was made not the natural
way That was a big belief back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big belief You're like,
oh you're gonna use some herm accident
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff You're gonna probably like imprint
that into your seed line and you'll never
[SPEAKER_02]: get it out And it'll be worse So that just
goes to show how ignorant we were at the
[SPEAKER_04]: time we were convinced, you know,
huh, yeah the other day Caleb made a post
[SPEAKER_04]: and It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely nuts when I see this but it's
the typical what I call the typical hippie
[SPEAKER_04]: response to like a feminized seed post is
like ha see like it was it was CSI posting
[SPEAKER_04]: about a reversal failure right now like ha
Cuz cuz you were you were messing with
[SPEAKER_04]: nature as well What what happened there
and then I had to point out, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they nature wants these plants intersects
It's because man's intervened that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually Actually, if you really want
to get technical they're taking it back
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's just like this really bad logical
argument that they seem to have in their
[SPEAKER_04]: heads that Herming is us being bad With
plant weed used to be very bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah There used to be a lot of bro science
and what I mean by that is just stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: gets passed around and smoking circles and
stuff like that And I mean I've talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about it on previous shows where we used
to put our best Mexican, but in the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: chamber So it would gain quality But in
your resin chamber, you know until the end
[SPEAKER_02]: This but out you thought that was an
improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of misinformation In
the 90s and early 2000s when the internet
[SPEAKER_02]: and and sort of like, you know facts It
was basically just a bunch of kids
[SPEAKER_02]: Spreading what they heard from older
people maybe or reading in high times,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know We used to think high times was
sort of the Bible They are and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: get older and you're like, oh man who
takes that advice?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a real era in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So You know Yeah, so I mean four-way You
know it ended up being one of your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite plants It did man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's uh, it's it's just you know,
super unique super old-school You can tell
[SPEAKER_05]: if you've been growing growing a lot of
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow it and look at it and be
like, yeah, that's definitely Not from
[SPEAKER_05]: around this time period, you know
Definitely some like 90s weed something
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't really growing or smoking in the
80s So I didn't see a lot of that stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've seen enough stuff from you know
back in the day to know when something's a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit older and you know different
Then would you say would you say that the
[SPEAKER_04]: the four-way the Ohio four-way is skunky
at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes That's interesting because that the
Fairfax four-way like the one time when I
[SPEAKER_04]: got to because it was super dutted when I
got it but The one time I got to like get
[SPEAKER_04]: any hint of smell out of it You could
smell like what direction it was going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh wow This does have potential
to be as skunky as they've talked about it
[SPEAKER_04]: really does so I was wondering if the
other it's cut does it's I don't know the
[SPEAKER_05]: the four-way that I have is it's not as
skunky as like the Death Star,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it doesn't it's not like that
It's it's milder than the Death Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it's got more like other stuff
in it, you know, it's like that like I
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know how does that old world likes
those old world smells, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like stuff like that ashy spicy You know
skunky Stuff going on in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely the one the other one Was
like had onion II in it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the other smell I could really
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah But there's some stuff about that
four-way certain things about it that
[SPEAKER_04]: remind me of stuff You'd see from Afghan
tea stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always found that interesting based
on what's in it I don't really see Afghan
[SPEAKER_04]: tea in it unless Afghan teas and spunk one
or something like that Which is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'd always like to dig further into
Yeah, I mean it it it was it was one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those confusing things for a really long
time Because Neville was one of the only
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that just sort of laid out what was
in his stuff All that second wave of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders pretty much intentionally
obscured Genetics which were like his
[SPEAKER_02]: people like us who are a little younger
younger than that and historians trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what they used Even 25 30 years
later some of those people don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: just come off it Like what would it what
would it matter if Luke came out and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and said this is what I used to make
Sensei star in 1995 Like big secret can't
[SPEAKER_02]: let that out, you know, like and but to
this day it's still kind of like What's
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know as of this year as recent as this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will not say unfortunately I'd love to
have him on to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we've been getting declined
That's that's been around Robin and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's one of those things where for a
lot of people it's like if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit me why would I say it and it's
like do I want to say that I like ripped
[SPEAKER_02]: it off from Neville or I got it from this
other person that I never gave credit to
[SPEAKER_02]: or Whatever the story may or may not be
they'd prefer it to remain a mystery
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not like anyone's gonna go
and like find the parents 25 years later
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years later and like recreate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Mean that ship is sailed while we're in
this territory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hit my personal favorite the one
like the the the bud that made me fall in
[SPEAKER_04]: love with pips Grows the silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about that girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did she come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm the silver pearl Came from a local guy
that actually got a hold of me on IG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I met him I think we have a mutual
friend as well at the time and I I'm not
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna say either their names, but sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's that's who I received it from
Prefaces saying like our group has had
[SPEAKER_05]: this clone for a long time Back in the day
and I never grew it because I was so busy
[SPEAKER_05]: tied up with lemon G and death star like
that was my show as my mo So like I didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have time for anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I already had ten or twelve plants That
was more than enough for me being a
[SPEAKER_05]: cropper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah So I kind of always passed on I would
smoke it, you know, my friends would have
[SPEAKER_05]: it They'd bring it over and they'd bring
it to our little, you know Cannabis cuffs
[SPEAKER_05]: that we had and stuff back in the day up
here in Akron But I never really grew it
[SPEAKER_05]: and then as we got older, you know how
things go stuff gets lost it's not in the
[SPEAKER_05]: circle anymore and And I wanted to give it
a riff so, you know I was able to get in
[SPEAKER_05]: touch with this guy and he he had gotten
it from an older gentleman who lived down
[SPEAKER_05]: southern Ohio, I believe and Had it for
quite a while and then you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I eventually acquired it from him,
you know gave him some stuff see even I
[SPEAKER_05]: forget what else but It was it and a funny
story is like a week later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got another plant that I was looking for
I was looking for that g13 we were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about Earlier and now someone gave it to
me and I grew it up and I knew before I
[SPEAKER_05]: even flowered it It was silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got silver pearl twice in the same
week from or basically different people
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I'll say that's interesting
about that cut is that and not everything
[SPEAKER_02]: does this but that cut grown out looks
amazingly like some of the oldest pictures
[SPEAKER_02]: of silver pearl that you can find I mean,
you know, you don't want to use the word
[SPEAKER_02]: dead ringer too much or anything like
that, but boy Visually, does it look like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's just you know, just walked out
of the catalog and into your collection It
[SPEAKER_02]: really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like if you were to look at hips
silver pearl cut and you were to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those old pictures of silver pearl
and You didn't know which was which you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: have a hard time telling the difference in
some ways It really looks it really it
[SPEAKER_02]: really does resemble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not proof or anything like that,
but it certainly helps right, right You
[SPEAKER_05]: know silver pearl is just such a special
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a narcotic hitter like I
prefer I respect all cannabis regardless
[SPEAKER_05]: of whether I enjoy it or not, you know,
I gave it all a chance I enjoy all the
[SPEAKER_05]: different aspects of it, even if I'm not
smoking it, you know Yeah, but but the
[SPEAKER_05]: silver pearl really grew on me when I
first smoked it I was kind of I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: Off put by it because I wanted something,
you know hard-hitting but after after
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking it for a while giving it a chance
and seeing what it's really about You know
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking it fresh when you wake up in the
morning You know nothing in your system.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just I mean It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really just really uplifting
motivating Happy, you know bright buzz on
[SPEAKER_05]: a you know, it's it's very more of like a
sativa It's almost like what you think of
[SPEAKER_05]: like a sativa, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But on a plant with this short and squat
and finishes in you know, 50 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's I call the high electric
maybe Not not in the sense that it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: giving you a rush but it's bright and
happy to me very bright and happy is the
[SPEAKER_04]: best way I can describe it and the descent
profile like me and not so describe it
[SPEAKER_04]: completely opposite and And it's really
just two different takes on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's because of how complex it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh I have a description.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote of it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to remember some but it's the
basic smells or it's it's like a It's kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of like a sweet melon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a little bit of baby poo in there
like that funk It's got no like the funky
[SPEAKER_05]: funk foot funk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess a little bit type thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got Some like anise like almost like
a black licorice type of you know thing So
[SPEAKER_04]: so those are kind of not so loves the
anise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, I know like yeah, I see you for
me when I smell it I smell like pink
[SPEAKER_04]: bubblegum is the first smell I smell and
oh, yeah D just grew it outdoor and I
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled it and I smelled it again in the
first smell I smell is pink bubblegum But
[SPEAKER_04]: then there's like funky skunk background,
but not yet white.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just yeah It's got so much going on
Matt that confuses a lot of people a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of people have a hard time really like
nailing it Because there's just so much
[SPEAKER_05]: there's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like some of these There's just
so many different I mean you can sit there
[SPEAKER_05]: and smell it for ten minutes straight and
and pick out all the different it's Just
[SPEAKER_05]: really really unique really awesome,
you know short flowering indica Like I
[SPEAKER_05]: said 50 days not the biggest yielder in
the world You got to defoliate it a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit, you know, like yeah, he throws fan
leaves everywhere big fat indica and but
[SPEAKER_05]: it's got a great Yeah, got a great
structure and you don't even have I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think I've ever netted or staked a silver
pearl plant my life regardless of how big
[SPEAKER_05]: it's been I mean, I grew up into like five
gallons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't go bigger than that But you know
they it just so they support themselves
[SPEAKER_05]: like you know You don't even have to mess
with them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good outdoor stuff One of the things
that's interesting about it is that
[SPEAKER_02]: because pit mentioned it is that when he
says baby poo, I also get a strong baby
[SPEAKER_02]: poo smell off it but just to clarify like
it smells to me like infant baby poo like
[SPEAKER_02]: when all they're all they're on is
mother's milk like they haven't gotten any
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of real food like because I have a
number of kids or whatever so like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm familiar with That he's a
reader but there's a very different smell
[SPEAKER_02]: to baby poo when they're one two,
three four months old Whatever and all
[SPEAKER_02]: they're eating is mommy's milk,
right then when they get actual real food
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't smell like some kind of like
gnarly kid poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like this weird It's almost like
one of those things to me where like if it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't in cannabis you would guarantee say
it doesn't smell good but there's like
[SPEAKER_02]: smells in cannabis that smell weird,
but you like them, but they're in weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of caught that's skunky sweet
sickly Baby poo and it doesn't sound maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: that doesn't sound too appetizing but it
really is There is in the progeny There is
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit of mint and I could smell a
slight hint of it in the mom But I got
[SPEAKER_05]: some nice nice selections.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made that are like extremely like super
minty, you know It was it really,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know threw me off guard surprised me I
also think it smells like a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: some of them like Like a Melanie a melon
kind of you know It's just I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's got a lot going on man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what silver pearl is supposed to be
according to Neville is nl5 Female the
[SPEAKER_02]: famous clone crossed with a early pearl
skunk one male, right and that silver
[SPEAKER_02]: pearl I mean I go ahead and one of the
things since we were just talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: four-way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any proof I don't know how
many different males Neville decided to
[SPEAKER_02]: use of early pearl skunk one But it's
somewhat possible that it could have the
[SPEAKER_05]: same dad is four-way It's I mean
anything's possible man, you know because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it it's the same mix from the
same guy Yeah, it's you know, the dad is
[SPEAKER_02]: early pearl skunk one in both hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a different male?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely the same line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm, you know And that early pearl is a
early girl crossed with Pollyanna Yeah And
[SPEAKER_05]: that that's you know, that's what you
know, they used to cross I thought it was
[SPEAKER_05]: the nl5 and it had nl5 skunk one male I
had it written down like that because I
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't able to find exactly What it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's the same we have Good thing
we have our strain base coming out Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's specifically it's the nl5 by by early
pearl skunk one, you know, so it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: three-way hybrid silver pearl and what's
interesting Is since Matt and I have been
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of doing a deep dive on some of the
early girl early pearl stuff Is you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really realize it but secretly it was one
of the most common things Neville used
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout his lines He loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved that early pearl He loved he
loved mixing it into different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's it doesn't really get talked
about that much, but it was one of his
[SPEAKER_05]: favorites and Where did the early girl
come from Northern California?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and Pollyanna was huh, we just
recently found out That one of them one of
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember if it's early girl or
Pollyanna.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Pollyanna Maybe it was
early girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is not from Rob or Sam and I
always thought both were from Rob Rob
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's the there's a lot of
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early girl, I believe is a is an Afghan
Mexican and Then they took that and they
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed that To Pollyanna, which is an
early Colombian by Mexican and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: early pearl And we also learned that that
sweetness is very was very prevalent in
[SPEAKER_02]: the early pearl and it was one of
Neville's favorite things and He wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: recreate it really badly later in his life
because he enjoyed walking He really
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyed sort of that double Mexican Afghan
blend that was early pearl and that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: it should Showed up in so many different
hybrids he had and later in my trip later
[SPEAKER_04]: in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was working a specific Oaxacan line I
don't remember where he sourced it from
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was later, but He felt that that was
very similar to what he saw in the early
[SPEAKER_02]: pearl if I remember correctly And this is
there's a there's a gentleman that that
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt and I chat with on IG And he his
family used to grow early pearl in the 90s
[SPEAKER_02]: for about five years Up in my neck of the
woods and he's been kind of on the hunt to
[SPEAKER_02]: find he got lost in a bus sadly But he did
say if he sent me not knowing that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies He sent me this pic you had posted
a number of years ago of an early of a
[SPEAKER_02]: silver pearl s1 and He goes man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this look like my parents plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh boy, he did he did you know,
so Take that for what it's worth But he go
[SPEAKER_02]: but there was a that yeah, he showed me
this picture and it's from you You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's like this one really looks like
my parents old cut of early pearl So who
[SPEAKER_05]: knows, you know, yeah, you never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's it's it's it's pretty unique
plant Once you've been around it and
[SPEAKER_05]: you've seen some progeny you could kind of
tell You know what's related if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: related or not So I have no doubt that you
know, that's what he had and he thought
[SPEAKER_02]: that mine looked like is and it's also one
Of the rare things that pip doesn't take
[SPEAKER_02]: 84 days It doesn't take 84 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done before most of my plants are
even halfway done flowering 55 or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I mean you could pull it before
50 if you wanted to it's just it's it's so
[SPEAKER_05]: quick I feel like I throw it in the flower
room and feed it for two weeks and then
[SPEAKER_05]: you know So it's like it's basically like
a true seven-weeker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah super quick I mean some of them go
into the 50s, you know 55 days or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: but Some of the progeny was done in 46 47
days you could probably pull it 45 if you
[SPEAKER_05]: lived in 1990 like they always look at
yeah, you know You see these seed
[SPEAKER_05]: descriptions and flowering times and
you're like, oh, it's done in,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know 60 days and really freedom 35
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean It was the flowering time on super
skunk Just getting started on indoor and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing those 50 day strains and being like
I could get eight crops a year
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super enticing, you know,
you just thinking oh my gosh, I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: realize that it was a bit it was a bit of
marketing back then claiming everything
[SPEAKER_02]: took six or seven weeks, but You know it
and then I realized how rare it was to
[SPEAKER_02]: find something that developed that quickly
that I actually liked Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so we got through the ode to Neville.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to qq 36.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy Q 36 eludium q 36 is a wild one
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an exact date, but it's
somewhere like 2010 11 ish 2009 to 2011
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably put it So it's relatively
kind of like new kid on the block out here
[SPEAKER_05]: for Ohio and It's when I first got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in like 20 20 13 14.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know I'd have to look But it it
when I first got that thing, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking at the leaves on the thing
It looked like it was like came out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Jurassic period or something, you know
dinosaurs walking around so I mean super
[SPEAKER_05]: weird super dark Afghani like super unique
leaf shape and so I you know veg it up and
[SPEAKER_05]: I flowered it out and It's definitely I
could tell immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was definitely related to Bubba But
it's not like anything that I've seen
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed with Bubba before I don't they say
the lineage is it's basically Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_05]: cross with Hawaiian indica and there was
so there was some work done In that line
[SPEAKER_05]: they they had bred that line together a
second time they have twos or the DX twos
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever They did they had a plant
called the nuke that went around for a
[SPEAKER_05]: while and it was decent But eventually
that kind of got thrown to the side once
[SPEAKER_05]: they used the nuke to make the next
generation that you know the q 36 came
[SPEAKER_05]: from ultimately Yeah, and that thing just
blew everything out of the water So that
[SPEAKER_05]: nuke everybody kind of like threw that to
the wayside and just focused on the q 36
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like a Bubba Like a Bubba Kush,
but it's like cream like super creamy
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't have like
typical Bubba leaves it's got these short
[SPEAKER_05]: little like like almost like like Clover
or I don't know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're they're very they're just very
unique I have pictures on my Instagram
[SPEAKER_05]: page if you want to look The the resin it
put it just pumps out resin it I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: almost looks like a like a like one of
these hype strains that you see now It's
[SPEAKER_05]: just so caked up in resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the smaller plants don't tend to
yield too Well, but when I put them in
[SPEAKER_05]: like three or gallons or five gallons and
got them nice and veged up They do pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: good yielding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like creamy Bubba and anise like
that again like a black licorice type Like
[SPEAKER_05]: thing in there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's it's a low.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a low tester.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Like 15% I think my buddies some
people have had it tested a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: higher, but generally test below 20% But
it is there just like Bubba very medical
[SPEAKER_05]: very good a good effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely smokes like it's over 20%
The flavors phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said creamy Bubba Like if you're a
Bubba lover, like this one is the this is
[SPEAKER_04]: the ultimate it's like primo Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah It is Pip has shared it in our little
tight circle of friends And I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: almost universally Everyone regards it
almost as an improved Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know like better Maybe even
maybe even better than Bubba would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: way to describe it like, you know,
like everything they like about Bubba and
[SPEAKER_02]: more Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's how I would say it and and
more If you don't hit it right it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: really turn out well doesn't yield well
It's a little bit leafy and it can come
[SPEAKER_05]: out a little bit like soapy sometimes I
feel like so This plant there's none of
[SPEAKER_05]: that, you know, I mean even if you run it
bad, it's not coming out soapy It's not
[SPEAKER_05]: coming out crappy like it's still gonna do
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely like an improvement I
mean, I wouldn't call it above like a
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba cut, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's it's definitely like a newer age
version of like Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the fire Yeah improved improved
version of the Bubba so The only reason
[SPEAKER_02]: why I say that is because most people that
really love to grow Bubba for their head
[SPEAKER_02]: end up growing Q36 for their head and
being totally happy with that plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: not having to grow Bubba for their head
because they get everything they like
[SPEAKER_02]: about Bubba right and and a little bit
more from it So that's pretty high praise
[SPEAKER_05]: really and just to clarify a lot of people
get confused the the Illudium is the Q36.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's this it's the Q3 Illudium Q36 space
modulator It's the more the gun the more
[SPEAKER_05]: than the Martian used to use on the
cartoon So that's the full name is you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, Illudium Q33 36 space modulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go And what was it's there was a
weird breeding trait that I had were
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about seed making how it makes
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it doesn't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried to see the thing Numerous times
and the same thing happens I get you know
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 maybe if I'm lucky 30 40 seeds out of
each pound 30% of them are premature fully
[SPEAKER_05]: like big seeds But just white and hollow
and and then the other ones some are
[SPEAKER_05]: mutated and then you sprout what you have
left from that You know, whatever 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds you get out of that 15 maybe and you
sprout them and then some are are Like
[SPEAKER_05]: mutant like super mutant there's like
maybe 25 30 percent of them from what I've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen Yeah have been like mutant or run T
or slow, you know, and then a small
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage of them though are Are really
nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet so it's been it's it's a lot It's a
tough pill to swallow when you try to
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinate a plant and you got to rip apart
a pound of weed To get you know 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds that you can grow and then only a
quarter of those are gonna be Something
[SPEAKER_05]: decent and only a percentage of those are
gonna be something amazing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time you were done slicing and
dicing how much came out I was thinking to
[SPEAKER_02]: myself so he gets five seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: He likes I did cross it to the silver
pearl and I Grew those seeds and I did
[SPEAKER_05]: find an awesome selection a really really
awesome selection and it kind of made it
[SPEAKER_05]: worth it for me I posted on my Instagram
page.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's does it make seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely resinous Yeah Yeah, it does so
It's extremely resinous Maybe even more so
[SPEAKER_05]: than the q36.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just absolutely caked on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get that picture of me
[SPEAKER_05]: But I made two selections they're both
very nice one is just super unique it kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of has the I like that that like black
licorice like Like anise or I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: how you pronounce it but I like that and
stuff and I like it in the q36 and the so
[SPEAKER_05]: the so one of the selections I made has
it's kind of like a lot of that and less
[SPEAKER_05]: of like the other aspects it's kind of
like focused in on to it and it's not like
[SPEAKER_05]: The most ideal plants not a huge yielder
is kind of wiry But it's got good flour
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's got that flavor and that smell
and that taste that I like so I keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: around I Don't think a lot of people
understand that too when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: reversals is that Because there's other
things you've done to like with your East
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast soured diesel cut reversing it where
like it works But it doesn't really give
[SPEAKER_02]: you enough seed that you can like even
share it with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like you It it gives you 15 or
30 or 40 seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't Yeah, you can't make packs of
it It's like even difficult to share with
[SPEAKER_02]: homies because you get so few and it took
so much effort to do So there's just
[SPEAKER_02]: certain varieties out there that for
whatever reason don't don't Reverse well
[SPEAKER_02]: or don't take seed don't take pollination
Well, and it makes it really hard to make
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm You know now speaking of hybrid
making let's get into where you're at now
[SPEAKER_04]: where where you're at currently as of The
time this podcast is gonna air Where I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: at in my seed making yeah Well,
I am at the point where I have already
[SPEAKER_05]: made the rubber city and I did a rigorous
selection process trying to narrow down
[SPEAKER_05]: what I feel like were the best plants out
of that run and yeah, and and I've grown
[SPEAKER_05]: them and cropped them and and just done
everything I could to really like make
[SPEAKER_05]: sure they're what I want what I want to
use and and then I have I The one is the
[SPEAKER_05]: ten the rubber city number ten and the
other one is the rubber city number four
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe before you go any further just
talk for a second about what made the
[SPEAKER_02]: rubber city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sounds good and we'll go
forward from there Yeah, the the rubber
[SPEAKER_05]: city was the sour diesel reversed on to
the Sensei star at the time, but the
[SPEAKER_05]: four-way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah now and That's what would I created
the original rubber city with So that's
[SPEAKER_05]: then you hunted that a bunch so I grew out
probably mmm Right around 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the exact number I grew
out about 50 seeds of it and these are all
[SPEAKER_05]: males that you're not being all females
Yeah all females so big so and they are
[SPEAKER_05]: they it was just Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't have I couldn't have asked for
better results.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Ended up cloning about half the run For
backups just because everything was
[SPEAKER_05]: looking so good halfway through I usually
take my clones off the flowering plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know a small branch or something like
that Yeah, just so that they aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: constantly growing They're just revegging
in a stasis mother for a while until
[SPEAKER_05]: everything's finished.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah When you keep a lot of moms you kind
of have to write you have to figure out
[SPEAKER_04]: These little tactics to oh, yeah have
things outgrow each other and keep things
[SPEAKER_04]: in a stasis while being healthy at the
same time Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am so I Definitely selected about
half of them and then I did another run
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately after the seed run was done
just to double-check because some people
[SPEAKER_05]: may not notice this but see he plants seed
plants versus clone plants of the same
[SPEAKER_05]: exact copy of the genetic is and
Drastically differ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, you know, yeah, I mean maybe not
drastically but they can differ the good
[SPEAKER_05]: amount, you know, like Seed plants usually
tend to be more vigorous and yield more
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know, do you guys agree with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah and Hermes right, right,
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got the yeah So I grew out a bunch of
those I made selections a half of them and
[SPEAKER_05]: then I did about Probably four maybe five
rounds over the course of like a year and
[SPEAKER_05]: a half of narrowing it down I would just
grow, you know each grow I would narrow it
[SPEAKER_05]: down from like, you know half of them To
20 to 15 to 10 and like once I got to like
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember getting to like eight of them
that I had to choose between it was just
[SPEAKER_05]: like They were all so good that they all
would have been good, you know I had to
[SPEAKER_05]: like nitpick like this one This one
structure is a little bit floppier than
[SPEAKER_05]: this one, but they're all still fire,
you know, yeah super good So I just kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of splitting hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was splitting hairs So but
eventually I had I had narrowed it down
[SPEAKER_05]: after several different runs to the Rubber
City number 10 and the Rubber City number
[SPEAKER_05]: four go figure I would find two of my best
selections in the first ten seats,
[SPEAKER_05]: huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right, right Out of the first I
popped 15 and the number 20 was banging So
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody knows he resisted the urge to
name it Rubber City 189 His effort to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it seem like that, you know, so Yeah,
I mean it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not concerned With numbers,
you know, I post pictures people know what
[SPEAKER_05]: I do people know And we actually I
remember when you were doing those
[SPEAKER_04]: selections and like the first round you're
like, oh my god guys I don't even know how
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna cut through these let alone pick
one or two, you know Yeah, I remember I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean the other part of it that was funny
too was he would PIP would call me and be
[SPEAKER_02]: like so I smoked two or three examples and
I'm now ruined and I don't think I can
[SPEAKER_02]: judge anymore for a while because I'm
already so baked I kind of have to Chill
[SPEAKER_02]: out before I can try anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know cuz that's what happens to
it like testing a large number of things
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's like you can only test two
or three a day, you know Cuz you wake up
[SPEAKER_02]: and you try a few and then all of a sudden
your days changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, it's hard to keep a fresh
palate and a fresh head, you know It's a
[SPEAKER_05]: slow process to do it the right way You
got to do it over the course of days
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks, you know months if you got enough
stuff I guess right so I'll say one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'll shut up and let PIP talk But
one of the things I think that's cool that
[SPEAKER_02]: not very many people out here in breeding
do anymore but we have some friends that
[SPEAKER_02]: do is that they make a hybrid like Rubber
City and then they hunt the hybrid and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they select Favorites from that and
then they do further work Right a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding today is sort of one step one off
one and done you make it you release it
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there till it's gone And you know
what we're about to talk about right now
[SPEAKER_02]: is PIP You know, he made his some of his
favorite selections and then he he you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, he used those to make more things So
let's start off with Rubber Band The
[SPEAKER_05]: rubber band.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay rubber band is the rubber city
number ten So all this stuff on the on the
[SPEAKER_05]: rubber city drop is my rubber city ten
selection that I reversed so that would be
[SPEAKER_05]: the Rubber City ten crossed to triangle
Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I did that I named it rubber band
as it's supposed to be said all is one
[SPEAKER_05]: word kind of like headband rubber band
headband It's kind of my take on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Sour Diesel OG Kush the rubber
city ten is a is definitely more of a sour
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel leaning looking type of plant Even
though I consider it Multiple times better
[SPEAKER_05]: than sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll smoke it over sour diesel any day of
the week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah Yep So that's that's what the
that's what the rubber band is I did a I
[SPEAKER_05]: did a couple other ones I did the through
the chem D in there everybody loves the
[SPEAKER_05]: chem D and it's already got those those
funky dirty like, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: really really gassy and Skunky type of
like smells to it So I figured that would
[SPEAKER_05]: be a good one to throw against it and just
produce some nice yielders And that's
[SPEAKER_05]: called dirty rubber and that's gonna be
your that's gonna be the dirty rubber Yep,
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that name great name Yeah Yeah And
you have the the star dog you use the
[SPEAKER_04]: Corey Haim cut for rubber I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep Like I said in the description it the
I've always liked the star dog that star
[SPEAKER_05]: dog cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a high yielder I pulled off some nice
runs with it before it makes big flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: super gassy You know JJ did some good work
with Really good work with that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy that plant It's a great cropper
and it's still got gas and and it shares a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of similar traits with my rubber city
tennis You know, they're not the same
[SPEAKER_05]: plant by any means but they both are very
vigorous growing big they're that
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial style growth structure and
stretch and bud that you want,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like the colas and so I just I
figured, you know, they'd be fun to cross
[SPEAKER_05]: them together and And and see what kind of
craziness comes out of those things,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Yeah, and I see you have Some
rubber city back cross one and rubber city
[SPEAKER_04]: back cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah two different versions of the back
crosses I I cross the Sour back or the
[SPEAKER_05]: rubber city ten to the sour and I also
crossed it to the four-way So you kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: have a choice You can kind of pick
something that you're gonna want to live
[SPEAKER_05]: want to see a little bit more four-way
You're gonna see it wants something that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna see a little bit more Sour,
you know, yeah the Gold Coast hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right Gold Coast hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the Gold Coast hash plant Is my
rubber city 10 selection cross to death
[SPEAKER_05]: coast sister So some of you people are
familiar with my death coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes a lot of really good extracts,
especially solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's populous popular It's really it's
it's really the loudest shit I've ever had
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's it produces bunches of it So I
run it over my t-shirt screens and save
[SPEAKER_05]: jars of it and send it to Friends for a
while factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so that their wives can scream
at them and house house smells like a
[SPEAKER_05]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep So, yeah, but anyway the the death
coast was out of the the the BC one
[SPEAKER_05]: generation I did I crossed Sour diesel and
Death Star and made a selection and that
[SPEAKER_05]: was the popular one at the time,
but a lot of people don't know that I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: Made a secondary selection as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, which was definitely a more sour
type of looking plant And you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy it it was a little bit different
than death coast and I've been smoking it
[SPEAKER_05]: for a long time and Eventually,
I started I was making death coast hash
[SPEAKER_05]: and I said I'll make hash with the death
coast sister to this time and see how it
[SPEAKER_05]: does because every time I break it up,
you know something's hashy when you break
[SPEAKER_05]: it up for a joint and You see you can just
see it all fall onto the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah you move The pile of weed a
little bit and there's there's a line of
[SPEAKER_05]: hash left, you know, I just don't yeah
just dump so And I've always liked the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant So anyway, it just you know,
I broke that thing up and it was it was
[SPEAKER_05]: dumping big time big big time I was just I
just the smoke was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like I got to do something with this
thing This is this is too good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I cross it to my River City 10 and when
it was seated up Breaking it up when it
[SPEAKER_05]: was even because see see Seated plants are
you know notoriously thought to not
[SPEAKER_05]: produce as much resin, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You there yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah seated plants are thought to not
really produce as much resin, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well this thing dumped just as good if not
better Seated yeah as it does unseated and
[SPEAKER_05]: it was just I've got the pictures on my IG
You can see the gloves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just after every couple ounces two
three ounces Breaking it up with your
[SPEAKER_05]: hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gloves are just so caked that they're
falling apart and ripping like you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: switch your gloves and It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what is the death coast sister?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we would call like internally
the SD?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bx7 Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what yeah in our group.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what first the first name on the
label the sour diesel BX number 7 plant
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not not Bx7.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's number 7.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes Yep, so I've had that one for a while,
you know pride in one of my pride and joy
[SPEAKER_05]: I only I the flowers nice a lot of people
request the flower I personally prefer to
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke the hash over the flower same with
the death coast They're like it's just It
[SPEAKER_05]: just the flowers good, but I love I love
my hash and when I got a plant that that
[SPEAKER_05]: dumps like this You know, that's what I
that's what I'm using it for and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of what I created it for is For to be
like a hash plant, you know, I'm shocked
[SPEAKER_04]: at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I mean because you were
This is one of the cuts you were real open
[SPEAKER_04]: with about sharing yeah I don't know why
that this didn't hit the like boom past
[SPEAKER_04]: the hype market and just shoot to the top
because of dumps like for resin production
[SPEAKER_04]: Extracts how loud it is like some people
will smell this as straight-up skunk I
[SPEAKER_04]: think some people like I smell more burnt
rubber with that back end But to a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people this is gonna be one of the
skunkiest things they've ever smelled
[SPEAKER_02]: Strangely, I think the skunk comes out
stronger in the hash Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's for sure, you know,
and I think that happens with a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: amplified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah The skunkiness is amplified in
hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it really it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's uh, I Love my hash, man Yeah,
good hash, too What else we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see talk about the Premium rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, premium rubber is one of my pride and
joy creations that is both of my rubber
[SPEAKER_05]: City selections crossed together You still
there yeah, okay, so the four and the ten
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the four and the ten crossed
together and those are two my two favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I smoke really I you know,
I smoke silver pearl I smoke I throw a mix
[SPEAKER_05]: other stuff in but my daily smoke for the
past Four years has been pretty much the
[SPEAKER_05]: rubber City ten or the rubber City for the
rubber City number ten is more of a high
[SPEAKER_05]: You like higher yielder than the four like
as far as like bigger buds I shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean slightly higher yielder,
but it's bigger buds It's more along the
[SPEAKER_05]: sour side of the spectrum, but it's still
got all the gas and skunk and onion and
[SPEAKER_05]: rubber it's got all that stuff in it,
but It's like the high yielder.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like the all-star So I
look at that is like that my commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: the commercial All-star and then I have
the number four which is like my head
[SPEAKER_05]: stash all-star Even though I smoke them
both the same but the head stash one is a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit less sour diesel more like It's
got the sour diesel that's got all the
[SPEAKER_05]: gassiness all the skunkiness all the
everything but it's got a lot of Aromas
[SPEAKER_05]: and potency from the four-way cut So it's
got it's very very hashy like it burns It
[SPEAKER_05]: when you take a hit off a bowl and you set
the bowl down that bowl Just keeps burning
[SPEAKER_05]: a little trail of smoke off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you're smoking hash out of a
bowl, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but with just the weed it like
that's you know, and it Tastes like hash
[SPEAKER_05]: and it is just one of the most potent
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it right there next to the Death
Star You know, it's it's it's just you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, it might surpass it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so I don't know man It's my favorite
plant that that I've ever made and I've
[SPEAKER_05]: ever selected and I'll probably have it
with me till I go to my grave Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I'm still partial to the pearl but
this stuff for people looking for like
[SPEAKER_04]: those volatile sulfur compounds,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just special plant
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have no doubt people are gonna find
some extremely nice plants and all of
[SPEAKER_05]: this, of course, but especially the
premium rubber With that four being
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed in there You know the sky's the
limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean there could be some some serious
unicorns pulled out of that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think and So that's kind of one that I
that I really I really take a lot of pride
[SPEAKER_05]: in I like that one and then I have the The
last one would be the good year,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the rubber city number 10 s ones
as well Cross to it's crossed to itself
[SPEAKER_05]: and and those will be those will be
extremely high yielding They will be more
[SPEAKER_05]: along the lines of sour But a lot of them
are more the rubber city 10 is more it's
[SPEAKER_05]: more dense than a sour But it's not like
dense like indica dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just yeah not as loose as Like sour
is and and it's easier to grow sour is a
[SPEAKER_05]: finicky plant Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean you can grow it and get it to come
out Okay, but to get it to come out 110%
[SPEAKER_04]: like you really got it, you know,
it's really easy It's really easy to make
[SPEAKER_04]: boofy sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah I've seen a lot of bad sour that
was actually sour, but just bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guilty Yeah, I've done it before,
you know, definitely have myself But it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just sour is just such a tough plant And
that's kind of one of the reasons I wanted
[SPEAKER_05]: to do this is just because it's these
plants are I feel like better than sour
[SPEAKER_05]: and And they are easier to grow than sour
They're not as finicky and sensitive and
[SPEAKER_05]: all that kind of stuff And yeah,
I feel like, you know people say clones
[SPEAKER_05]: lose vigor over the years and stuff like
that I didn't have sour diesel in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what it was like back then
but Today it's still a nice plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: vigorous and it makes a good yield but
it's Gotten nothing on the on the River
[SPEAKER_05]: City 10 Like it's just this the reverse
like we were talking about how eludium is
[SPEAKER_05]: like the new by well Like the the river
city number 10 is basically like how I
[SPEAKER_05]: look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the new Upgraded version of sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the guys in our group are running
it like that, too Oh, yeah, they're using
[SPEAKER_04]: it and working into lines is their new
sour of bitter and crybaby in those guys
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah one thing maybe that I thought we
should we could mention real quick before
[SPEAKER_02]: we run out of time here is that the When
pip was just talking about You know some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these hybrids he actually did something
that I think is really cool and it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of it's actually super rare which is most
times when people make feminized hybrids
[SPEAKER_02]: they're either out crossing it to a
totally different line or they are s
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting it and one of the rarest things is
to Make feminized seed from two different
[SPEAKER_02]: examples from the same line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making something like the RC 10 by the
RC 4 is actually something that's super
[SPEAKER_02]: rare It's actually a feminized rubber city
line Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's for its further work and it's
one of the rarest things that you'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: on the market because almost all feminized
reversals like I said are either s ones or
[SPEAKER_02]: Out crosses to something different it not
line work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very little feminized line work in
a way so I don't know exactly Know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd call RC 10 by RC for like how you'd
exactly one are You know we call it What
[SPEAKER_04]: F1 are F1 reversal just F2?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, it's the second generation of
rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it's a it's a reversal It's in the
same line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's in crossing it in a sense,
too It's just it's a pure rubber city line
[SPEAKER_04]: F1.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not It's not an F1.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be an F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah F2R Yeah, F2R.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to point out that in in
in feminized seed It's that that line is
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the rarest things which it's line
work, but made feminized style It's not an
[SPEAKER_02]: out cross and it's not an s1.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not inbred It's you know,
it's two full sisters crossed to each
[SPEAKER_04]: other which doesn't happen that often
Yeah, I've seen it happen quite a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: lately I think people are finally starting
to catch on to stuff like that and if if
[SPEAKER_04]: my theory is correct about the super skunk
trade the Afghan tea trait being a a was
[SPEAKER_04]: it double recessive then every time you
Cross to the Afghan tea types together.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're reinforcing that trait and you're
getting those volatiles Sulfur compounds
[SPEAKER_04]: like just stack it and stack and that's
what I think's going on and Like this is
[SPEAKER_04]: that ultimate example of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean if you want Some of its parents or
some of its some of its rarest stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be in the line to pop up That would
probably be the line to look through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah Then like I said Matt there is
going to be I mean, I haven't done a ton
[SPEAKER_05]: of that line yet I've just done small
populations but the you know, eventually I
[SPEAKER_05]: would like to throw down a couple hundred
seeds of of premium rubbery and the good
[SPEAKER_05]: year and even some of the the BC work,
you know, yeah and just really go through
[SPEAKER_05]: them like the right way Unfortunately,
like I in my position, you know up until
[SPEAKER_05]: this point I've only been able to test
like 50 plants around 50 plants of each
[SPEAKER_05]: line that I make Yeah, and you know,
that's done me pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's given me some really nice
selections.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, surprisingly You know,
I really didn't think it was at first when
[SPEAKER_05]: I first started all this I didn't think it
was gonna be that easy I figured I'd have
[SPEAKER_05]: to look through a thousand seeds to to
find that one You know, and sometimes you
[SPEAKER_05]: do I feel like you know, you probably do
but you're popping haze Maybe right So I
[SPEAKER_04]: had to troll Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean sometimes you get lucky and you
find it in five Sometimes you find it in
[SPEAKER_02]: 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it takes multiple rounds because
I didn't find exactly what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting for So it just is you know,
it's it's a lot of it's a roll the dice
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of averages Yeah 50 has been
good for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I have found some amazing
seeds and our amazing plants and and 50
[SPEAKER_05]: seed populations You know, you know you do
50 seeds of premium rubber or the good
[SPEAKER_05]: year or something like that and I mean
We're talking you're gonna be seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: everything those lines have to offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's I mean, you're gonna find You're
gonna find some really really really nice
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to pop a hundred seeds You
don't even really need to pop 50,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like you just you know get a few
packs and that's another thing I'd suggest
[SPEAKER_05]: if anybody's interested in like figure out
what line you want and And buy multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: packs Yeah Am I here that's a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay early on in my in breeding Is I
would go to Amsterdam and I would buy like
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 different things Instead of buying a
bunch of packs of a few different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and having more to look through
because I got excited so sometimes having
[SPEAKER_02]: more seeds of one line is better than
having You know one pack of eight
[SPEAKER_04]: different things also from a breeders
perspective when I get orders in and since
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the one filling orders and I think you
know, it's going to be to When we see
[SPEAKER_04]: someone old order multiple packs of one
line Like 99% of the time I'm gonna hook
[SPEAKER_04]: them up with like multiple packs of other
lines, too Because I know they're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: serious stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they're being serious about what
they're doing So I'm more likely to do
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like they can but and you know,
surprisingly, it's it's it's kind of rare
[SPEAKER_05]: Not very many people do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you agree rare?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's definitely that rare and that's
why when I see it I'm like, yes,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna hook this dude up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're serious Yeah, people know what
they're doing people are on a mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know the strain they want they know
they want To find the one so they drop the
[SPEAKER_05]: money on it They make the investment and
you know, it doesn't matter what it costs
[SPEAKER_05]: as long as you get the plant that plant
you can make The sky's the limit whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: however much money you want because you
have that plant for the rest of your life
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it doesn't matter if that seed
cost $20 or $30 or $40 or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Hell at the plant will pay itself
back when you grow it from seed And then
[SPEAKER_05]: you have it forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So It's always nice to find that special
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, if you if you're gonna if
you're looking at them menu, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just just pick a line or two or whatever
that you're interested in and And get a
[SPEAKER_05]: few packs of it, you know two packs and
you're gonna you're gonna be happy with
[SPEAKER_05]: all the plants Obviously, but it's a
lottery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a numbers game when you grow seeds is
everybody knows Like I said, I got lucky
[SPEAKER_05]: with my number ten and number four They
were in the first ten seeds of a larger
[SPEAKER_05]: progeny, you know, yeah, it's just the
roll the dice sometimes But but you're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be happy I mean you're gonna be
happy with anything you get that's crossed
[SPEAKER_05]: to the River City ten They're all gonna be
really nice plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there's always some better than
others But like I said, it's just a
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers game grab, you know two three
packs That should that should be enough
[SPEAKER_05]: for most people if you're like extremely
serious, you know And you really just want
[SPEAKER_05]: to guarantee you're gonna find like just
you know one two or three or more awesome
[SPEAKER_05]: like insane blow your mind stuff then you
know make the investment and get you get
[SPEAKER_05]: you at least like 30 seeds 40 Something
like that if you can afford it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not for everybody What now that's
my advice if they want to get any of these
[SPEAKER_05]: how do they get ahold of you They I will
be doing the release this Tuesday at What
[SPEAKER_05]: time did I say it was check my notes here
real quick?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Tuesday, January 31st 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific and 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eastern time.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right Tuesday January 31st.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep Okay, I put the wrong date on them

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man Thanks for coming on and letting
everybody hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a it's an honor Yeah, thanks for
having me on the show Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I'll say to that is that
In addition to the history part that Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did One of the one of the main
reasons why we did this podcast was to
[SPEAKER_02]: give people a chance to listen to how like
weed nerds like like to chit chat about
[SPEAKER_02]: various different things and So PIP is a
is a very good friend who we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: chatting for a long time in private years
and years chatting about different stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and so It's it's cool to bring personal
friends on who have get a chance to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about their passions And their work what
they're interested in And I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: like the way he breeds is pretty neat
because he doesn't really do any hype
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff too much He kind of like if you
listen to this podcast He kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: collected strains over the years and he
picked favorites and then he decided what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens if I mix these favorites and That
is sort of like the basis for what he's
[SPEAKER_02]: been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very personal approach in my
opinion He bred things he liked Which is
[SPEAKER_02]: something I always tell people to do pick
things you like and try to find things you
[SPEAKER_02]: like You know and don't care about what
the rest of the world thinks find things
[SPEAKER_02]: that you think are interesting and I think
that this list Definitely represents that
[SPEAKER_04]: in a big way Yeah, that's a big positive
and it doesn't matter if your family gets
[SPEAKER_04]: upset that you hang out at rest stops and
with that This will be the end of the show
[SPEAKER_04]: It was
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was like I was connected with
everything around me All of a sudden I
[SPEAKER_00]: just started questioning everything I'd
ever been told You know by the time I got
[SPEAKER_00]: high that very first time When it started
to hit me And I'm like well I Got high
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a got got dude her skirt from up
north or cut upon it You You
