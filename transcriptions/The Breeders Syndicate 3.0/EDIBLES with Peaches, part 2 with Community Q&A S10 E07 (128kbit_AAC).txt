[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_04]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_04]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_04]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_04]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are The Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so how, yeah, so we had questions
about from people about this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of this is your,
you know, you don't, you can't test your
[SPEAKER_00]: weed at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know if it's exactly 20% or 23
or 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to use flour,
I mean, you can look at your flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: make a good guesstimate of like what you
think if you're getting a 20% THC flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with flour, you can look at it
where, okay, so one gram of flour is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have 200 milligrams of THC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's how you can, you know,
then you can figure out, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I've got, you know, this many grams of
flour, then that, you know, you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: your math from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I use hash, like bubble hash or even
dry sieve, dry sift and I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift before you clean it up would be
at a ratio where I figure about you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with the 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have probably 50% heads
and others and 50% THC when you're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with just hash or dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every one gram, you're going to get
500 milligrams of THC with those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you move to rosin, it's more
along the lines of like with the FECO
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's going to be up around 60 to 80%
of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I wash, I've had several
batches tested now and my hash comes in at
[SPEAKER_00]: over 80% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I saw somebody's temple ball results
and that temple ball came in at only 60%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's because it wasn't made into
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was made from the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I said that hash you can
figure in at 50% and you'll be probably
[SPEAKER_00]: safe with your guesstimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rosin, you can figure 60 to 80% if
you're doing a good job as far as like the
[SPEAKER_00]: one gram will equal 600 to 800 milligrams
of THC for every gram you put into
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the math I've always used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, without a bunch of lab tests and
all that, we can't be scientifically
[SPEAKER_00]: exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my bro science has worked that way so
far.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even call it bro science,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're just being consistent within
what you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just knowing that like,
how would I put it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Partly it's because you know what you're
working with, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the flour you're working
with, you know, it's consistent,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the hash you're working with,
you know, you know, it's consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think everyone just has to develop
that sense of, you know, their own
[SPEAKER_02]: material and consistently working with it
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, like some of those, I think are
just broadly good tips, like thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the material working within these
little chunks and just trying to estimate
[SPEAKER_02]: like, OK, if X percent of this chunk is
going to be, you know, this mass is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be THC, then, you know, roughly this,
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like you said as well,
ultimately, no guarantee without actual
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can, like you're describing,
definitely find a process that's
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent for you, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did, of course, mention the fact that,
like, again, different kinds of material,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, flour versus hash versus rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any any other tips there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had someone who was asking
about dry sift in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is there anything, you know,
that you could say to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it, you know, ultimately the same
same question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that if now if you static tech
your dry sift, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better ratio of THC because you're,
you know, pulling out mostly heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do a dry sift, I always go with
the 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's half hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be one gram is going to have
500 milligrams of THC in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really easy to say easy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a standard for guessing how much
THC is in something like I see a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff being like, OK, there's 500
milligrams of THC with all the strains
[SPEAKER_04]: testing different and having different
ratios of stuff like how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a guessing game unless it's going
to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is because you can't,
you know, like I said, unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that flour tested first and then
or you're having that hash tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only guesstimate based on,
you know, what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see in your hand the quality of your
flour, the quality of the dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it all it's just like with hash,
whatever quality goes in is the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality you're going to get out from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in, shit out, as I always say.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I guess it just comes back to
having whether or not you have some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of sense of internal consistency,
at least like within what you're making.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at least then, like if someone is
buying or consuming your product,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least you have some kind of internal
measure that you're like using.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least your base units are sort of
consistent, I guess.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a tangent off that is how much of a
hassle is it to get these things tested as
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who doesn't live in the US and
can't do that ever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's it like to get your products
tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even had a chance to get my
edibles to market to be tested yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know when the last thing I was
working on was the water soluble drops
[SPEAKER_00]: that we made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, my gosh, I think we sent it to
testing three different times because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can only have 100 milligrams in the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to do the whole formula where we
knew how much THC was per milligram of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a 10 milligram package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to figure out how much we
had to mix with water in order to get 100
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams into that 10 milligram package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was off by a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was exactly on,
like, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the exact ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to readjust it and send it back
and then it tested over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to come back and be readjusted
and sent back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it tested at the right level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never known I had to do so much math.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much math.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really in, like, chemistry
territory, almost much more so than,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, a regular grower would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're both in extracts and
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize as well that your greatest
enemy is chlorophyll in all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your biggest enemies in both sides
is chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the thing is, is that
chlorophyll actually does have been
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it does good things for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there's certain things like you
don't want it in your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you don't like the taste
of weed, then you're not going to like the
[SPEAKER_00]: taste of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you make crimp smoothies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because since I don't like the taste
of it, what I do do is I make a juice
[SPEAKER_00]: filled leaf and then I freeze dry that
juice and I powder it up into a capsule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, is this to get some of that,
like, THCA, quote unquote, or like,
[SPEAKER_02]: why would you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the actual raw cannabis plant is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's got anti-inflammatory
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cancer fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fifteen raw cannabis leaves a day is
enough to fight off any type of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since what part of why I did the
capsules is because, like, for one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't always have fresh cannabis
leaves around and a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and by juicing it, I got it down to
where I can juice it and then I freeze it
[SPEAKER_00]: and freeze dry it and powder it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have it down to where I have got 15
leaves into one capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take one of these capsules and
freeze drying doesn't it leaves you with
[SPEAKER_00]: 97 percent of the nutrients of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't degrade it like when you
dehydrate something or let it dry
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't degrade the nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're still it's like taking that
raw cannabis still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in a powdered form that you can
just pop and take and have anywhere with
[SPEAKER_00]: you any time of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a time when I would top my
plants and just eat tops like immediately,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a pretty full on experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the flavor is intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should try the juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a weird ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made Buckshot try the juice from the
juicer and he was like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be like drinking wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so gross.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably worse man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably even more intense than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever drank wheatgrass?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've had people give me shots of that
before to like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I have but not for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so foul and bitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the worst kind of bitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just instant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It triggers my instant gag reflexes.
[SPEAKER_04]: People enjoy drinking it though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I've had full leaves, the main thing
I think that that gets me is they often
[SPEAKER_02]: taste very peppery to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is like quite a full on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was next?
[SPEAKER_02]: So another point about oils into capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great way.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, Electric Lady Land asked
about the RSO concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great way to go into that
because and address his question as well
[SPEAKER_00]: is in my opinion, when you make the RSO or
FICO, whatever you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you evaporate the alcohol,
it then becomes a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, in my opinion, what I would call
a tincture at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was still in the alcohol,
it would be like a tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you evaporate that off,
it concentrates it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will take that RSO and put it into
MCT oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put those into capsules because
for cancer patients, sometimes the,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, for one, the taste of RSO is
horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to put it in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people put it on toast or
crackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you use the concentrate itself,
too, it's really hard to get it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: capsule of its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you put it into like,
I like to use MCT oil, and then it can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a capsule, just like you could take
your rosin pucks after you press your
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin and you can soak those in MCT oil to
extract what's left in there out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can turn those into capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have something that you can
have a titrated dosage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with the RSO, I can get them to where
there's, I want to say like 150 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: per capsule so that somebody wants to make
sure they take a thousand milligrams a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take, they know I would need to
take 10 of these capsules a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I found the capsules to be
helpful because a lot of people are used
[SPEAKER_00]: to taking pills anyways, and they don't
mind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you don't have the taste or
any of the inconvenience of dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual FECO or RSO itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think capsules in general are a great
way to make it look less scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, even though in a much more
amateurish way, you know, make my own oil
[SPEAKER_02]: and occasionally we'll give them to
friends who are not into smoking at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because like you said, they're in
capsule form, you know, it's a lot less,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, scary or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, something that we're comfortable
with and accustomed to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old and loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, good tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else about that capsules?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, actually the preservative a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause okay, oil, when you mix stuff in
oil, you have a tendency, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're using leaf,
you're introducing stuff into the oil that
[SPEAKER_00]: could cause it to go bad faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can choose to use a
preservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this with your gummies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause gummies have a tendency to go bad
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lorraine candies sells a mold inhibitor
that you can buy and use that in your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing they use in all kinds
of different things to preserve stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to get more on the
natural side of things, there's a Rosemary
[SPEAKER_00]: oil that is a preservative that you can
put into the oil before you make the
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about them
going bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like, you make a bunch of oil to
start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would keep your oil from, you know,
expiring if you didn't use it within a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple months or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're using the
capsules and you want to do a bunch at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you'll know that it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if they turn cloudy in the capsule,
you know, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take a cloudy capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I finished this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had somebody that messaged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't my capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had gotten them from a weed for
warriors donation and they sent me a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, do not take those when
that oil and those capsules turns cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it's expiring and it could be
like botulism could be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be all kinds of stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you put plant material in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always caution people that if we're
whatever reason your oil turns cloudy or
[SPEAKER_00]: your capsules, just it's, you got to have
to take the loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question about spoiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I mentioned, you know,
I'll make like a big batch at the start of
[SPEAKER_02]: the year and I was chucking in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really see it go off, but is that partly
because it's in the fridge?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking about products that,
you know, lie around at room temp or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically something in the fridge go
off, you know, just as easily,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fridge will keep it preserved longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was, that's definitely a great
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any cannabis product to make sure it
lasts longer because anything that sits
[SPEAKER_00]: out at room temperature is going to go bad
faster, especially those oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you have capsules, yeah,
I tell anybody I give capsules to put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fridge, you know, they'll stay
fresher that way and last a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, thankfully haven't seen
capsules turn cloudy yet, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that doesn't sound right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't sound good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not ideal.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I mention this on the, while we were
recording, I can't remember, but I know at
[SPEAKER_02]: least before the recording, we were
talking about how this might just be part
[SPEAKER_02]: one in a sense of like a series
potentially, because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we could obviously ask Peaches to talk to
us about the various you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: products that she actually has experience
with, but I think today was mostly about
[SPEAKER_02]: getting some of this foundational stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did have a kind of like last little
section, maybe before we get to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the community questions on, was it,
what was your idea like broadly baking and
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and time with respect to
baking Peaches?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cause I've been doing edibles for a
long time and before there was a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: research, like I remember whenever I baked
anything, I would bake it at like 200
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees for way longer cause I didn't want
it to get over a certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, everybody's done some
more studies and you know, you can bake
[SPEAKER_00]: your brownies at 350 in the oven cause the
actual internal temperature of your
[SPEAKER_00]: brownie doesn't get to 350 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but you have to keep in mind cause
I see people who will like be frying
[SPEAKER_00]: things in oil and medicated oil and the
fryer oils medicated and they're frying in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, that temperature is
too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that THC has been like fried out and
converted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to actually get high from
frying something in the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just the one thing I've learned
with baking though, is that I used to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to bake things at a lower temperature and
now I've found that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just bake them at the regular
temperature for your regular length of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a tendency though, like I don't
always buy it when something's over 400
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tendency to turn it down and cook
it for longer with, you know, certain
[SPEAKER_00]: baked items, but I have found that just
leaving it at regular temperature is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it used to take me a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do snickerdoodles were one of my
favorites to make and man, it would take
[SPEAKER_00]: like an hour to bake a thing of cookies at
a low temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just funny to see how things
have, you know, come full circle when
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done something for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's new information out there
and we used to all be so careful about not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm like, well, let's just put my
brownies in at 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, technically we're kind of out in
terms of the points that you wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: address Peaches, but I wonder just because
we've mentioned it quite a few times and
[SPEAKER_02]: just to give maybe everyone a almost like
a sneak preview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you give us an overview of the gummy
making process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a broad overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or your one anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have two cause you can make it,
you can make rest without gelatin and do
[SPEAKER_00]: it with fruit juice and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are a little more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a little more setting up in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite go-to gummy recipe is just
with some gelatin, jello and glycerin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really basic and simple and you
can whip it up and have gummies ready like
[SPEAKER_00]: in two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one you could go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use either oil or alcohol or
glycerin with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will post like if we want to start a
thread, I'll post the actual recipe up for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody with the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just use a one it's a small box of
jello and two packs of gelatin and then
[SPEAKER_00]: your carrier oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to use the mold inhibitor
because gummies will mold quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just heat it up on the stove,
melt it all and you pour it into the molds
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it set and chill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you keep them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, like I said, in like two
hours you got gummies ready to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was for some reason,
I thought it was way more grown out of
[SPEAKER_02]: process than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially it's assuming you have your
oil or your glycerin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of mixing it together
and putting in the molds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process you're thinking of is the one
where you like, if you're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of like, because some people don't
want to use gelatin or jello.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use the pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use agar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, cause somebody had a question
about pectin and it being having
[SPEAKER_00]: containing pesticides, which is a,
you know, excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that they do offer a certified
organic apple pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the agar is another option if you
want to avoid that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that process is more drawn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you use the fruit juice and
you got to warm that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your carrier goes in and you got
to, you know, add your pectin or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using and cook it and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those ones usually have to,
yeah, they sit out and like, they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones have to be sugared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I assume that people are staying
away from gelatin because they don't like
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that it's from what horse hoops,
horse hoops.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one other thing though is
castorium.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
Castorium.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is in a lot of like gummy worms and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the, it's something extracted from
the anal gland of a beaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they get raspberry extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody eating beaver assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just waiting to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I kind of find this stuff
fascinating because like so many things
[SPEAKER_02]: come from super strange places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, those like, there's that
particular, is it the red color that they
[SPEAKER_02]: get from the shell of a particular like
beetle or something and they have to crush
[SPEAKER_02]: them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of remember, yeah, this stuff
fascinates me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Castorium, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look before you eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beaver butt hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like the anal gland too,
on top of all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gland even.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even better.
Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might be a good time for us to get to
some of those community questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we addressed some, but there are a
few more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that these questions also cover
some extract stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, Peaches is our resident
extract and edibles person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just start from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one from Herb's SD on gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we covered this already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an easy way to turn rosin into
gummies?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best feral oil to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any trick in getting them not to separate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would get sunflower or lecithin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be your first thing to make them
not separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other key when you're going to use oil
is doing the stacking method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not like, so you can use a half
a cup of oil instead of a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the less oil you use, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can stack that batch,
so you get more into it, then you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be better off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that the gelatin gummy recipe works
better with the oil than the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: does in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just, you need an emulsifier to
make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alice D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find different cultivars give
different effects in the edibles?
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be one of those ones
again, where it's like super complex and
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, never really know, I guess,
until you try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's really hard to
always have one cultivar in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you'd have to grow so much of that
specific one, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of hard in that sense,
unless, you know, we've got, like I have
[SPEAKER_00]: before, like I said, made a batch of
tincture from all strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you that batch of tincture
smelled just like the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool that it actually tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some, now I want some blue,
I want some blue edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on the map.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of closely related.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know why edibles are hit or miss
for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like why they work sometimes and sometimes
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, do you think this is partly
cultivar related peaches or is there
[SPEAKER_02]: something else you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say the first thing would be
the decarboxylation because some people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that someone has gotten
edibles that weren't decarped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they're from the same source and
you know, they worked that yesterday,
[SPEAKER_00]: today, they didn't seem to work the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time that you ate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a full stomach, it's going to
take longer for you to process that
[SPEAKER_00]: through your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you eat it on an empty stomach,
it'll hit you faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your metabolism plays a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, you're going to fill it in 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people, it's going to take two
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I always tell is sometimes
people's math is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they think is 500 milligrams is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that you just got a low
dose edible and you're used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the whole fact where
cannabis is totally metabolized in the
[SPEAKER_00]: liver and it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the microsomal cytochrome and
that is what helps that makes you get
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It delivers it to your blood system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people have a gene variant in that
specific CYP2C9 receptor and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: allow them to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't process the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get into their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't get high from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to clarify, you mean when they eat
it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But these people will still get high from
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because that's a different effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole other thing is so we
all have cannabinoid receptors so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it works on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us have 10,000 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us have 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you eat the cannabis, if you have
100, then your system is going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: flooded because you only have so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got 10,000 receptors,
that same amount of cannabis is not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to work the same on you as it does with
someone with 100 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the other facts besides
that liver enzyme that plays a role as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as when you eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that factor, whether it's decarbs,
I think that's all the factors that would
[SPEAKER_00]: go into why it would or wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of as complex,
maybe arguably more complex because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're more layers, as the question of
why some cultivar might get someone high
[SPEAKER_02]: and someone not or why it affects someone
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many variables here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down to the process, down to the flower
itself, down to our bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, very similar, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Next question would have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's about washing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if actually I might just
direct them to checking out the first
[SPEAKER_02]: episode we did with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Blaza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Newbie intro to washing kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's more wanting to learn to wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we cover this in the first episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even really remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: His thing was about like essential
equipment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say just to touch quickly,
your essential equipment to wash at home
[SPEAKER_00]: would be you need bags, at least five
gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to hold ice, you're gonna need
scoops, something to wash with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your basic, something to dry on,
you want some screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be, oh, a sprayer for
spraying down your bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've mentioned that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be your main
essentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as if, I think you asked
about with edible, some of the main things
[SPEAKER_00]: I use regularly is the double boiler,
my convection oven, my other oven before I
[SPEAKER_00]: had the convection oven, thermometer,
strainers, my nut milk bags and a scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we covered mountain flowers hemp's
question, which was on pectin and gummies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to add that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has really good hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has really good hemp and mountain
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got electric lady land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You covered that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even I think Zaza Papa, i.e.
[SPEAKER_02]: in the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is it to have a repeatable
product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we covered this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of about uniformity again as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did talk about being consistent
with your process, some of your
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements, but ultimately it does come
down to testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only way I can give you an
absolute guarantee.
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, yeah, Peters did cover what
she tries to do to ensure consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the questions that we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get sub-robs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a very detailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, you can put Keith in the butter,
but you're going to want to decarboxylate
[SPEAKER_00]: it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about Keith is it is spicy when
you eat it.
Spicy?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use it to make edibles,
it's spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made edibles with Keith that are
almost hard to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it different from other extracts?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just hits, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it different?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't researched it very much,
but there's definitely something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, the rosin is kind of spicy,
but not as spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think maybe it's because it's been
processed and squashed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps hold back maybe some of that
material that you're getting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with Keith, you still got the
stocks and others in there when you make
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said your ratio is about
50-50 for THC to the Keith ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with rosin, when you press it,
that stuff gets trapped in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, rosin edibles taste more like rosin
and hash than they do weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Keith, to me, doesn't taste like
weed, but it tastes spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, when you ate the weed
plant, the top of the weed plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it tastes spicy to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming maybe it's in the stock of
the THC head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to separate the head,
but you have the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, maybe that stock is what
is spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith is, but rosin isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably another good prompt for people to
chime in in the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've experienced this, let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: More data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I find that really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as the amount you would put
into that butter, it would be on how
[SPEAKER_00]: strong do you want your brownies to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will, once you melt it in there,
it'll disperse evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to mix it in really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would depend on how strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one gram of Keith and that's going
to be 500 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you're doing a brownie batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most brownies have nine in the pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want each brownie to have 500
milligrams, well, then you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to add nine grams of Keith to that
butter to make that brownie have that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing my math correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better than mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take your word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure somebody will point it out to me
if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all the questions we've got,
but I, because, okay, by the time this
[SPEAKER_02]: episode comes out, I think it's going to
be January or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we're recording this,
it's the 20th, well, 21st, no 19th for you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20th of December for me and probably going
to be the last record for the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, so I kind of wanted to take
the opportunity to ask Peaches what,
[SPEAKER_02]: what she has in store for 2024,
just for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I'm going peach crazy on the
Hill this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a big chase for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it's been like five years now that
I've been at actually searching and so
[SPEAKER_00]: finding it is, is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be definitely trying some
breeding this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with that peach, you know,
I have some, some plans that I want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, and I'm hoping that this year
they, I just got a message from my boss up
[SPEAKER_00]: there talking to me about moving up a
trailer cause they're ready to start
[SPEAKER_00]: ramping up full time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which means I'll be working up there
five days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my finger crossed that all goes
through and works out and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be all worth the while that I spent
the last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you cut out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you, I think you're cutting out dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, hopefully that goes through,
um, we have an investor lined up that's
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to bring a good amount of money
to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, then that means a regular
paycheck for me on paper and it'll be a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole different world.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be nice, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it goes through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make me proud.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try.
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, uh, that's more or less us for,
for today, for this one, for the year,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, Peaches, like I mentioned
earlier, uh, may welcome back for,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the next outdoor growing episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay tuned for that whenever that
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's kind of it for me really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, anything from either of you shout outs
wise or anything else to add to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this, this episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no, just at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, if anybody has
any questions, uh, they want recipes or
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, we can either start a thread or
message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, come check it out on
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give away a lot of information on there
to people help you guys make your
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so come join the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll help you hook you up with some tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it goes down.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, apart from, um, you know, best wishes
to everyone over the new year break again,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time you see this, uh, that would
have passed already, but hope you have had
[SPEAKER_02]: a happy holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and otherwise we are on the cusp of
hitting 10,000 subs, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I have a small wager, uh,
about when that will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Matt, I'm saying it will happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When, when was it that you go January,
beginning of January.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said specifically beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you've made it even more
ambitious now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you, I thought you were saying
it was like mid-jan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying it's the style?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beginning of January, bro, we are hitting
10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't, I'm stopping the show and
nobody gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all or nothing guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you guys better do it or no more show
essentially is where it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Service going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just close it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all quitting weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never going to smoke again.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get a new career teaching kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll teach kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to my old job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Math or English.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: History history.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I really belong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that's doing God's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely challenging,
but it was never challenging really
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the students.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always challenging because I love
the kids.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand it over to you just to sign us off.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you enjoy the episode,
be sure to leave some comments below.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to respond to everyone, but I
definitely read every single comment that
[SPEAKER_04]: comes through as I'm pretty sure 1000 does
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We both are big on reading the comments
and responding.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the time this comes out,
the diesel drops should have happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: The diesel Femme hybrids and S1s right
seats.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have the blue dream S1s out and a
few of the hybrids, but there's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be a lot more coming with the blue dream
ones from goat form.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check the site for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some of the silver mountains from
high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: The silver pearl Appalachia insane insane
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get our spray at the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also check out Gert by seeds for
Australian carrying of the breeder
[SPEAKER_04]: syndicate stuff, which includes all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also who do we have lifted seeds
in the US as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good friend of ours carrying all of
our stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have right to go Europe for our
European fans for the riot seed stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully we can get him some stuff
over from the rest of the syndicate as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's a codex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check out our codex.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to add some more to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully over the Christmas vacation,
I'm going to have time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be another fun adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could do a little episode on
whatever you end up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Updating.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even just a round up, you know,
of the changes you've made or new
[SPEAKER_02]: information you've gotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think also going through it like one by
one on the screen with it on and like
[SPEAKER_04]: going through and talking about things
that maybe I don't even add on there
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're too controversial,
but that I'd like to add, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given I could even see that being like a
live stream kind of vibe to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have a I have a bad habit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a bad habit of like deleting my
live streams after for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just get I don't like what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like what I hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how I am with editing myself,
like even when I'm editing, like there was
[SPEAKER_04]: a long period of time where I just cut out
everything I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually going to say that even
those Instagram lives that you do,
[SPEAKER_02]: those you could just slap those on YouTube
and people would probably enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never say I fucking hate myself on
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, now you can use Streamyard for it,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and yeah, that's that's a good
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be using Streamyard for the live
feature tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next stage stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is anyway, that's the end of the
episode.
